(22), (26), (33), (42), (44), (49), (54), (55), (56), (60), 146, 147, 151, 156, 158, 166, 167, 169, 171, 172, 182 and 270 The bill introduces a tax credit for research and development activities conducted by New Zealand businesses. This brings New Zealand into line with many other countries which offer tax concessions for R&D. The rationale for R&D tax concessions is that there is under-investment by businesses in R&D because the investing firm does not capture all of the benefits of the investment. Some of the benefit is captured by other businesses or consumers. The tax incentive is intended to provide an offset for the likely spill-over benefits to other firms and individuals in New Zealand. This is expected to help transform the New Zealand economy into a high-skill, knowledge-based economy. There will be an evaluation of the credit in three years to determine whether it is effective in meeting these objectives. The credit is available for eligible businesses that have eligible expenditure on “research and development activities”. We outline some of the eligibility requirements below, focussing on those that are the subject of submissions. Eligibility requirements In the bill as introduced, in order to be eligible, a claimant must be in business in New Zealand, with a fixed establishment in New Zealand. The expenditure for which a claim is made must relate to that business. Crown research institutes, tertiary institutions, and district health boards, their associates and entities under their control are not eligible for the credit. A claimant must bear the financial and technical risk of the project, have control over the work and own the project results. When R&D is outsourced, this distinguishes the person who commissions the R&D (who is eligible for the credit) from the person who merely performs that R&D (who is not eligible). This ensures that the incentive is provided to the party making R&D investment decisions and that there are not two claims for the same R&D. The claimant must have at least $20,000 of eligible R&D expenditure in a year unless the R&D services are purchased from a listed research provider. The R&D must be conducted predominantly in New Zealand. The credit can apply for R&D conducted overseas up to a limit of 10 percent of the eligible expenditure incurred in New Zealand where the project must be based. Businesses can do more R&D overseas but it does not attract the credit. R&D activities must be systematic, investigative and experimental. They must either seek to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty or involve an appreciable element of novelty and be directed at acquiring new knowledge or creating new or improved products or processes. These are “core” R&D activities. Certain activities are excluded from core activities, as they are in other jurisdictions, generally to delineate more clearly the boundary between innovative and routine business activity. Activities that support core R&D activities can be eligible. 4 Eligible expenditure includes the cost of employee remuneration, training and travel, depreciation of tangible assets used primarily in conducting R&D, certain overhead costs, consumables, and payments to entities conducting R&D on behalf of the claimant. Certain expenditure is ineligible. The main items are interest, loss on sale or write-off of depreciable property, the cost of acquiring core technology (technology used as a basis for further R&D), expenditure funded from a government grant or the required co-funding, expenditure on intangible assets and professional fees in determining eligibility. There is a cap of $2 million on eligible expenditure when the R&D core activity is in- house-use software development. This can be waived by the Minister of Finance when the R&D is in the national interest. Claimants under common control that undertake software development will be required to calculate this expenditure as a group and to allocate the cap between members. Submissions Thirty-six submissions were received on R&D tax credits and generally supported their introduction. NZICA noted its general preference for a low-rate, broad-based tax system that does not create incentives for certain activities over others. A general theme, expressed both in submissions and consultation with submitters, was that clear legislation and guidelines were important, with wide consultation on guidelines. Submissions covered a wide range of concerns, focussing on the requirements to be in business, undertake R&D related to the business and to control and bear the risk of the R&D, the exclusion of Crown research institutes, tertiary institutions and district health boards and entities associated with them, the limit on R&D done overseas, the exclusion of required co-funding when a grant is provided and the $2 million cap on internal software development. Key issue: sustainability of credit The key issue for the government and private sector is sustainability of the credit. Overseas experience is that stability in the scope of an R&D tax concession is a critical factor in increasing R&D. If the credit is not fiscally sustainable, it will be reduced in scope and business confidence in it will be eroded, reducing its effectiveness. In proposing amendments to the bill and responding to submissions, officials have therefore adopted a cautious approach to reduce the likelihood that substantive changes to reduce the scope of the concession will subsequently be required. To ensure that the credit is sustainable, it is important that it rewards R&D and not routine business activity or expenditure. In designing the credit, therefore, the government has drawn on aspects of the R&D definitions and expenditure rules in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland, where concessions have proved sustainable. It has also considered the practical experience of overseas jurisdictions in administering the credit where certain activities – such as internal software development and retrospective claims – have proved problematic. 5 PURPOSE TEST Clause 100 Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 44 – Fisher & Paykel, 37 – Zespri, 60 – Building Research, 74 – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The R&D legislation should contain a “purpose” section as an aid to its interpretation. Comment A number of submissions note that the Australian R&D tax legislation has a purpose provision and have proposed that the New Zealand R&D provisions should also have one. NZICA and the Corporate Taxpayers Group go further to suggest that the purpose provision should be similar to that in Australia as much of the New Zealand legislation is modelled on the Australian R&D provisions. The purpose clause in Australia is: The object of this section is to provide a tax incentive ...to make eligible companies more internationally competitive by: (a) encouraging the development by eligible companies of innovative products, processes and services; and (b) increasing investment by eligible companies in defined research and development activities; and (c) promoting the technological advancement of eligible companies through a focus on innovation and high technical risk in defined research and development activities; and (d) encouraging the use by eligible companies of strategic research and development planning; and (e) creating an environment that is conducive to increased commercialisation of new processes and product technologies developed by eligible companies. The benefits of the tax incentive are targeted by being limited to particular expenditure on certain defined activities. Purpose provisions are intended to give clear legislative expression to the underlying purpose of the provisions in question, and to set out their objectives, goals and conceptual basis. They are operative parts of legislation, with the same status as other provisions (not superior or of overriding status). They can give guidance to taxpayers, Inland Revenue and the courts about how the legislation should be applied and interpreted. Submissions argue that a purpose clause would provide useful guidance for Inland Revenue as the tax credit is an entirely new line of business for them and one which requires a different mindset. 6 The rationale for the credit is the likely existence of externalities when businesses invest in R&D. That is, some of the benefits that arise from a business doing R&D are captured by other businesses. These wider benefits that arise from R&D are expected to help make New Zealand businesses more internationally competitive and transform the New Zealand economy into one that is more innovative. A purpose clause would therefore refer to externalities. However, there is no requirement or reference in the substantive R&D provisions to externalities because the test would be difficult to apply at the individual business level. To incorporate the concept into a purpose clause is therefore likely to cause greater uncertainty than clarity. The Australian purpose provision is an unsuitable model because it does not refer to externalities. The Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the introduction of the Australian purpose clause states that the reason for the insertion of the purpose section was to narrow the interpretation of the definition of R&D activities by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court. In deciding cases before the introduction of the purpose section, those bodies had referred to the purpose clause in an associated R&D Act. This resulted in the Tribunal and Court interpreting the definition of R&D in tax legislation more widely than intended. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 7 REQUIREMENTS FOR ELIGIBILITY Clause 100 Issue: Requirement to be in business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment Submissions (37 – Zespri, 40 – NZ Bio, 61 – KPMG, 74 – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There should be no requirement for a claimant to be in business because this excludes research entities in a group that do R&D work on a cost recovery basis. Possible alternatives would be “enterprise” (in the Australian GST legislation) or “taxable activity” (NZ GST legislation). (Zespri, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The concept of a taxable activity (as defined for GST purposes) should be substituted for the requirement to carry on a business. (KPMG) The wording of the business test should be amended to ensure the test is not too narrowly applied thereby excluding trusts and charities. An alternative could be that an eligible person must carry on a profession, trade or undertaking in New Zealand with a reasonable expectation to profit from those activities. (Deloitte) The tax credit should be available to overseas investors in business in New Zealand who commission contract R&D regardless of whether they have a fixed establishment in New Zealand. (NZ Bio) Comment The aim of the credit is to encourage businesses to invest in R&D to secure the wider benefits to New Zealand that this R&D may generate. The requirement that the claimant be in business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment is designed to ensure that the credit is provided to claimants with a commercial activity within the New Zealand tax base. The credit is designed to reside with the party making the decisions about how much R&D should be undertaken and what that R&D should be. The claimant therefore should be the party commissioning the R&D rather than the performer of the R&D. There does not appear to be sufficient justification for creating an exception to this rule for entities that do their R&D on a cost recovery basis within a group structure. The member of the group commissioning the R&D should be able to claim the credit in its own right. 8 Adopting a GST-based definition of “business” would inappropriately broaden the scope of the credit. The income tax definition of “business” requires an intention to make a pecuniary profit and therefore reflects the intention of the credit as an incentive to business R&D and to require there to be commercial activity. The GST concept of “taxable activity” targets economic activity more widely and would apply to entities such as government departments. We do not consider it necessary to amend the income tax definition of “business” to ensure that trusts and charities in business can access the concession. The term “business” already applies to these organisations within the income tax legislation and should therefore not pose any barriers to them claiming the concession. The requirement that non-resident claimants have a fixed establishment in New Zealand is aimed at ensuring that they have businesses within the New Zealand tax base. Without a permanent establishment, the application of double tax treaties would mean that they are not subject to income tax in New Zealand. This requirement could appear to be in conflict with the eligibility of tax-exempts. However, exemption from tax is a consequence of overriding social policy objectives. NZ Bio states that overseas investors with a business in New Zealand who commission R&D carried out locally should be able to access the tax concession regardless of whether they have a fixed establishment. Without a fixed establishment the income derived by such businesses in New Zealand would not be taxed in New Zealand. While there may be some benefits to the New Zealand economy in subsidising foreign firms the objective of economic transformation is not to decrease costs for foreign firms, making them more internationally competitive. Therefore we do not support this submission. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Submission (Matter raised by officials) The requirement to have a fixed establishment should apply only to non-resident claimants. Comment As currently formulated, the requirement to have a fixed establishment in New Zealand applies to residents and non-residents. The criteria for determining whether a fixed establishment, which includes having a substantial business, determine which jurisdiction should be able to tax a business, and are not relevant if the business is a resident. Therefore requiring residents to have a fixed establishment is unnecessarily restrictive on resident firms. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 9 Issue: Start-up businesses Submission (40 – NZ Bio) A person who starts a business part-way through an income year should qualify for a tax credit if they meet the eligibility requirements of proposed section LH 2(2). Comment A taxpayer should be eligible to make a claim for any part of the year that they meet the eligibility requirements and also have relevant expenditure or an amount of depreciation loss. We agree that the legislation could be drafted more clearly to give effect to that intention. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Partnerships carrying on R&D Submission (Matter raised by officials) If a partnership meets the eligibility requirements the partners should be treated as having satisfied those requirements. Comment The tests of eligibility, such as being in business and meeting the minimum threshold, are also applied at the partnership level. However tax credits are claimed by individual partners rather than the partnership. Therefore it is necessary to treat partners as having met those requirements, in relation to R&D activities carried out by the partnership, if the partnership has met those requirements. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 10 Issue: R&D activities must be related to business of claimant Submission (37 – Zespri, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 61 – KPMG, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The requirement that activities must be related to the business of the claimant should be removed. (Zespri, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, KPMG) Confirmation is required that the term “business” in proposed section LH 2(2)(a)(i) will be given a wide interpretation to include both an existing business and any potential business of a claimant. This clarification could be provided in a Tax Information Bulletin. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment The requirement that R&D activities must be related to the business of the claimant is intended to reduce the opportunity for a firm commissioning research to transfer the ability to claim the concession to another party. Particularly, if the firm commissioning the R&D activities is not entitled to claim the concession in relation to those activities, it should not be possible to transfer the activity to another party so that the other party can claim the concession instead. However, the concession should be available to a claimant who undertakes R&D that is not directly related to their current business if it is carried out with a view to starting a new business. We agree that the requirement that the R&D activity must be related to the business of the claimant should be expanded to include a prospective new business of the claimant. Nevertheless, this expenditure would need to meet the general deductibility requirements in section LH 2. Recommendation That the submission to remove the requirement that R&D activities must be related to the business of the claimant be declined. That the submission that the term “business” should include a prospective business be accepted. Issue: Election to defer deduction for R&D expenditure Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 74 – Deloitte) The eligibility criteria should be amended to include as eligible for the tax credit R&D expenditure deferred in accordance with section EJ 21 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The deferred expenditure should be eligible in the year incurred. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte) 11 Comment Under proposed section LH 2(2), to be eligible for the tax credit the claimant must have expenditure on R&D activities and the expenditure must be deductible in the year in which it is incurred. This means that R&D expenditure that taxpayers have elected to deduct in a future year, under rules recently introduced to allow them to do so in section EJ 21 of the Income Tax Act 2004, will not be eligible for the credit. Those rules were introduced to prevent a company with no income in the year in which expenditure is incurred from accruing tax losses that are forfeited when new shareholders are brought in to raise capital. Submissions propose that such expenditure should be eligible for the credit in the year it is incurred, although the deduction for it will be taken at a later date. We agree that this is the correct treatment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Prepayments Submission (Matter raised by officials) To be eligible for a credit, a person must have expenditure on R&D that is deductible in the year in which it is incurred. Expenditure that is incurred in one year and by virtue of a general timing provision is deductible in a subsequent year (such as prepayments) will therefore not be eligible. It should be eligible in the year in which it is deductible. Comment Under certain general timing rules in the Income Tax Act 2004, expenditure that is incurred in one year will, by virtue of an add-back mechanism, be deductible in a subsequent year. So, for example, if a taxpayer prepays expenditure on goods, a deduction for the expenditure on the goods not used in that year is deferred until the goods are used. Such deferred expenditure will not meet the eligibility requirement that R&D expenditure must be deductible in the year in which it is incurred. In these situations, it is deductible in a subsequent year. The credit should be available in the year in which the expenditure is deductible as that is the year in which the nexus with R&D should be tested. Under this rule, in the case of prepaid goods, the credit would apply if and when the goods are used for R&D. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 12 Issue: Capital expenditure Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 74 – Deloitte) It should be explicit that capital expenditure on assets is eligible for the R&D tax credit (for example, a unique infrastructure asset). It appears this outcome is intended to be achieved by subsection LH 2(2)(e)(iii) but this is not clear from the drafting. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Comment Capital expenditure is expenditure on creating or acquiring an asset that will provide an enduring benefit to an entity. It is generally deductible over the income-earning life of the asset. In the R&D context, this refers to expenditure that is capitalised for accounting because if expenditure is expensed for accounting it is generally immediately deductible for tax. Facilitative assets Capital expenditure on assets that are not the object of the R&D activities but that are used in R&D (“facilitative assets” such as buildings) are depreciated and annual depreciation deductions are eligible for the credit. End-result assets Capital expenditure on creating or improving assets that are the object of the R&D activities (“end-result assets”) is dealt with in section LH 2(2)(e)(iii). We agree that these rules are unclear and propose that they be redrafted as follows. It is assumed that such expenditure is linked with the income earning process of the business. End-result intangible assets Capital expenditure incurred in seeking to create a depreciable intangible asset as the object of the R&D activities should attract the credit when it is incurred. Such expenditure would include the cost of labour, materials and depreciation on facilitative assets used in developing the asset. End-result tangible assets used solely for R&D Capital expenditure incurred in seeking to create a depreciable tangible asset that is developed as the object of the R&D activities (such as a prototype or innovative plant) should attract the credit when it is incurred only when it is to be used solely for R&D (for example, in testing) and not for any other purpose by that business or an associate. The expenditure would include the cost of labour, materials and depreciation on facilitative assets used in developing the prototype. 13 End-result tangible assets used partly for R&D and partly for commercial purposes Capital expenditure of a business should not attract the credit when it is incurred if it is incurred in constructing a depreciable tangible asset that: • is the object of the R&D activities; and • is developed for use in the business other than in the R&D process. A prototype may be used initially in the R&D process (for example, for testing) but either simultaneously or subsequently be used for commercial purposes. Alternatively, once developed, it may be sold to an associate for use in the income earning activity of the associate. In such circumstances, and assuming such construction is eligible R&D, depreciation on the asset while it is being used for R&D should attract the credit. Example A Co is a utility company experimenting with a new material for underground pipes. It constructs a small area of the network for testing before rolling out the pipes in the region. Assume that the construction of that part of the network is an eligible support activity. The pipes supply gas to the neighbourhood and will remain in place following the test, if they are satisfactory. The salary and materials input into construction of the pipe network should not be eligible for the credit when they are incurred, but depreciation on them should be eligible while they are used in R&D. If, as a result of the testing, the asset is shown to be a failure and written off, the credit would apply to the balance of the construction costs. We have discussed these proposed rules with the Corporate Taxpayers Group which agrees that the treatment in each case seems correct. However, both officials and the Group consider that the rules should be reviewed at an early stage to determine how appropriate they prove to be in practice. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part and the R&D provisions be redrafted to clarify that capital expenditure is eligible to the extent discussed above. 14 Issue: Non-deductible expenditure Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Expenditure that is not deductible – that is, “black-hole expenditure” – should still be eligible for the R&D tax credit in the year the expenditure is incurred. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment “Black-hole” expenditure is expenditure that is not deductible for tax, either when it is incurred, or over the life of an asset. In the R&D context, it exists when expenditure that is capitalised for accounting purposes does not lead to a depreciable asset. There are three circumstances in which this can occur: when capitalised R&D expenditure does not result in an asset at all because the R&D project is abandoned, when R&D expenditure creates an intangible asset that is not depreciable, and pre-business expenditure. Under the bill, to be eligible for the credit, R&D expenditure must be deductible or amortisable. Therefore, black-hole expenditure is not eligible. Submissions argue that there is no sound policy reason for denying access to the tax credit for otherwise eligible expenditure because it is “black-hole”. It is argued that the fiscal risk of allowing the tax credit for black-hole expenditure would be properly managed by careful application of the eligibility criteria. In general, the requirement that expenditure be deductible is a key element in reducing the fiscal risk associated with the tax credit because it provides a link with the income-earning process and excludes expenditure on hobbies, capital assets such as land that do not depreciate, and GST. We therefore recommend that it be retained. However, we have recommended, in response to the submission considered immediately above, that capital expenditure incurred in seeking to create a depreciable intangible or tangible asset be eligible. If this is accepted, the first type of black-hole expenditure – abandoned R&D – will therefore be eligible. This reduces the amount of black-hole R&D expenditure that will not be eligible for the credit. Black-hole expenditure is already a relatively small percentage of R&D expenditure and the question of its treatment will be considered for inclusion in the government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part as described above and that it be noted that the treatment of black-hole expenditure will be considered for inclusion in the government’s tax policy work programme. 15 Issue: Minimum threshold of expenditure Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clarification is required of the relationship between section LH 2 and subsection LH 2(4), which provides for a $20,000 minimum amount of R&D expenditure to qualify. Subsection (5) should also be clarified. Comment Section LH 2(4) sets out the minimum amount of expenditure or depreciation in a year that is necessary in order to claim the credit in that year. (If the expenditure is contracted out to a listed research provider there is no minimum threshold.) The formula is: $20,000 x No. of days for which a person is eligible in a year No. of days in the year If a person is eligible for the whole year, the threshold is $20,000. If they are eligible for part of the year only, the amount is reduced accordingly. For instance, if they are eligible for half the year, the minimum threshold is $10,000. NZICA incorrectly assumes that the formula targets a different situation. We consider that the provisions are clearly drafted and have advised NZICA of the intention of subsections LH 2(4) and 2(5). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 16 R&D MUST BE ON BEHALF OF CLAIMANT Clause 100 Overview The tax concession has been designed to vest with the party making decisions about what R&D investment should be undertaken. Therefore, when R&D is outsourced the concession should go to the party commissioning the research, and not to someone who performs the R&D on behalf of another person. Section LH 2(2)(b) in the bill sets out the three criteria for determining whether the R&D is being carried out on behalf of the claimant or on behalf of someone else. They are that the claimant: • must control the R&D; and • bear the financial and technical risk of the project; and • own the results of the project. In some cases, even when the R&D activity is carried out in New Zealand, a firm may not be eligible to claim a tax credit for the R&D because it is in substance being carried out on behalf of an ineligible entity. Submissions were received on the individual criteria and also how they apply if parties jointly undertake R&D. Issue: Joint R&D Submissions (7 – Dairy Insight, 19 – Deepwater Group Ltd, 23 – ISI, 48 – Dexcel Ltd, 43 – PGG Wrightson, 40 – NZ Bio, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 95 – New Zealand Law Society) Claimants that share the costs of funding R&D activities should be eligible to claim the tax credit. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) In circumstances where the control, financial and technical risk and ownership of the R&D is divided between more than one eligible person, the eligible persons should be entitled to agree on the party that is eligible for the tax credit, or portions thereof; or, if this is not adopted, that the eligibility criteria be extended to require two of the three criteria to be met. (Dexcel Ltd) R&D is often undertaken through consortia where more than one party has control over the R&D. The tax credit should be available if control of an R&D activity is shared between parties acting in collaboration towards a common goal. (Dairy Insight, Deepwater Group Ltd, ISI, Dexcel Ltd, PGG Wrightson, NZ Bio) 17 Current rules exclude co-operative development. In a co-operative R&D activity each participant should be entitled to a credit based on their contribution. (ISI) It should not be necessary for a claimant to meet all three tests. There are cases in which this requirement means no one will be eligible for the credit. Someone should be able to claim the credit in each case and, if there are multiple parties (say in a joint venture), each party should be able to claim their proportionate share of total costs. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Proposed section LH 2(2)(b) should be amended so that it more clearly allows expenditure financed by a collection of persons to qualify for the R&D tax credit. This could be done by amending the opening words of the paragraph so that it reads “the person, whether alone or jointly with other persons ...”. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment As currently formulated, the three “on-behalf of” criteria (of controlling the activities, owning the results, and bearing the financial and technical risk) must all be met. The submissions point out that this can be problematic when multiple parties carry out R&D activities together. While the collaborative group would meet the tests, the individual parties would not. This appears to be a problem for R&D carried out by unincorporated joint ventures and partnerships. Partnerships are dealt with as a separate issue below. The problem could be addressed by applying the three tests to the joint venture rather than to the individual parties to the venture. As with other claimants, the individual parties in a joint venture can only claim the concession in relation to their own expenditure. Therefore, there does not appear to be a risk that applying the test to the group could result in the concession applying to R&D funded by ineligible parties. A supporting provision will be needed so that if the on-behalf of criteria are met by the unincorporated joint venture then the individual parties to the venture will be taken to have met those criteria in relation to their R&D expenditure. A number of submissions sought clarification in this area. We consider that phrasing the general rule setting out the three criteria to state that the R&D must be on behalf of the claimant and not on behalf of another would add clarity to the rules. The rule applying the criteria to the joint venture would be an exception to the general rule. The Corporate Taxpayers Group made the submission that one party in the jointly conducted R&D activity arrangement should always be able to access the tax concession. It is not a policy intent that all R&D carried out in New Zealand will be eligible for the tax concession. For example, the R&D may be performed on behalf of an ineligible business. Dexel Ltd made the submission that one way to deal with the uncertainty arising from the requirement that all three criteria be met when the R&D is done collaboratively, would be to allow the parties to agree on which one of them should be eligible for the concession. As an alternative, they suggested that meeting two of the three criteria should be sufficient. 18 We do not favour the option of allowing collaborating parties to allocate the concession by agreement between themselves. Doing so would undermine the objective of providing the concession to the party making decisions about what R&D should be undertaken, and to compensate them for creating spill-over benefits that are captured by other firms. Similarly, reformulating the provisions so that any one of the three criteria could be disregarded would have the same effect. For example, if the claimant bore no financial risk, then they are not funding any of the spill-over benefits from the activity that are captured by other firms and therefore do not need to be compensated for them. If the firm does not own the results of the activities it is poorly placed to exploit the results. Lastly, if a firm does not control the R&D activity (for example, determining the direction of the work and making decisions to stop unproductive lines of work) it is unlikely that they are the party making decisions about what R&D should be undertaken. While we do not favour the alternative mechanisms proposed in submissions, the proposed solution should address the concerns underlying those suggestions. Recommendation That submissions to allow the on-behalf of criteria to be applied to collaborations be accepted. That a new provision be included so that if R&D is carried out by an unincorporated joint venture, the on-behalf of criteria should apply to the unincorporated joint venture rather than to the individual parties to the venture. That a supporting provision be included to state that if the on-behalf of criteria are met by the unincorporated joint venture then the parties to the venture will be treated as having met the criteria. That a provision be included to state that the R&D activities must be carried out on behalf of the claimant and not on behalf of someone else. That submissions proposing that: • parties to a collaboration should be able to allocate the concession between themselves; • only two of the three on-behalf of criteria should need to be met; and • parties should not be required to meet all of the on-behalf of criteria be declined. 19 Issue: R&D done in partnership Submissions (NZ Bio, PricewaterhouseCoopers) Where a partnership does R&D, these requirements should be tested at the partnership level and not at the individual partner level. (NZ Bio, PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment A number of eligibility tests are applied to a partnership rather than to the individual partners. While there does not appear to be a problem with applying the on-behalf of criteria to partnerships of eligible partners rather than to the partners, doing so to partnerships with ineligible partners could be problematic. It would not be appropriate to apply the concession to R&D activities largely carried out with funds sourced from an ineligible partner. To do so would undermine the objective of excluding those parties from the tax concession. It would therefore be necessary to separate expenditure sourced from ineligible partners from the general partnership funds. However, financial contributions are fungible, once contributions are made by partners it is not possible to effectively trace those funds to the point they are applied to expenditure. The tracing rules required would also have to take into account the contributions made at other times than at the beginning of the arrangement – partners having different rights, multiple projects or ventures being undertaken (whether R&D activities or unrelated activities) over different periods. This would be extremely complex and would require detailed consideration and consultation before being adopted. For this reason we consider that the on-behalf of criteria could be applied to partnerships rather than to individual partners, except in the case of partnerships that include ineligible partners. Eligible partners in partnerships with ineligible partners would still be able to claim the concession if they could show that that they meet the on-behalf of criteria in their own right. We consider that this treatment be adopted as an interim measure and that the rules relating to R&D activities carried on by partners be reviewed for a future tax bill. The treatment of limited partnerships, for the purpose of the tax concession, will also need to be considered once the Limited Partnerships bill is enacted. Recommendation That the submission to apply the on-behalf of criteria to partnerships rather than the individual partners be accepted in part. The tests should still apply to individual partners if one of the partners is an ineligible entity. 20 Issue: Ownership of results Submissions (7 – Dairy Insight, 43 – PGG Wrightson, 57 – Westpac, 61 – KPMG, 74 – Deloitte, 82 – Fonterra, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The requirement to own the results of the R&D activity needs to be better defined. (Dairy Insight, PGG Wrightson) The requirement that the claimant must “own the results of the R&D activities, if any” should be worded to more closely match the government’s intention, as set out in the Commentary, that it does not require the claimant to own the intellectual property arising out of the project. (Deloitte) Effective commercial ownership or commercialisation rights should be sufficient to constitute ownership of the results. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PGG Wrightson) The requirements for a person claiming the R&D tax credit to have control, risk and ownership should be modified to an effective and commercial ownership requirement consistent with that applied in Australia. If these requirements are to remain, guidelines should clearly set out how Inland Revenue will apply these criteria. (Westpac, KPMG) The credit should be able to be claimed by the person with the effective ownership and ability to commercially exploit the R&D activities. (Fonterra) If a group of companies is eligible to consolidate, the tests of control, risk and ownership should be able to be applied by considering the group as a whole. (Fonterra, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment A number of submissions state that the requirement that the claimant own the project results needs to be better defined and be more in line with commercialisation rights. The Commentary to the bill explained that “ownership of the results” is intended to mean that the claimant must have access to and control over the results. It does not require the claimant to own the intellectual property arising out of the project, or to continue to own the project results, or mean that they cannot share the results. Matters of detail will be dealt with in guidelines. We agree that there are benefits to adopting the Australian administrative test for ownership of results, particularly benefits of comparability. The administrative test as applied in Australia does not require the formal ownership of intellectual property, nor legal ownership of the results. But the ability to exploit the results for gain without further fee or payment is required. This matches the policy objective for the concession in New Zealand. 21 The Australian formulation has advantages over other terms such as “commercialisation rights” because there is a body of understanding about how the Australian test applies, and the introduction of new terms could create uncertainty, even though they may have largely the same results in practice. We do not agree with the submissions that all three criteria should be replaced with a single test of effective and commercial ownership. The requirements to control the R&D activity and to fund the activity would no longer apply and thereby make the criteria less effective in targeting the concession at the party making the R&D investment decision. The suggestion that companies able to consolidate should apply the criteria as a group seems unnecessary because the proposed solution would be expected to apply if the individual parties were able to consolidate. We agree that detailed guidelines will be required in this area. Recommendation That the submission to amend the ownership test to “effectively owns the project results” is accepted. That the submissions to: • replace the on-behalf of criteria with a test of effective and commercial ownership; and • apply the on-behalf of criteria to groups as a whole if they are able to consolidate be declined. Issue: Financial and technical risk Submissions (37 – Zespri, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There are two types of technical risk. It should be clear that the type of technical risk intended is the risk of the technology used in or arising from the R&D activities failing. This is effectively wrapped up in the financial risk component. Comment To be eligible, claimants are required to bear the financial risk and technological risk of undertaking the R&D. 22 The intention of the provision is to target the concession to those bearing the type of technical risk of the technology used in or arising from the R&D activities failing. We agree that this type of technical risk is addressed by the financial risk component and therefore consider that it should be removed from the provision for clarity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Control of R&D activities Submissions (7 – Dairy Insight, 57 – Westpac, 82 – Fonterra, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The control requirement may not be met if R&D is subcontracted. (Westpac, Fonterra, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The government should issue guidance on the meaning of “control”. (Dairy Insight) Comment As outlined in the Commentary on the bill, a person would be taken to have control over the R&D work if they have the ability to choose the project, decide on major changes of direction, stop an unproductive line of research, follow up an unexpected result and end a project. Day-to-day management of the activity is not a requirement. Submissions expressed concern that sufficient control might not be retained in some cases when R&D is subcontracted. What the elements of control involve in each case depends on the circumstances of each case. For example, it should not be fatal to the claim that some “control” decisions were taken jointly, or if they were taken before a project begins. Parties could agree before commencement of the work what R&D work will be undertaken and what criteria should be used to determine whether a line of research is unproductive and should be terminated. The control requirements would also be met for R&D on a “take it or leave it basis” where a major researcher may determine a programme of research and solicit industry participants to fund the work. While the researcher may have independently formulated the programme of R&D and control the day-to-day management of the programme, that control is subject to the agreement entered into by the funders and the researcher. In effect, the funders are exercising their control (albeit jointly) when they choose to participate and enter into the arrangement to fund that programme of work. 23 In practice, this may mean that the funder exercises that control at the beginning of an arrangement and is bound by it for the duration of the work. For example, a provider may only undertake a programme of work if the funder agrees to bind themselves to finance all of the programme. In these situations the funder has not abdicated control, but made its choices in advance in the contract. Even then, the funder should be entitled to check that the programme was being carried out and require the researcher to act according to their agreement. Arguments about the exercise of control at the outset of the project will have less force in situations where the scope of the activities is broad, or if the work involves several related projects over a substantial period of time. It is not possible to provide a legislative solution to address all the permutations of control that might arise. Therefore we consider that further clarifications would be more appropriately provided through guidelines instead of through legislation. Recommendation That the submission to provide further guidance on the meaning of control be accepted. Issue: R&D carried out on behalf of overseas affiliates Submissions (Harris Stratex Networks (NZ) Ltd, 38 – Merck Sharp & Dohme, Westpac, 61 – KPMG, 90 – Proacta Therapeutics Ltd) Clinical trials that are performed on behalf of affiliates overseas as contract R&D should be eligible for the credit. (Merck Sharp & Dohme, Proacta Therapeutics Ltd) The credit should be available for R&D carried out in New Zealand by a New Zealand-based member of a multinational group on behalf of non-resident members of the group. It should not be a requirement that the New Zealand company satisfy these three criteria in such circumstances. (KPMG, Harris Stratex Networks (NZ) Ltd, Westpac) Comment In order to be eligible, R&D must be carried out for a New Zealand business or by a New Zealand business on its own behalf. The rationale for this requirement is to encourage New Zealand firms to invest in R&D, and to secure the spill-over benefits for other New Zealand firms that the outcomes from this R&D may generate. The concession is designed to allow New Zealand firms to capture spill-over benefits that arise in the location that the R&D is carried out and those that result from the proximity to the firm actually making the R&D investment. When R&D is carried out in New Zealand on behalf of a foreign affiliate, New Zealand firms capture fewer of these benefits – missing out on the benefits that would arise at the location of the foreign affiliate. 24 An offshore company can indirectly access the credit if it sets up business in New Zealand and that business undertakes R&D in New Zealand on its own account. In this case, the New Zealand business controls the R&D project, takes the financial risk associated with the project and can exploit the project results. Submissions also stated that recent announcements in Australia, to relax the on-behalf of requirement for Australian-based subsidiaries of multinational companies doing R&D for their foreign members, may cause clinical R&D done on behalf of a foreign affiliate to be relocated to Australia. The amendments apply to the incremental tax concession in Australia which provides 175 percent deductibility for R&D activities in a given year compared with the average of the three years before that year. The amendments do not apply to the base concession of 125 percent deductibility in Australia. We agree that the Australian amendments will provide a limited incentive to move R&D done on behalf of foreign affiliates from New Zealand to Australia. The effect of the amendment sought for the New Zealand rules would provide subsidies out of proportion to the expected subsidy from the amendments announced in Australia. Merck Sharp & Dohme and Proacta Therapeutics Ltd also made the submission that there were indirect benefits from the clinical R&D being carried out in New Zealand, such as benefits to clinical patients and the development of close working relationships with clinical investigators and researchers in various New Zealand research organisations. These types of benefits accrue directly from the type of clinical R&D carried out by the firm. The tax concession provides a broad non- discretionary subsidy and is not designed to take into account relative benefits from different fields of research and development. Discretionary direct grants would be a more appropriate mechanism for delivering concessions if the government wished to provide an incentive targeted at a particular industry type or field of study. Recommendation That the submissions that the tax concession should apply to R&D carried out on behalf of foreign affiliates be declined. 25 DEFINITION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES Clause 100 Issue: Scientific or technological uncertainty Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The term “scientific” should be clarified to reflect a wide meaning. Comment R&D activities are defined as systematic, investigative and experimental activities that seek to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty, or that involve an appreciable element of novelty, and that are carried on for the purposes of acquiring new knowledge or creating new or improved products, processes or services. The reference to “scientific or technological uncertainty” comes from the United Kingdom R&D definition where “science” is defined to be “the systematic study of the nature and behaviour of the physical and material universe”. The definition excludes mathematical advances in and of themselves unless they are advances in representing the nature and behaviour of the physical and material universe. NZICA is concerned that this definition of science is narrower than is intended in New Zealand and might be imported into our R&D definition. It is intended that the word “science” be given its ordinary meaning (a branch of knowledge conducted on objective principles involving the systematised observation of and experiment with phenomena, especially concerned with the material and functions of the physical universe). We do not propose that it be defined. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 26 Issue: Advance in science or technology Submission (Matter raised by officials) The first limb of paragraph (a) of the R&D definition should refer to activities that seek to achieve an advance in science or technology through the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty. Comment The first limb of paragraph (a) of the R&D definition (activities that seek to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty) comes from the United Kingdom R&D definition. The definition there refers to activities that seek to achieve an advance in science or technology through the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty. In drafting the proposed R&D definition, officials considered that it was unnecessary to refer to an advance in science or technology because that was implicit in activities that sought to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty. However, in discussing the application of the definition, we have found it more useful to ask whether there is “an advance in science or technology”. We therefore propose that this be added to the definition. In the United Kingdom, there is debate about whether resolving scientific or technological uncertainty inherently involves making an advance in science or technology and in Canada and Ireland these seem to be treated as separate tests. Although the Canadian R&D definition only refers to scientific or technological advancements, in their software guidelines they require an advancement and resolution of uncertainty. In Ireland, activities are not R&D unless they seek to achieve scientific or technological advancements and involve the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty. Nevertheless, in our view, adding these words would be useful and would not reduce the scope of the definition, but would make it clearer. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 27 Issue: Screen content in the film/television industry Submission (31 – New Zealand Screen Council) The definition should be amended to include content development applicable to the screen sector. Comment The New Zealand Screen Council proposes that the definition of R&D be extended to include developing content, in the form of concepts, formats, screenplays or script outlines, in the film and television industry. They note that each screen production is a new concept and/or needs new content which requires R&D. We do not support such an extension of the definition. R&D tax concessions generally exclude arts-related activities and focus on advances in science and technology, which are more likely to generate spill-over benefits. We know of no other R&D definition used for tax-concession purposes that would include development of screen content. If the definition were to be expanded to include such creative activities, it would be fiscally unsustainable. As the submission acknowledges, the industry is separately funded by government for screen development through New Zealand On Air and the NZ Film Commission (which the submission considers to be inadequate). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Appreciable element of novelty Submissions (57 – Westpac, 61 – KPMG, 84 – New Zealand Chambers of Commerce, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Despite several definitions of terms, it is difficult to predict whether an activity is covered or not. For instance, what is an “appreciable element of novelty” and what activity fails to meet such a threshold? Producing uncertainty in important matters such as tax liability should be avoided. Careful drafting of the legislation is required to provide maximum predictability. (New Zealand Chambers of Commerce) The definition of “novelty” is supported, and the Australian guidelines from which it is drawn should be included as part of Inland Revenue’s guidelines on the R&D provisions. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) 28 R&D tax credits apply beyond “radical” innovation and are intended to apply to incremental innovation. This must be recognised by Inland Revenue in its guidelines. (Westpac, KPMG) Comment The “appreciable element of novelty” limb in the R&D definition comes from the Australian R&D definition. It is also a phrase used in the OECD Frascati Manual which provides guidance on what constitutes R&D for the purpose of surveys on R&D activities. We agree that it is somewhat uncertain, but the intention is that it expands the R&D definition to include new uses of existing technology. The intention is for this term to have the same meaning as in Australia. The Australian R&D Guide notes that the element of novelty must be meaningful or significant. The guidelines in New Zealand will draw upon the Australian guide in explaining the term. The intention is that R&D tax credits apply to incremental development and this will be recognised in guidelines. Recommendation That the submission on drafting be noted and the submission on guidelines be accepted. Issue: Support activities must be “wholly or mainly for” core activities Submission (Matter raised by officials) That activities should be eligible as support activities only if they are wholly or mainly for the purpose of core R&D activities (in addition to the existing requirements that they be required for and integral to core R&D activities). Comment Currently support activities in paragraph (b) of the R&D definition are eligible R&D if they are commensurate with, required for, and integral to the core activities described in paragraph (a) of the definition (that is, systematic, investigative and experimental activities that seek to resolve uncertainty or involve an appreciable element of novelty). Five submissions have argued that the eligibility test for support activities should be relaxed (this submission is addressed next). However we propose that it be tightened. We are particularly concerned about the scope for routine business activities to be reclassified as support R&D. This is of particular concern when the potential fiscal cost of the project is high (such as construction of infrastructure assets with some innovative feature). 29 In order to limit the potential for routine business to be reclassified, we propose that support activities only be eligible when they are wholly or mainly for the purpose of the core R&D activities (as well as required for and integral to the core activities). This would exclude from the R&D credit the following types of activity: • Construction of an asset with an innovative component when the primary purpose of construction is sale of the asset. In Australia, where it is sufficient for the support activities to have a subsidiary purpose of supporting core R&D, the tax concession has been claimed for the construction of boats with an innovative part that are intended for sale. The claimants argue that construction of the boat is required to test the innovative part and is eligible as a support activity. • Construction of an asset with an innovative component when the primary purpose of the construction is to use the asset for commercial purposes. In Australia, the tax concession has been claimed for construction of significant engineering projects that will be used for commercial purposes, on the basis that construction is required to test the innovative component. • Activities carried out simultaneously for routine business purposes and R&D but where the activities are carried out primarily for routine business purposes. This would apply, for example, to data collected by a business primarily for its routine business operations, but used also as an input to R&D. It would also exclude mining carried out primarily for production but also with a subsidiary purpose of supporting core R&D. In Australia, this is an eligible R&D support activity (Industry Research & Development Board v Coal & Allied Operations Pty Ltd \[2000\] FCA 979). This proposal is likely to be opposed by those making submissions because it is tougher than the Australian requirement for support activities to be eligible. However, in principle, the credit should not apply to routine business activities. As the rate and nature of the credit are more generous than in Australia, there is more incentive to reclassify commercial activities as R&D and the higher risk warrants a more cautious approach. It is nevertheless worth noting that in relation to the enhancements to the R&D concession recently introduced in Parliament in Australia, the test for support activities is the same as that proposed in this submission. Recommendation That, in order to be eligible, support activities should be wholly or mainly for the purpose of core R&D activities (in addition to the existing requirements that they be required for and integral to core R&D activities). 30 Issue: Support activities must be “commensurate with” core activities Submissions (16 – NZ Post, 60 – Building Research, 61 – KPMG, 57 – Westpac, 91– New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The definition of “supporting R&D” should be aligned with the Australian definition, by removing the words “commensurate with” from the relevant section. This will ensure that all relevant supporting R&D is eligible. (NZ Post, Building Research, Westpac) The words “commensurate with” and “integral to” should be removed. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, KPMG) Support activities should be recognised in the guidelines to the legislation as being broad in scope. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Paragraph (b) of the R&D definition applies to support activities – that is, activities that do not qualify as “core” R&D activities in paragraph (a) but that support such activities. To qualify, support activities must be “commensurate with, required for and integral to” the core R&D activities. Submissions propose that the “commensurate with” and “integral to” tests be removed because: • “commensurate with” is not used elsewhere in tax legislation, or in Australia, and therefore will create uncertainty and confusion; • “integral to” is an unnecessary addition which could be difficult to apply; and • the tests that must be satisfied for support activities to be eligible are tougher than those in Australia when our R&D provisions should be competitive. The test “commensurate with” is adopted from the Canadian R&D definition and is intended to make it clear that support activities must be only to the extent necessary to support the substantive R&D project. This could impose either a constraint on time or resources. For example, assume a nature reserve designs a predator-proof fence that is core R&D. They need to construct part of the fence to test the effectiveness of the design. Building the fence is likely to be a support activity. If a small enclosure is sufficient to test the design, construction of the whole fence would not be “commensurate with” the needs of the core activity. However, we consider that “commensurate with” would not be required if support activities must be wholly or mainly for the purpose of the core R&D as proposed in the submission above. 31 Support activities still need to be “integral to” core activities. The scheme of the provisions is that support activities that are part of the project are R&D activities while less connected activities, such as cleaning, are not R&D in themselves. These costs are eligible as overheads. In relation to the submission on guidelines, we note that the guidelines should accurately reflect the definition of support activities. Recommendation That the submission to remove the words “commensurate with” be accepted if the previous submission relating to support activities is accepted. That the other submissions be declined. 32 EXCLUSIONS FROM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES Clause 100 Issue: Exclusion of activities from paragraph (a) R&D definition Submissions (61 – KPMG, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Inland Revenue’s guidelines should clearly note that although excluded activities do not qualify as core activities in paragraph (a) of the R&D definition, they may still be support activities within paragraph (b) of the definition. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clarification of the scope of the proposed exclusions will be required in the guidelines. The information in the Commentary on the exclusions should be included in the guidelines. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, KPMG) Comment The list of activities in section LH 5 are excluded only from core R&D activities described in paragraph (a) of the R&D definition and may still be support activities in paragraph (b). This is clear in the legislation and the point will also be made in guidelines. We expect that guidelines will also provide detail in relation to the scope of the exclusions. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Exploring for or producing minerals, petroleum and natural gas Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 49 – Contact Energy, 74 – Deloitte) The exclusion for oil and gas exploration includes “producing” minerals, petroleum, natural gas or geothermal energy. This should be removed. Also, the additional Australian qualification, that the activity is “for the purpose of determining deposits”, should be included. Comment Oil and gas exploration is generally excluded from R&D. It is possible to have R&D in the extractive industries (for example, developing new drilling techniques), but the act of searching for oil and gas in itself is not R&D. 33 Accordingly, section LH 5(1)(a) excludes from paragraph (a) of the definition “prospecting for, exploring for, drilling for, or producing, minerals, petroleum, natural gas, or geothermal energy”. This is also the formulation of the equivalent exclusion in both Canada and Ireland. The equivalent exclusion in Australia and the United Kingdom is narrower. In Australia it is: “Prospecting, exploring or drilling for minerals, petroleum or natural gas for the purpose of discovering deposits, determining more precisely the location of deposits or determining the size or quality of deposits.” Submissions are concerned about the exclusion relating to “producing” petroleum and gas because it could exclude from being eligible production activities undertaken as a necessary part of systematic, investigative and experimental R&D activities. Deloitte notes that development of a low emission petroleum could potentially be excluded. We agree that this may be unduly restrictive and propose that reference to “producing” petroleum be removed. Because we are concerned about recategorisation of exploration activities as R&D we do not support limiting the excluded exploration activities to those with certain listed purposes. The risk is that claimants will argue that exploration activity is conducted for a purpose not listed. (The Commerce Clearing House commentary on the Australian concession notes, in relation to this exclusion, that “practitioners should focus on establishing a core R&D activity which is performed for a purpose other than the three excluded purposes”.) Recommendation That the submission to remove the reference to “producing” petroleum be accepted. That the submission to add the Australian qualifications be declined. Issue: Research in social sciences, arts or humanities Submission (31 – New Zealand Screen Council) Clarification is sought that the exclusion for research in arts does not mean the screen industry would be excluded from the proposed credit. Research carried out for artistic and cultural reasons may have a major economic benefit and should not be excluded from the R&D credit solely on the basis that it is art. (New Zealand Screen Council) Comment Research in arts, humanities and social sciences is routinely excluded from R&D tax concessions which focus on advances in science and technology. The creative industries are separately funded. 34 However, it is possible to have R&D in relation to the screen industry or other arts. If a business is developing an innovative product and the development process satisfies the criteria in the R&D definition, the development is not excluded simply because the product is used in the creative arts. For example, animation software developed for use in the screen industry is not excluded under this paragraph. This will be clarified in guidelines. Recommendation That the submission be declined but that it be clarified in guidelines that the development of products and processes that otherwise satisfy the criteria in the definition of R&D are not excluded simply because they have application in the screen industry or another arts sector. Issue: Pre-production activities Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Under the OECD Frascati Manual, some pre-production activities would be considered either “core” R&D or activities that support core R&D. Activities considered to be core R&D should not be excluded. Comment Paragraph (k) of section LH 5 excludes from core R&D “pre-production activities, such as demonstration of commercial viability, tooling-up and trial runs”. This is in the same terms as the Australian exclusion and is intended to exclude activities that are post R&D but pre-production. NZICA refers to the Frascati Manual, which contains guidance on measuring R&D for survey purposes. It states that pre-production activities may include product or process modification, including further design and engineering, and that some activities, such as tooling up and process development, may contain an appreciable element of R&D. As NZICA notes, they could be eligible as supporting activities. However, NZICA is concerned that they would be excluded as core R&D. Paragraph (k) is intended to clarify the boundary between R&D and pre-production activities. Activities either satisfy the definition of core R&D in paragraph (a) or fall within the exclusion. If activities that satisfy the definition in paragraph (a) arise during a pre-production process, they will be eligible regardless of the exclusion. This will be clarified in guidelines. Recommendation That the submission be noted but no amendment is required to achieve the outcome proposed. 35 ELIGIBLE EXPENDITURE Clause 100 Issue: Apportionment of expenses Submission (48 – Dexcel Ltd, 95 – New Zealand Law Society) While it is agreed that apportionment of expenditure is warranted when costs are only partly incurred on R&D, the Commissioner should issue a public ruling outlining his views on the correct apportionment methodologies for this expenditure, and explain what documentation taxpayers are expected to maintain in support of their apportionment calculations. Comment We agree that the Commissioner should provide clear guidance on what apportionment methodologies are acceptable and what documentation will be required to support that. However, it is envisaged that this will be in guidelines, rather than a public ruling. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in principle, but that acceptable apportionment methodologies be set out in guidelines. Issue: Salaries of employees Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 44 – Fisher & Paykel, 37 – Zespri, 61 – KPMG, 74 – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) All employee remuneration, such as fringe benefits, fringe benefit tax, superannuation contributions, specified superannuation contribution withholding tax, insurances and share-based remuneration, should be eligible. Comment Eligible employee remuneration expenditure includes salary, wages, allowances, bonuses, commissions, extra salary, overtime, holiday pay and long-service pay. We agree that this should be extended to include other elements of an employee’s salary package – provision of fringe benefits, fringe benefit tax, superannuation fund contributions, specified superannuation contribution withholding tax and insurance premiums paid on behalf of an employee. 36 We do not agree that the credit should apply to the value of share options. These are not currently deductible and their tax treatment is under review. Recommendation That the submission be accepted except in relation to share-based remuneration. Issue: Depreciation of tangible assets wholly or mainly used in R&D Submissions (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 37 – Zespri, 44 – Fisher & Paykel, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 61 – KPMG, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Depreciation of assets should be eligible when they are not wholly or mainly used in R&D, but used for some of the time in R&D. A just and reasonable allocation of depreciation should be treated as eligible. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Zespri, Fisher & Paykel, PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) If this is not accepted, clarification is required in relation to the phrase “wholly or mainly”. There is also an inconsistency between this provision and the provision relating to pooled property which refers to “wholly”. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment Depreciable assets that are not wholly or mainly used in R&D are not eligible for the credit. We agree with submissions that this can be harsh and recommend that if an asset is used part of the time for R&D and part of the time for other activities in a year, the credit should apply to that portion of actual use attributable to R&D. For example, if in a year 25 percent of use is for R&D and 75 percent of use is for non- R&D, one-quarter of the annual depreciation on the asset will be eligible. Recommendation That the primary submission be accepted. 37 Issue: Depreciation of tangible assets in a pool Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) It should not be necessary for a pool of assets to be used wholly for conducting R&D activities in order to be eligible. Comment Depreciable assets can be “pooled”, with the pool treated as one asset. Because pooled property is not individually tracked, the requirement that pooled assets attract the credit only if the pool is used wholly for R&D should remain. Corporate Taxpayers Group argues that this is unnecessarily unfair to taxpayers who currently have elected to depreciate assets via the pool method. However, this appears unavoidable. For the same reason, the Australian R&D concession does not apply to pooled property. Where possible, taxpayers should keep assets used solely in R&D in a separate pool. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Eligible overheads Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 74 – Deloitte) The list of eligible overheads should be expanded, consistent with the overheads which may be apportioned to R&D under the Australian rules (although the lists appear similar). Officials should state where they believe there are differences from the Australian rules. Submission (Matters raised by officials) The expenditure in relation to administration, human resources, repairs, maintenance, cleaning and security should be limited to the types of salary expenditure listed in subsection LH 6(1)(a), consumables and payments to independent contractors. Overheads should be eligible only to the extent that they are incurred directly in respect of R&D activities. 38 Comment Section LH 6(1)(e) provides for expenditure on certain listed R&D overheads to be eligible. It covers expenditure relating to administration, personnel, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and security, rates, utilities, insurance and leasing of buildings, plant or equipment when the expenditure is incurred for R&D activities. The Corporate Taxpayers Group wants to ensure that the list is consistent with Australia’s. In Australia, overheads are not listed in legislation but are eligible under the general category of “other expenditure incurred directly in respect of R&D activities”. “Eligible apportionable expenses” are listed in Taxation Ruling IT 2552. The following items are eligible: • Cleaning and security • Consumables • Electricity, gas, water, telecommunications • Insurance premiums relevant to R&D activities • Leasing charges on office equipment • Payroll costs • Postage, printing and stationery • Rates and land taxes • Rent and repairs and maintenance of a building used partly for R&D • Remuneration of support staff that perform some duties connected with eligible R&D activities (typists, supervisors) • Subscriptions to industry associations and for technical journals • Training and recruitment The ruling also lists ineligible items, including: • Company establishment and registration fees • Costs in preparing taxation returns • Depreciation • Directors’ fees • Distribution and selling expenses • Employee benefits such as canteen and recreational facilities • Entertainment expenses • Maintenance of grounds and gardens • Legal expenses not associated with any approved research project • Patents and trademarks • Tender costs. The intention is that the list of overheads in New Zealand is broadly the same as in Australia. Rates, utilities, insurance and leasing costs are specifically listed as eligible overheads in paragraph (e). In relation to other overheads, paragraph (e) lists categories of expenditure – expenditure relating to administration, personnel, repairs, maintenance, cleaning and security. Rather than list in legislation the specific overheads that are not considered to be sufficiently linked to R&D, it is proposed that these be detailed in regulations. A regulation-making power for this purpose is therefore required. 39 We also propose the following modifications to paragraph (e) to increase certainty, or better align the provision with the Australian equivalent. As in Australia, overheads should be eligible only when they are incurred directly in respect of R&D activities. For example, a part of the cleaner’s salary will be eligible if he cleans the R&D laboratory, and a part of the human resource officer’s salary will be eligible if she deals with R&D personnel, but the cleaning of the human resources office is not eligible. Expenditure on “personnel” is intended to refer to the human resources area of a business but may be considered to include employee benefits such as canteen and recreational facilities which are excluded in Australia and should not be eligible. This should be reworded. Expenditure on administration, human resources, repairs, maintenance, cleaning and security should be limited to expenditure on the type of employee remuneration listed in paragraph LH 6(1)(a), payments to contractors and consumables. Restricting employee remuneration to the type listed in paragraph (a) means that expenditure not eligible in relation to R&D staff is also not eligible in relation to other staff. Recommendation That it be noted that the list of eligible overheads is broadly in line with that in Australia but that a regulation-making power be provided to specify the overheads that are ineligible. That the other submissions be accepted. Issue: Scope of exclusion for items processed or transformed Submissions (74 – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The terms “processed” and “transformed” are vague terms which apply to almost every R&D activity. If these terms remain, sufficient guidance should be provided for taxpayers to determine their application to a given situation. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) It is not clear from the provision what is being sold – is it just a prototype or is it all sales of all products in the future? (Deloitte) Comment Section LH 6(1)(g) provides that for items processed or transformed into products in the R&D activities, only the “net” expenditure on the products is eligible – that is, the excess of the expenditure over the sale proceeds or market value of the products. The provision is based on the Australian “feedstock” rules. 40 This provision is intended to apply to the acquisition or manufacture of raw materials or products that are “put through” an R&D process. This will most often be trading stock and would include milk processed into powder in an experimental drying process, sheep shorn or cows milked in an experimental process, timber acquired and cut using a novel technique, trees grown in an experimental plot, and iron ore acquired and processed in an experimental smelter. In line with an Australian interpretative decision recently released, the rule encompasses the manufacture of a product that does not change during the R&D process, or changes in a manner that is not visible. The paragraph is not intended to apply to prototypes and should be reworded to clarify its scope. Sufficient information should also be provided in guidelines for taxpayers to determine its application in a given situation. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted and section LH 6(1)(g) be redrafted to clarify its scope. Submission (Matter raised by officials) Expenditure on items processed or transformed in R&D activities should be excluded, except to the extent provided under section LH 6(1)(g). Comment In relation to items processed or transformed in R&D activities as described above, the intention is that only the net expenditure is eligible. Section LH 6(1)(g) provides for this. However, expenditure in excess of the net may be eligible under other paragraphs in section LH 6(1). To achieve the policy objective, expenditure in excess of the net expenditure on items processed or transformed should specifically be excluded in section LH 6(2). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 41 Issue: Value of items processed or transformed Submission (61 – KPMG, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) When market value is the appropriate measure to net off the costs of items processed or transformed, the legislation or guidelines should provide sufficient guidance to ensure that there is certainty about what form of valuation is required. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, KPMG) Comment NZICA and KPMG are concerned to ensure that there is guidance on the meaning of market value in this context – in particular, the market that is to be referenced. NZICA gives the example of a food product that is not able to be sold in the usual market – should it be valued as animal feed, or can it have a scrap or nil value because it cannot be sold for human consumption? Tax provisions commonly require calculation of market value and we do not recommend special legislative rules in relation to valuation of the items processed. However, we agree there should be guidance on the valuation requirements in guidelines or a determination. We also agree with NZICA that guidance should be provided on the industry sectors or types of R&D that this provision applies to. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and details of the application of the provision and valuation requirements be discussed in guidelines. Issue: Payments to persons conducting R&D Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 37 – Zespri, 74 – Deloitte) It should be clear that the costs of independent contractors, agency workers or temporary staff conducting R&D activities under the supervision of the claimant are eligible. Comment Section LH 6(1)(h) provides that payments to another person for conducting R&D are eligible. It is intended that this include the costs of engaging independent contractors, agency workers or temporary staff to conduct R&D. Since there seems to be doubt on this point, it should be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 42 INELIGIBLE EXPENDITURE Issue: Loss on sale or write-off of depreciable property Submission (37 – Zespri, 74 – Deloitte) Loss on sale or write-off of depreciable property used in R&D should be eligible for the credit. It is accepted that there should also be a claw-back of credits when depreciable assets are sold for more than their tax book value. Comment When a depreciable asset is used in a business, an annual depreciation deduction is allowed in relation to the asset. If the asset is used in R&D, there will also be a tax credit in relation to the annual deduction (apportionment is required when the asset is used for part of the time in R&D). When depreciable assets are sold or written off, there is an adjustment of deductions. If the sale price exceeds the tax book value, the difference is income. If the sale price is less than the tax book value, a further deduction is allowed. To reduce compliance costs, these adjustments are ignored for the purposes of the credit. There is no claw- back of a credit already allowed, and a loss on sale is not eligible for the credit. Generally this approach was supported in submissions on the R&D issues paper, and only two negative submissions have been received on this approach. We therefore recommend retaining it. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Core technology Submissions (85 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 74, Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The costs of acquiring core technology from non-associated persons should be allowed when it is reasonable to consider that the vendor’s costs of creating that technology did not attract the R&D credit in New Zealand. (Deloitte) The acquisition of core technology should be included as an eligible item where R&D assets have been acquired. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) 43 The credit should be available for core technology when there is an arm’s-length payment made to a third party as consideration for conducting R&D activities on behalf of the taxpayer. (Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Comment Core technology is technology that is used as a basis for further R&D and may be intangible or tangible property. Expenditure on acquiring core technology is not eligible because of the potential for fiscal abuse. Firstly, it is difficult to value. In Australia, core technology was originally eligible for the concession but inflated core technology values led to its exclusion. It is now not only ineligible but the ability to deduct it at all for tax is limited. Secondly, if core technology were eligible, it would seem possible, by transferring core technology to an associate, to: • access the credit for R&D carried out before the 2008–09 year; • claim the credit twice for development of the same technology. Deloitte notes that one reason given for excluding core technology is that it may have already attracted the credit. They therefore argue that, where it is reasonable to conclude that the vendor’s costs did not attract the credit, the underlying technology should be eligible. We do not agree with the submission. There are other reasons for excluding core technology which are set out above. NZICA argues that the exclusion of purchased core technology means a business purchasing that technology is penalised relative to a business creating the technology. Officials do not think this is a sufficient reason to provide the credit in relation to core technology purchased by a business. The potential for fiscal abuse discussed earlier arises in relation to technology purchased rather than developed by a business. Also, the creation of that technology would not necessarily attract the credit as the technology may be publicly available. Minter Ellison Rudd Watts is concerned that this restriction will affect arrangements to contract out R&D to a third party, which often provide that the benefit of any core technology developed becomes the property of the person commissioning the R&D. The exclusion for core technology would therefore require apportionment between the services supplied and the rights to core technology obtained under the agreement. The exclusion does not apply in this case – it applies only to core technology that is purchased, leased or licensed from another party. In this case, under the contract, the core technology is always owned by the person commissioning the R&D and is not purchased or leased from the party performing the R&D. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 44 Issue: Expenditure met from funds that are required co-funding Submissions (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 44 – Fisher & Paykel, 48 – Dexcel Ltd, 40 – NZ Bio, 61 – KPMG, 76 – Genesis, 79 – Association of Crown Research Institutes, 82 – Fonterra) Expenditure that is met from required co-funding should be eligible for the credit. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Dexcel Ltd, NZ Bio, KPMG, Genesis, Association of Crown Research Institutes, Fonterra) If the submission above is not accepted, rules that are more closely aligned to Australia’s, where ineligible expenditure is twice the amount of a grant, should be considered. (Dexcel Ltd, KPMG, Association of Crown Research Institutes) The tax credit should apply to all R&D expenditure. That would match accounting practice. (Genesis) If the first submission is not accepted, the link between grant funding and ineligibility of expenditure should be more clearly defined. (Dexcel Ltd, Association of Crown Research Institutes) The rules should be more closely aligned with those in Australia. (Fisher & Paykel) Comment The bill provides that expenditure funded from a government or local authority grant or any required co-funding is ineligible for the credit. Submissions agreed that expenditure funded by a grant should not be eligible for the tax credit. However, there was less support for making expenditure met by funds that are required as a condition of the grant ineligible for the tax concession (the “co-funding rule”). The rationale for providing government subsidies for R&D activities is to compensate firms for benefits that accrue to society (spill-over benefits) rather than to the firms. Generally, firms are unable to capture all the benefits of the R&D that they undertake. Providing both forms of subsidies for the same R&D activity would therefore be a double subsidy. Ideally, all other costs of the R&D project should not be eligible for the concession. The conditional funds requirement in the bill was adopted as a proxy for all other costs of the R&D project because of potential problems with defining the scope of R&D projects. Some submissions stated that the co-funding rule was contrary to the objective of providing a tax concession to increase R&D. We agree that the availability of both subsidies would create further incentives for recipient firms to increase R&D activity. However, grants are set at a level that is intended to compensate firms for the externalities generated by the R&D and access to the tax credit for the same R&D activity would be a double subsidisation. 45 Similarly, the argument that the restriction is disproportionate when the required co- funding is larger than the government-funded grant does not seem to take into account the fact that the value of the grant should already be aimed at offsetting likely externalities. This may appear inequitable for large projects which receive a small grant, but there is no economic rationale for further subsidies. Some submissions claimed that the co-funding rule would lead to non-collaborative behaviour. We agree that there could be an incentive to divide previously collaborative R&D projects into components, some of which will receive a grant and some of which will not, but will instead attract the tax concession. This may reduce the collaborative nature of the R&D activity if the sub-projects are carried out in isolation. Funding providers will need to take this into account when determining whether their objectives for providing a grant will be met. Submissions suggested that a suitable alternative to the co-funding rule is alignment with the Australian rules. Those rules require double the amount of the grant to be deducted from particular types of expenditure with the claw-back being applied on a project basis. While there would be benefits from comparability if the Australian rules were adopted here, we do not consider that the policy objective of avoiding double funding would be met. The claw-back applies to ineligible expenditure first and then eligible expenditure and therefore is not an effective way of preventing double subsidisation. Disallowing double the value of the grant seems an arbitrary measure. In addition, those rules require the claw-back to apply to the R&D project in relation to which the grant was provided. Problems with defining the scope of the project were the reason why the exclusion in the bill does not apply to project costs. While the co-funding rule will be more restrictive than the comparable Australian rules, other features of the concession such as wider eligibility and the rate of the concession still makes the New Zealand concession more favourable than Australia’s. Other suggestions, such as limiting the prohibition to the value of the grant would not meet the policy objectives of preventing double funding. Dexel made the submission that co-funding requirements could be met with in-kind payments and arrangements with the funding provider that may not match expenditure requirements in the tax rules. How the rules will apply, to determine what a condition of the grant is, will depend on the particular facts of the grant agreement. It may be necessary to review this provision if it transpires that problems arise. Genesis made a submission that the concession should apply to all non-grant expenditure because it would match accounting treatment of the expenditure. Alignment of the tax concession rules and accounting practice is not a design objective of the concession. Notwithstanding the co-funding rule, there are fundamental differences between accounting practice and the tax concession. This is because the objectives of accounting, to provide a true and fair view of a firm’s financial position and performance, are not the same as those of the tax concession for R&D, which is to provide a sustainable, efficient incentive to increase business R&D. 46 Dexel also pointed out that co-funding could be required for reasons such as determining priority between competing grant applications. We agree that this could happen, and it is likely that there will be some inconsistencies in the treatment of R&D projects simply because of the objectives of funding arrangements. However, despite these problems, a more suitable alternative that efficiently meets the policy objective of preventing double subsidisation has not been identified. The Association of Crown Research Institutes sought clarification on how the exclusion would apply in practice. Examples provided for this purpose have highlighted an area that needs to be clarified. The Commentary to the bill states that the exclusion applies whether the co-funding is required from the person receiving the grant or from another party. The bill does not achieve this objective. We consider that the bill should be amended to reflect the policy. The Association also pointed out there needs to be a clear view of how the exclusion works between funding agencies and tax administrators. Inland Revenue will work with funding agencies to develop clear guidelines for grant recipients. Recommendation That the submissions to remove the co-funding rule be declined. That the submissions to adopt the Australian treatment of grants, and to adopt the accounting treatment of R&D expenditure should be declined. That the co-funding rule be amended to apply when the grant is provided to a party other than the claimant. Issue: R&D conducted overseas as part of a New Zealand-based project Submissions (19 – Deepwater Group Ltd, 37 – Zespri, 43 – PGG Wrightson, 44 – Fisher & Paykel, 61 – KPMG, 74 – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Limiting the credit to 10 percent of R&D done overseas seems harsh. (Deepwater Group Ltd, Fisher & Paykel) The 10 percent cap should be increased to a more realistic percentage level. (Zespri) There should be no cap on expenditure for R&D done overseas. If this is not accepted, claimants should be able to apply to Inland Revenue to receive approval for additional overseas R&D activities to be claimed over and above the 10 percent. (PGG Wrightson) The 10 percent requirement should be relaxed if it can be proved that the R&D activity could not be undertaken in New Zealand, provided the overseas component still forms part of a New Zealand R&D project. (Deloitte) 47 The appropriate expenditure threshold should be 20 percent and/or a discretion should exist to allow a greater than 20 percent (or 10 percent) overseas spend in the case of exceptional circumstances that would justify a higher proportion. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The threshold for R&D expenditure outside New Zealand should be 20 percent. (KPMG) The allowed percentage should apply to the total expected R&D expenditure, or the balance of overseas expenditure unclaimed in a particular income year should be carried forward to future income years. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, KPMG) The definition of “New Zealand” should include the exclusive economic zone outside the continental shelf. (Deepwater Group Ltd) Comment The dual requirements, that the claimant must be in business in New Zealand – that is, they must have an intention to make a pecuniary profit and have a presence in New Zealand – and that the R&D must be done in New Zealand, are aimed at maximising the spill-over benefits that can be captured by the New Zealand economy from the subsidy. Many of the spill-over benefits from R&D tend to accrue to the location in which the R&D is carried out. It is acknowledged that when R&D is carried out overseas there will be some benefits from transferring knowledge back to the New Zealand firms commissioning the work. However, wider benefits – for example, experience that can be applied elsewhere and R&D capability increases, would be expected to accrue to firms at the location in which the R&D was carried out. This is likely to be particularly the case for R&D that has to be carried out overseas to meet specific market or resource conditions. As identified in submissions, there are several reasons why New Zealand firms require their R&D to be carried out overseas. Subsidising that R&D would result in increased benefits to those firms and possibly also to the New Zealand economy from those firms using the results to develop or improve products and processes. However it would decrease the efficiency of the concession – its aim to subsidise R&D in situations where the New Zealand economy is best placed to capture the spill-over benefits from that R&D would not be achieved. An exception is made for some R&D carried out overseas – up to 10 percent of the value of eligible R&D expenditure incurred in New Zealand on a New Zealand-based project. Ten percent is also the limit in the Australian tax concession for R&D done outside Australia. 48 Australia recently announced that the incremental component of their tax concession will apply to R&D done in Australia on behalf of foreign affiliates. R&D done in Australia on behalf of a New Zealand affiliate could be eligible for the incremental concession in Australia as well as the tax credit in New Zealand up to the 10 percent limit in New Zealand. Therefore, increasing the 10 percent limit could encourage relocation of R&D activities from New Zealand to Australia up to the new limit in New Zealand. Submissions identified situations when timing differences between R&D expenditure incurred in New Zealand and related overseas R&D expenditure could mean that the 10 percent allowance would not be available to claimants. As currently formulated, the rule is a yearly test requiring the value of the overseas component of the R&D to be compared with the local component on a yearly basis. This rule will create inefficiencies by creating an incentive for claimants to restructure their R&D activities so that they have sufficient local expenditure to cover their overseas expenditure in the year in which the overseas expenditure is incurred. We agree that the rule should be amended so that expenditure incurred locally on the same R&D project before the overseas expenditure was incurred could be used to determine what amount of the overseas R&D expenditure is eligible for the claim. Similarly, if there is an excess of overseas expenditure in any given year it should be possible to carry it forward so that it could be linked to any new local expenditure on the same R&D project and thereby become eligible for a credit in later years. This amendment will require a consequential amendment to the rule that all expenditure must be incurred and be deductible in the year for which a claim is made. The submission to amend the definition of “New Zealand” to include the exclusive economic zone may have some merit. Further consideration is needed to determine the possible effect of such an amendment on other activity that could take place in that zone – for example, mineral exploration activities. Work on this issue could be progressed for a subsequent tax bill. Recommendation That the submissions to increase the 10 percent limit for eligible overseas expenditure or provide a discretion to increase that limit be declined. That the submission to allow overseas R&D expenditure to be matched to local R&D expenditure on the same project incurred either in earlier or subsequent years be accepted. That the submission to change the definition of “New Zealand” to include the exclusive economic zone be noted. 49 Issue: Purchasing, leasing or obtaining a right to use intangible property Submissions (37 – Zespri, 40 – NZ Bio, 65 – NZ Bankers Association, 74 – Deloitte, 85 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) R&D expenditure incurred in acquiring intangible assets should be included in the definition of “eligible expenditure”. (Zespri, NZ Bio, NZ Bankers Association) The exclusion should not apply to the cost of a licence to use third-party software, commonly incurred in an R&D project. (Deloitte) The credit should be available for the acquisition of intellectual property when there is an arm’s-length payment made to a third party as consideration for conducting R&D on behalf of the taxpayer. (Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Comment Section LH 6(2)(o) excludes from eligibility expenditure or an amount of depreciation loss incurred in purchasing, leasing, or obtaining a right to use intangible property. Intangible assets tend to be used in tax avoidance schemes because they can be unique and hard to value. Officials will consider the extent to which they can be eligible following enactment of the bill. Zespri notes that it has neither acquired nor needed to acquire intangible assets in order to conduct R&D but it may at some future date need to and this should be eligible. The Bankers Association considers that excluding intangible assets is not a principled approach. Deloitte argues that the cost of a licence to use third-party software is commonly incurred in an R&D project and this should be eligible. Officials are concerned about the fiscal risk associated with the acquisition of intangibles and consider that a cautious approach is warranted. We therefore do not support allowing this expenditure to be eligible at present. Officials will consider the extent to which it can be eligible following enactment of the bill. The exclusion does not apply in the circumstances discussed by NZ Bio and Minter Ellison Rudd Watts. NZ Bio is concerned that the exclusion renders ineligible the cost of a patent applied for by a person doing R&D to protect the R&D that it is engaged on. The exclusion does not apply to the costs of developing or protecting an intangible asset in the R&D process, but rather to acquisition of an intangible asset from another party. Minter Ellison Rudd Watts is concerned that this restriction will affect arrangements to contract out R&D to a third party. They note that agreements for contracting out R&D will provide that the benefit of any intellectual property developed becomes the property of the person commissioning the R&D. The exclusion of intangible assets purchased would therefore require apportionment between the R&D services supplied and the intellectual property obtained under the agreement. 50 The exclusion does not apply in this case. It applies to intellectual property that is acquired from another party. In this case, under the contract, the intellectual property is always owned by the person commissioning the R&D and is not purchased or leased from another party. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 51 CAP ON INTERNAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT Clause 100 Background Software development is a significant proportion of total R&D, and so any R&D incentive needs to include software. The information, communication and technology software sector accounted for 18.7 percent of New Zealand R&D expenditure in 2004 ($126.6 million). \[Source: Research and Development in New Zealand 2004, Statistics NZ.\] However, software development – particularly development of software for purely internal uses – has been a problematic area for tax authorities administering R&D tax incentives. In Canada, uncertainty about the eligibility of information technology development for R&D tax credits contributed to a backlog of C$5 billion of claims in 1999, including hundreds of millions of dollars worth of claims in each of the finance and telecommunications industries. There was a strong suspicion that claimants who did not undertake software development as part of their core business had reclassified routine internal-use software projects as R&D. In Australia, software not developed for the purpose of sale or licence (internal-use software) has been excluded from eligibility for R&D tax concessions. In practice, however, the “purpose of sale” test has been relatively weak. The courts have held that the purpose only has to be one of the purposes, and need not be the dominant or primary purpose. This has led to high values of claims from industries such as finance and telecommunications which do not undertake software development as their core business, just as in Canada. In 2004–05, the Australian finance, insurance and telecommunications industries claimed tax concessions for A$830 million of eligible R&D expenditure, or 10.6 percent of all eligible R&D expenditure. The problem of reclassification of routine development to R&D, such as noted in Canada, exists because the legislative definition of R&D cannot be made precise enough to exclude all reclassification of routine processes, not normally considered to be R&D according to the ordinary meaning of that phrase, without also excluding genuine (not reclassified) R&D. This is a generic difficulty but applies to a greater extent to software. The definition of R&D in the proposed legislation and the definitions in other jurisdictions draw on concepts developed to identify R&D which leads to tangible results in primary and secondary industries. Those concepts are less well-suited to identifying R&D in software development, particularly in the service sector. In an ideal world, it would have been possible to create a new definition of R&D which took into account the special characteristics of software R&D while still remaining applicable to other R&D. We are not sure that such a definition is possible. Even if it were possible, creating it would have delayed the introduction of the credit. 52 A cap on internal-use software R&D reduces the fiscal risks of reclassification while preserving most of the incentive provided by the tax credit for software developers – as in Australia, companies intending to develop the software mainly for sale would not face any cap, and eligible expenditure is capped only where the main intention is not to sell or license the software. The level of the internal-use cap is $2 million of eligible expenditure per year. Limited consultation before the introduction of the legislation suggested this would allow, for example, large manufacturing companies to claim credits for development of factory automation software, but that it would be substantially less than the total (and potentially re-classifiable) software budgets of large businesses in service industries such as finance, insurance and telecommunications. Issue: Definition of internal software development Submission (57 – Westpac, 74 – Deloitte) Internal software development is defined as developing software “other than with the main purpose of sale, rent, license, hire or lease to two or more persons” who are not associated. The “main” purpose test should be withdrawn so that the provision is the same as in Australia. Comment In Australia, the legislation states that software development is ineligible for an R&D tax concession if the software is not developed with “the purpose of sale”. In Australia “the purpose of sale” is interpreted as any not insubstantial purpose of sale, which greatly reduces the applicability of the restriction. (See, for example, Sree v Industry Research and Development Board \[1999\] 99 ATC 2237). A conscious decision has been made in the design of the New Zealand scheme to avoid the current Australian interpretation. To do otherwise would make the software cap largely ineffective. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 53 Issue: Removal of cap Submission (23 – Investment Savings & Insurance Association, 24 – AMP, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group The $2 million cap on internally generated software R&D should be removed. Comment Removal of the cap would expose the government to significant fiscal risk. There are two reasons, applying in combination, for this risk: • Software budgets are large. In the New Zealand context, oral submissions to the Finance and Expenditure Committee have indicated that the major trading banks undertake approximately $160 million per year of R&D, while ISI members undertake $100 million per year (previous analysis using official data sources had not indicated such significant R&D from these sectors). While not all of the $260 million of R&D is expected to meet the statutory definition of R&D, it is an indication of the likely quantum of claims in the absence of a cap. • There has been some difficulty in applying various definitions of R&D to software. Both Canada and Australia have experienced high-value internal software claims. In Canada in the 1990s, these predominantly seem to have comprised re-classified routine internal-use software projects. A committee of experts set up by Revenue Canada concluded in 1996 that fewer than 10 percent of expenses claimed by financial institutions for software development were eligible, but as late as 2000 financial institutions were still challenging the assessment of rejected claims (Report of the Auditor-General of Canada, April 2000). There were similar problems in the telecommunications sector. These problems indicated that there was no consensus about the way the R&D definition applies to software. Consultation with other jurisdictions shows that certainty about eligibility for the credit is necessary for investment in R&D. In particular, taxpayers require some certainty when making initial investment decisions that the rules will not later change to deny them credits they might have expected. For the reasons outlined above, the removal of the cap would significantly increase the probability of high fiscal costs leading to rule changes at a later date to control those costs, thereby undermining certainty. Australia has attempted to limit claims for internal-use software R&D by statute, and the United States does not allow any claims for internal-use software unless there is a specific exemption in the statute or in regulations (the main exemption in the U.S. allows a credit but requires a higher standard of proof of innovation). There is a Ministerial discretion to allow internal software spending on R&D at levels exceeding the cap in cases where net national benefit can clearly be shown. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 54 Issue: Banking sector doing information technology R&D Submission (57 – Westpac) The banking sector invests heavily in information technology-related R&D activities and should be eligible for the R&D tax credit on an equal basis with all New Zealand businesses. Comment It is acknowledged that the banking sector invests heavily in software development. The New Zealand Bankers Association reported approximately $160 million of R&D expenditure per year when it provided evidence to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on this bill. While not all of that amount is expected to meet the statutory definition of R&D, it is a significant potential claim. The Investment Savings & Insurance Association has reported to the Committee a similarly large R&D expenditure of $100 million per year. Officials note that these amounts are considerably larger than publicly available data previously gathered would imply. For example, the 2006 Statistics NZ Research and Development Survey showed only $98 million of annual R&D expenditure in the “Other services” category, a category which includes the banking, insurance and communications industries. Notwithstanding that some sampling error is expected in such surveys, the wide variability of reported expenditure in software-intensive industries increases our concerns about the difficulty of defining software R&D and the associated fiscal risk, and reinforces the need for a cap to limit that risk. The cap on internal software development is more likely to be a binding cap for large entities which have high software expenditure but do not have a business which involves primarily selling software they develop. Banking entities, on the basis of the most recently reported expenditure levels, are likely to fall into that camp, but so are entities in other industries such as insurance. Companies which are bound by the cap do have the ability to apply for a Ministerial waiver in cases where the net benefits of the R&D for New Zealand can be clearly demonstrated. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 55 Issue: Other options for cap Submissions (16 – NZ Post, 18 – Weta Digital, 23 – Investment Savings & Insurance Association, 25 – Express Couriers Ltd, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 44 – Fisher & Paykel, 54 – ASB Bank, 61 – KPMG, 85 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The amount of the internal software development cap should be increased from $2 million, with the facility for regular review. (NZ Post, Weta Digital, Express Couriers Ltd) NZ Post supports the concept of a cap to avoid abuse. The cap should be increased to at least $5 million. (Fisher & Paykel, KPMG) If a cap is required: • There should be a legislative commitment to review the need for, and level of the cap, at regular intervals. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) • It should apply to each business activity. (Investment Savings & Insurance Association, ASB Bank) • It should be replaced with a variable cap calculated by reference to the size of the corporate group. (Investment Savings & Insurance Association, ASB Bank, Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) • There should be a rolling cap that applies over a three to five-year period. (Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) • A person should be entitled to carry forward any unclaimed balance to future years. (KPMG) Comment The cap exists because the legislative definition of R&D cannot be made precise enough to exclude reclassification of routine in-house software expenditure, not normally considered to be R&D, as R&D. The level of the cap has been set for that reason. Consultation before introduction of the legislation indicated that a minority of software R&D claims would be restricted by a cap of $2 million. We therefore expect that any increase in cap would primarily result in an increased fiscal risk. The cap is not intended to limit the ability to claim tax credits against eligible software R&D expenditure; rather, it is intended to limit the ability to make large claims for R&D tax credits against expenditure which ultimately should not be eligible if R&D could be defined precisely in the software area. The Ministerial discretion is intended to ensure that genuine claims exceeding the $2 million cap still qualify for the credit albeit with some increase in compliance costs. Increasing the cap would allow more R&D to qualify for the tax credit but at the cost of increased reclassification of routine expenditure by other taxpayers up to the increased cap. 56 We agree with the submission that there should be a commitment to review the level of cap and therefore recommend that the threshold be reviewed as part of the evaluation of the R&D tax credit. We consider that part of this review should focus on the nature of R&D software claims just below the $2 million threshold to see to what extent they represent R&D which is not merely reclassified routine development. A level of cap by reference to the income of the company incurring expenditure on software would tend to allow significant claims by the finance, insurance and telecommunications industries, the sectors that most raised concerns in the Australian and Canadian context. A fixed level of cap sets a clear dividing line above which all organisations have to show that there is net national benefit from their expenditure. The cap is imposed on controlled groups at the level of the group, since it would otherwise be easy to create controlled entities to undertake small chunks of software development projects and avoid the cap. The cap applies to an eligible amount within a year and cannot be carried forward if not used. Allowing carry-forward (or carry-back) of the cap would add undesirable complexity to the rules relating to internal software development, and introduce additional fiscal risk. Recommendation That the submissions be declined but that the level of the cap be reviewed as part of the evaluation of the R&D tax credit. Also see the following submission. Issue: Tightening of internal-use software rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) The internal-use software rules should be tightened to ensure they are effective. If the rules are tightened, the cap on internal software development should be increased to $3 million. Comment The internal software development cap is intended to prevent claims of more than $2 million of eligible expenditure for internal-use software R&D. Internal software development is defined as software which is developed “other than with the main purpose of sale, rent, license, hire or lease”. The cap applies to expenditure on internal software development as a core R&D activity, but not as a supporting activity for some other core R&D activity. The purpose of sale needs to be the main purpose. This is a deliberately more rigorous test than in Australia, where “the purpose” of sale means any not insubstantial purpose. 57 Consultation in Australia and with some New Zealand taxpayers with trans-Tasman connections has revealed that in Australia it is rare for restrictions on internal software development to apply. There are two reasons for the limited application of the restrictions. Firstly, taxpayers can implicitly license software which is used internally, to customers, and it seems accepted in Australia that this constitutes a sufficient purpose of sale, rent, license, hire or lease. Secondly, some taxpayers attempt to reclassify R&D which is “core” R&D (subject to the restrictions) as “supporting” R&D (not subject to the restrictions) for another core activity. For example, a taxpayer developing innovative software for a railway switching system might attempt to classify the software development as a supporting activity for the core activity of developing a switching system, even though there is nothing innovative or uncertain about the switching hardware. To do this the taxpayer might attempt, for example, to introduce some (unnecessary) element of innovation into the development of the hardware. The real core activity in this case is clearly the software development, but in some cases the boundaries are not well-defined. Given the similarity between the New Zealand and Australian rules, officials are concerned that the limited scope of the Australian restrictions will be mirrored here. To ensure that the internal software development cap is effective, officials recommend changing the definition of “internal software development”. It should be changed to always include software which is used for the internal administrative functions of the taxpayer or in providing a non-computer service, regardless of any intent to sell (including “sale” by implicit licence). A non-computer service is a service offered by a taxpayer to customers who conduct business with the taxpayer primarily to obtain a service other than a computer service. This is even if the other service is enabled, supported, or facilitated by computer or software technology. This inclusion would apply in addition to the existing purpose of sale test. This addition to the definition is based on a definition of “primarily for internal use” found in the United States regulations relating to tax incentives for software R&D. Example A consulting firm develops a software package to allow customers to search for and view all previous work they have commissioned from the consultant. In the absence of the software cap, expenditure on the software is eligible for the R&D tax credit. The software is developed for use in providing a non-computer service, since customers deal with the consulting firm mainly for its consultancy services. The software development is therefore internal software development, and the cap applies (regardless of any purpose of sale of the software). We also recommend that the internal software development cap apply to both core and supporting R&D activities, rather than just core activities. This would prevent attempts to reclassify core software development activities as supporting activities. 58 Officials acknowledge that if the cap is made to cover supporting as well as core activities, the level of the cap should rise. In this regard, officials also consider that the level of the cap should be raised to $3 million. This is primarily because some software development undertaken as a supporting activity, which would not previously have been subject to the cap, would be subject to the cap under the tighter rules. We note that the effect of the additional restrictions is to make the cap work as intended. However, with the revised cap, there is the possibility that some valuable R&D activities will no longer be eligible to receive the credit. This problem is mitigated somewhat by the Ministerial waiver. It is acknowledged that the cap is a relatively blunt instrument, which does not distinguish between the least and most valuable activities which meet the legislated definition of R&D. Over time, officials will consult with software industry representatives to develop robust guidelines. It is hoped that such consultation will lead to a common understanding – by industry and Inland Revenue – of the applicability of the definition of R&D to software, and this may permit a later review of the need for (or the level of) the cap. Recommendation That the submission to tighten the software cap rules and consequently increase the cap to $3 million be accepted. That it be noted that making the cap work effectively might – to the extent the Ministerial waiver is not sought or obtained – reduce the credit paid for some valuable R&D as well as reduce the fiscal risk associated with credits for the development of internal-use software. Issue: Development of software as part of a hardware product (firmware) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Where software is developed as an integral part of a hardware product which the taxpayer is developing mainly for sale, it should not be subject to the internal software development cap. Comment We recommend that it be clarified that the internal software development cap does not apply to firmware, such as the software which runs inside a television or washing machine, included in goods developed by the taxpayer mainly for sale. We regard this software as intended for sale. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 59 Issue: Ministerial discretion to waive cap Submissions (16 – NZ Post, 18 – Weta Digital, 23 – Investment Savings & Insurance Association, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 57 – Westpac, 61 – KPMG) The process for Ministerial discretion should be legislated for, providing for the discretion to be exercised prospectively and to include a timeframe within which Ministerial decisions on the lifting of the cap must be made. (NZ Post, KPMG) The criteria for applying the Minister’s discretion should be more definitively legislated for. (NZ Post, Weta Digital, KPMG) The tests for Ministerial approval need to be capable of prospective application to provide certainty. Also the tests should allow for the failure of the project, which is not currently considered. (Weta Digital) There should be clear guidance on the criteria for waiving the threshold. In relation to the test that the claimant has a commitment to retain the value of their business in New Zealand, there should be the presumption that investing $2 million or more on internal software is a high reinvestment by the taxpayer. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The criteria that the Minister can use to allow a greater tax credit claim should be narrowed to bring it in line with the rest of the section – does it benefit the growth of knowledge of the company. (Investment Savings & Insurance Association) A Ministerial discretion should only be retained to the extent that it is required to restrict any actual R&D tax credit concession as it is in Australia. (Westpac) Comment The R&D to which the credit applies is expected to generate externalities (benefits which spill-over from the firm undertaking the R&D to other firms or consumers) as well as direct benefits for the firms undertaking the R&D. In general, the requirement for these wider benefits is not explicit in the legislation, because showing their existence can be difficult and imposes a compliance cost. However, for internal-use software development, and when eligible expenditure exceeds the cap, wider benefits must be demonstrated. This is because internal-use software is a high-risk area in terms of potential fiscal cost and reclassification of routine development as R&D. The criteria in the national benefit test are derived from criteria in the R&D tax incentive in Australia, export market development grants in Australia and market development grants in New Zealand. The test is intended to be flexible, since net national benefit has many facets, and is therefore not prescriptive. Some guidance about the sorts of matters the Minister could consider when making a decision is provided in the Commentary on the bill. Therefore, officials do not agree that prescriptive conditions for applying the waiver should be included in the legislation. 60 We agree with the submissions that prospective applications should be allowed to provide as much certainty to taxpayers as possible. We therefore recommend that the legislation be amended to provide clearly that applications for the Ministerial discretion to apply can be made in advance of the R&D expenditure being incurred. As a consequence, the legislation will also need to be amended to give the Minister power to impose conditions on the decision (it is normal to impose conditions in Inland Revenue binding rulings, in which case the rulings apply only if those conditions are met). We also agree that the provisions should be clear that the R&D does not have to be successful. Officials consider that in most respects the legislation already recognises that R&D may be unsuccessful. However, section LH 9(15)(b) currently requires that “New Zealand will derive a substantial net benefit from the internal software development”. It should be made clear that the substantial net benefit is the net benefit which is expected if the R&D succeeds, and that the R&D need not succeed. Submissions also raise the idea that the Minister be required to respond to a request for an increase in the cap within a required period of time. However, having a set time after which, officials assume, submitters envision that a non-response by the Minister results in an increase in the cap by default raises the possibility that taxpayers could adopt tactics leading to delays. For example, taxpayers could make less than full disclosure or delay provision of information with the hope of stringing- out the process to the expiry of the set period. Measures to address these concerns would make the rules more complex. Recommendation That the submissions be declined, except that applications for a waiver should be allowed before the R&D expenditure is incurred and that consequently, the Minister be allowed to impose conditions on the waiver. That a waiver by the Minister not require that the R&D be successful. Issue: Grouping requirements for the internal software development cap Submission (16 – NZ Post, 25 – Express Couriers Ltd, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 74 – Deloitte) The grouping requirements for the internal software development cap should be aligned with the definition of a “group of companies” under section IG of the Income Tax Act 2004, requiring commonality of 66 percent. Comment The grouping rules exist to prevent taxpayers establishing legal structures which allow taxpayers to by-pass the $2 million internal software cap. Using the group of companies approach would allow taxpayers to interpose non-company entities, such as trusts and partnerships, which would reduce the effectiveness of the cap. 61 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Minor amendment – purpose of sale of software Submission (Matter raised by officials) It should be clarified that “purpose of sale, rent, license, hire or lease” means purpose of sale, rent, license, hire or lease of the software being developed. Comment The internal software development cap applies when the main purpose of the development of the software is not “sale, rent, license, hire or lease to two or more persons” (see section LH 11). It should be clarified that sale, rent, license, hire or lease means sale, rent, license, hire or lease of the software. It is possible that the purpose of sale or license could otherwise be a purpose of sale of something other than the software. This might allow, for example, point-of-sale software developed by a retailer (with a main purpose of selling products in the store) to satisfy the main purpose test even though the software itself will never be sold. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 62 IMPUTATION Clause 108 and 111 Issue: Partial claw-back of benefit of R&D credit on distribution to shareholder Submissions (37 – Zespri, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 74 – Deloitte, 82 – Fonterra, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amount of the notional imputation credit should be increased as there is still some claw-back of the R&D tax credit when distributions are made to shareholders. (Zespri, Deloitte, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) To ensure there is no claw-back of the R&D tax credit through the imputation system, all companies should be able to distribute the amount of the credit as exempt income. There should also be a credit to the imputation credit account equal to the R&D tax credit. If this is not accepted, the deemed credit to the imputation credit account needs to be increased to reflect that the tax credit, when distributed, will be a taxable distribution. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Any distribution of income by a taxpayer to its owners should be tax-free when it represents an R&D tax credit received. (Fonterra) Comment The economically ideal tax credit mechanism involves providing a tax credit and, at the same time, reducing the deduction for underlying expenditure by the amount of the credit. This is equivalent to the treatment of a grant, and ensures that marginal incentives are correct for taxpayers of all types. In practice, however, reducing the deductibility of eligible expenditure introduces undesirable complexity and so full deductibility is allowed. This leads to a credit which is more generous than the theoretical ideal. For entities with imputation credit accounts or Māori authority credit accounts, a credit to the account is provided which is equal to the amount of tax credit. If the entity distributes all the proceeds of the tax credit, the amount of imputation credit is not quite sufficient to fully impute the distribution and there is partial “claw-back” of the credit in the shareholder’s hands. This claw-back puts a shareholder in the same position as the economically correct position. Furthermore, if some or all of the credit is retained by the company, the extent of claw-back may be reduced. It is acknowledged that the current imputation treatment creates differences between the position of companies, which pay taxable dividends, and partnerships or individuals who receive tax credits directly. 63 However, for two reasons, we do not recommend that the imputation treatment be altered. Firstly, it would move more entities away from the economically correct position, and secondly it would involve significant fiscal cost. We estimate that, relative to a baseline costing, moving to an imputation treatment which eliminates claw-back (for a shareholder with a 33% tax rate) would cost $20 to 30 million in 2008–09, rising to $50 to 70 million by 2012–13. We also do not agree that credits should be able to be passed out to shareholders as exempt income. This would be a significant departure from the existing treatment of distributions from companies, which are typically subject to tax in the recipient’s hands even if fully imputed. Other jurisdictions, such as Australia, do not attach franking credits (their equivalent of imputation credits) to tax incentives at all. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Co-operative companies Submission (22 – Westland Milk Products, 73 – Ravensdowne Fertilizer Co-operative Ltd, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The R&D tax credit provided to co-operative companies will be clawed back on distribution to farmer-shareholders because distributions are by way of rebates and not dividends. The rebate provisions of the Income Tax Act should be amended to provide that a rebate is tax-free if it is a rebate of an R&D tax credit. Comment Our understanding is that the credit does not meet the statutory definition of a rebate for mutual associations (including co-operative companies), so cannot be paid out as a deductible rebate to members. However, for co-operative companies, special “deductible dividend” rules apply and although the tax credit cannot be paid as part of a deductible rebate, it can be paid out as a deductible dividend. Our calculations show that if the amount of tax credit is passed out as a deductible dividend rather than as a normal dividend, the outcome for a shareholder will be the same as for a shareholder in a normal company. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 64 Issue: Date credit arises to imputation credit account for R&D tax credit Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The credit to the imputation credit account should arise on the date the relevant income tax return is filed with Inland Revenue. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment Companies and Māori authorities receiving R&D tax credits also receive corresponding credits to imputation credit accounts or Māori authority credit accounts. The proposed legislation currently deems that the credit arises on the day the income tax return, in which the credit is claimed, is received by the Commissioner. For clarity, the date of filing could be used. However, the Tax Administration Act uses the term “furnished” in relation to returns rather than “filed”. Therefore, we recommend that the credit to the imputation credit account arise when the return is furnished to Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 65 CROWN RESEARCH INSTITUTES, TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS AND DISTRICT HEALTH BOARDS AND THEIR ASSOCIATES Clause 100 Issue: Exclusion of Crown research institutes, tertiary institutions and district health boards Submission (43 – PGG Wrightson, 48 – Dexcel Ltd, 61 – KPMG, 79 – Association of Crown Research Institutes) Crown research institutes, tertiary institutions and district health boards should not be excluded. Comment The aim of the R&D credit is to encourage private-sector firms to increase the amount of R&D they carry out, which in turn should increase productivity in those firms, and other firms who benefit from spill-over effects from the R&D. The tax credit is being targeted specifically at private firms because research indicates that there is a more direct impact on the ability of private firms to absorb external knowledge and innovations when they commission or undertake research themselves rather than when research organisations such as Crown research institutes (CRIs) originate the research. If the government wishes to increase R&D conducted by these types of research entities there are more effective ways to do so than by providing a non-discretionary grant through the tax system. We would, however, expect the tax credit to provide some indirect benefit to these organisations as it may lead to an increase in private firms contracting them to undertake R&D projects on their behalf. (The private firms, as commissioners of the research, would be eligible for the tax credit.) The Association of Crown Research Institutes states that several of the arguments made for excluding CRIs are flawed. It claims that: • it would not be possible for CRIs to claim tax concessions for R&D activities financed from government sources; • CRIs are expected to behave like private-sector businesses so they should have the same incentives as private firms; and • government does not “fund” CRIs. 66 They state that excluding CRIs will distort the way collaborative ventures are set up, and encourage the misconception that CRIs are no more than tightly controlled government laboratories. They point out that allegations that CRIs will become “distracted” are without foundation and do not acknowledge the governance arrangements and business focus of CRIs. While some of the above may be correct, it does not change the key motivation for the tax credit, and hence the reason for excluding CRIs from eligibility – which is to encourage private-sector entities to do more R&D which, in turn, should produce spill-over benefits for other firms. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Associates of Crown research institutes, tertiary institutions and district health boards Submissions (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 37 – Zespri, 43 – PGG Wrightson, 48 – Dexcel Ltd, 61 – KPMG, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 72 – Tait Electronics Ltd, 73 – Ravensdowne Fertilizer Co-operative Ltd, 74 – Deloitte, 76 – Genesis, 79 – Association of Crown Research Institutes, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Associates and subsidiaries of Crown research institutes (CRIs), tertiary institutions and district health boards (DHBs) should not be excluded. (Dexcel, KPMG, Association of Crown Research Institutes) The test of association should be amended to limit the exclusion to persons controlled by CRIs, tertiary institutions and DHBs (or where tainted entities have significant influence or benefit from such persons). (Dexcel Ltd, Ravensdowne Fertilizer Co- operative Ltd) A joint venture that is a partnership between a commercial partner and a CRI, tertiary institution or DHB should be eligible. (PGG Wrightson) The association test in section OD 8(3) is too wide. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Zespri, Deloitte, Ravensdowne Fertilizer Co-operative Ltd, Tait Electronics Ltd, PricewaterhouseCoopers) A more appropriate level of association is set out in section OD 7. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Zespri, Deloitte) The tripartite test in section OD 8(3)(c) should not apply. Under this provision, if person A is associated with person B who is associated with a CRI, then person A becomes associated. (Ravensdowne Fertilizer Co-operative Ltd, Tait Electronics Ltd, Genesis, Association of Crown Research Institutes) 67 Comment The policy to exclude CRIs, tertiary institutions, and DHBs from eligibility for the tax credit would be ineffective if associates of these entities were not excluded. R&D activities, that should not be eligible, could be transferred to an associate who could claim the concession on the activities instead. The alternative tests suggested (firms controlled by CRIs, tertiary institutions and DHBs, or the tests of association in section OD 7) do not provide the necessary protection in the context of a tax concession. Excluding companies controlled by these types of entities would mean firms that are 50 percent owned by one of these entities and 50 percent owned by a private firm would be eligible. Control by the private sector is the required threshold. The tests of association in section OD 7 do not apply to trusts, and therefore if adopted could allow R&D transferred into trusts by the excluded entities to be eligible for the concession. The aim of the concession is to increase the amount of R&D activities carried out by the private sector. The control by CRIs, tertiary institutions and DHBs of subsidiaries characterises those subsidiaries as more like the controlling owner rather than the private sector. The tripartite test in section OD 8(3) means that if firm A is associated with firm B and firm B is associated with firm C, then A and C will also be treated as associated firms. We agree that the tripartite test is too wide in this context and creates unintended consequences. Recommendation That submissions to allow associates of CRIs, tertiary institutions and DHBs to be eligible for the concession be declined. That the submission to substitute the test of association in section OD 7 for the test in section OD 8(3) be declined. That the submission to remove the application of the tripartite test in section OD 8(3)(c) be accepted. Issue: Subsidiaries partly owned by private sector firms Submissions (44 – Fisher & Paykel, 43 – PGG Wrightson, 61 – KPMG, 76 – Genesis, 82 – Fonterra, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Where a CRI or tertiary institution (and their associated parties) have entered into a commercial relationship with a third party, the third party or a joint entity should be able to claim an R&D tax credit. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, KPMG, Genesis, Fonterra) 68 The proportion of an organisation’s eligible R&D expenditure in a joint venture with a CRI, tertiary institution or DHB (or an entity associated with them) should not be tainted. (Fisher & Paykel, PGG Wrightson) Comment The policy to exclude CRIs, tertiary institutions, and DHBs from eligibility for the tax credit would only be effective if incorporated joint ventures were controlled by private sector firms. If the private sector has control there is a disincentive for excluded entities to move R&D activities, that they would normally carry out within their own organisations, into joint venture firms for the purpose of generating a refundable tax credit. Ideally joint venture subsidiaries should be able to access the credit for expenditure financed by the eligible body. However, determining what that contribution is, how it should be apportioned over time and different classes of eligible and non-eligible expenditure would require complex ordering and valuation rules which would produce arbitrary results, high compliance costs and little net value to private firms. The example below illustrates this problem. Instead, a simple approach has been adopted; if a joint venture firm is controlled by private sector firms then the concession will apply to all of its eligible R&D expenditure. Example Firm A and a tertiary institution set up a firm B to undertake a joint R&D venture. Firm A has a 30% share in B and the tertiary institution has a 70% share. Firm A contributes to the venture by transferring intellectual property to firm B. The tertiary institution contributes labour and equipment. Firm B undertakes R&D and funds both eligible and ineligible R&D through borrowed funds. Part-way through the first year of operation the tertiary institution purchases 10% of the shares from firm A. Most of the R&D expenditure is incurred in the first half of the year. In this situation it is not clear how B’s entitlement to tax credits should be calculated. Should it be on the basis of actual contribution by A (A has not directly funded any eligible expenditure), or the proportion of ownership of B by A (taking into account the change in shareholding and the timing of eligible expenditure incurred over the year)? If B is able to claim the concession in relation to A’s ownership, then should those credits be required to be transferred to A or should they reside in B? If they reside in B then some of the value of the credits would be transferred to the tertiary institution. Private firms could access the credit by structuring their arrangements with ineligible entities through unincorporated joint ventures or by contracting the ineligible entity to perform the R&D on their behalf. However this would create costs for both the private firms and the ineligible entities, from the use of inefficient legal structures. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 69 Issue: Partnerships with these entities Submission (Matter raised by officials) The provisions in the bill to limit access to the credit to joint ventures where CRIs, tertiary institutions or DHBs have control should also apply to partnerships with these entities. Comment The control tests used in the bill to prevent firms accessing the credit if they are controlled by these three classes of entities does not apply to partnerships. Therefore it would be possible to circumvent the prohibition by structuring a collaboration through a partnership. If a firm wished to access the concession for R&D carried out by these classes of entities it would either need to contract the entity to do the R&D on the firm’s behalf or enter into an unincorporated joint venture arrangement with the entity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 70 INDUSTRY RESEARCH CO-OPERATIVES Issue: Definition of “industry research co-operative” Submissions (7 – Dairy Insight, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 60 – Building Research, 74 – Deloitte) The definition of an “industry research co-operative” should be extended to include wholly owned group companies of the industry research co-operative. (Dairy Insight) The definition should not require each of the main industry members to contribute to the financing of the R&D activities. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The definition provides that each of the industry members must carry on a business activity in New Zealand. This conflicts with the Commentary, which states that the R&D activities must be undertaken mainly on behalf of New Zealand business. The wording of the bill should be amended to reflect the Commentary. (Deloitte) The wording used in the definition of “industry research co-operative” can be difficult to interpret. It is not clear whether all members must satisfy paragraphs (a) to (c) or whether there must be only a subset of members (being at least 51 percent of total members) which satisfy those paragraphs. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Members should be able to contribute to the financing of the industry research co- operatives both in cash and in kind. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The definition of “industry research co-operatives” should be amended to ensure that Building Research is eligible to claim the R&D credit. (Building Research) Comment Industry research co-operatives are sector-specific organisations, generally in the primary sector, that receive levies or contributions from businesses in those sectors. Amongst other things, research co-operatives may conduct or commission R&D for the benefit of those businesses. They are unlikely to be in business themselves, but R&D they undertake should be eligible for the concession. Therefore, to enable them to claim the concession, they are exempt from the business test. Dairy Insight states that an industry research co-operative may incorporate a wholly owned subsidiary to undertake a specific R&D project. This would be done to manage a commercial risk or to separate a particular project for accountability reasons. Extending the definition of an industry research co-operative to include wholly owned subsidiaries may have some merit, given that they are part of the same economic entity. However, it would create an exception to the general rule that the party commissioning the R&D, rather than the party performing the R&D activity, should be eligible for the credit. The consequences of creating such an exception require further consideration by officials. The result of that further work could be considered for inclusion in a subsequent tax bill. 71 We consider that the definition of “industry research co-operatives” is clear and consistent with the Commentary. The R&D activities must be carried out mainly on behalf of New Zealand firms who would have been able to claim the credit and who have made financial contributions towards the work. The definition does not prohibit the co-operatives from carrying out the R&D on behalf of other parties as well as those New Zealand firms. The submission that the bill should be amended so that contributions could be able to be made in both cash and in kind would introduce additional complexity (requiring the inclusion of valuation rules to support the option). There is no minimum amount that members are required to contribute and therefore any contributions in cash will be sufficient. Therefore we do not consider that an amendment is warranted. Building Research has pointed out that the definition of “industry research co- operative” could be amended to make it clear that they come within the definition. We agree that there is uncertainty about whether levies imposed under the Building Research Levy Act would come within the current wording of draft section LH8(c). Therefore a new limb should be added to the provision to include levies imposed under section 5 of the Building Research Levy Act 1969. Recommendation That the submissions to extend the definition of industry research co-operatives to include wholly owned subsidiaries of the co-operative should be noted. That the general submission to clarify the definition of industry research co-operatives be declined. That the submission to clarify the definition to include persons who receive funds for R&D from levies collected under the Building Research Levy Act 1969 be accepted. Issue: Filing requirements Submission (7 – Dairy Insight) Industry research co-operatives should have the ability to file their tax credit claims quarterly. Comment Taxpayers claim their tax credit in an annual income tax return. Taxpayers with provisional tax liabilities can, in principle, receive the benefits of the credit at each provisional tax payment date because their provisional tax liability will be reduced by the credit. Other taxpayers, including loss-making provisional taxpayers, need to wait until they file their income tax returns. 72 In general, the ability to make more frequent claims would increase fraud risk and impose higher design and administration costs. In this specific case, the submission argues that: • research co-operatives will only receive tax credits after filing an income tax return, because they do not pay significant amounts of tax (and therefore presumably will not have provisional tax liabilities which will be reduced by the credit); and • research co-operatives undertake operations that are at the core of the government’s R&D enhancement strategy. We do not consider that these features apply only to industry research co-operatives or that the submission has made a sufficient case for making an exception for industry research co-operatives. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 73 LISTED RESEARCH PROVIDERS Clause 100 Issue: Requirements to be a listed research provider Submissions (74 – Deloitte, 89 – Waikatolink Ltd, 95 – New Zealand Law Society) The government should provide clear guidance to claimants on the definition and meaning of “capable” as set out in section LH 7(1)(a) of the bill and this definition should be inclusive of those entities that contract for R&D services. (Waikatolink Ltd) The government should clarify that, when it requires that the provider has in New Zealand the facilities needed to carry out the R&D, the phrase “has in New Zealand” includes both the legal title and other enforceable arrangements. (Waikatolink) The legislation does not provide any guidance on where the list will be – generally it is specified that notification must be given in The Gazette. (Deloitte) The Commissioner should be required to maintain an up-to-date and publicly available list of listed research providers and should be required to confirm for any taxpayer whether or not any person is currently a listed research provider. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment An important aspect of the tax concession is to facilitate access by small firms to expert R&D services without creating significant compliance or administrative costs. Therefore an exception to the minimum threshold is provided for claimants who contract a listed research provider to perform R&D activities. We do not support Waikatolink’s submission to extend the scope of the definition of listed research providers. While intermediaries who help firms procure R&D services provide a valuable input, that input is not actually an R&D service and therefore payment to those intermediaries should not have the same treatment as payments to bodies providing R&D services. The rationale for the exception is that the administrative risks associated with small claims based on reclassified expenditure can be mitigated if the R&D is actually performed by an unassociated third party who has a commercial function to provide such services. Although listed research providers may well have to sub-contract part of the research they undertake to carry out, extending the definition to include a body whose function is solely to sub-contract the R&D would not provide those same safeguards against the risk of reclassification. Therefore we do not consider that the word “capable” should be given a wider meaning than a party that actually has the ability to perform the R&D activity. 74 Waikatolink has also sought clarification that the phrase “has in New Zealand” will include legal access to facilities rather than ownership of them. While we consider that the legislation should not be amended to include such a detailed clarification, the guidelines to be prepared by Inland Revenue could address this issue. Requiring the Commissioner to maintain an up-to-date and publicly available list of listed research providers will increase certainty for claimants. This could be done through web-based information services. Claimants are required to file their claims electronically and therefore can be reasonably expected to have access to Inland Revenue’s website. Publication in The Gazette would not be as up-to-date and is therefore not favoured. Similarly, requiring the list to be maintained in a particular publication format may reduce the ability to provide the most accessible and up-to- date format available to claimants. We consider that if the Commissioner is required to maintain an up-to-date list and make it publicly available that a further requirement to confirm for any individual taxpayer that a person is currently a listed research provider is unnecessary. Recommendation That the submissions seeking amendments to the application criteria of listed research providers be declined. That the submissions that the list be maintained in a particular place and that the Commissioner be required to confirm the status of particular persons as listed research providers to any individual taxpayer, be declined. That the submission that the Commissioner be required to maintain an up-to-date and publicly available list of listed research providers be accepted. Issue: Effect of delisting Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The legislation should be amended to allow for grandfathering of a client’s right to an R&D credit in the income year in which a listed research provider is delisted if the taxpayer has adjusted its provisional tax liability in anticipation of receiving a particular level of tax credits. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment The submission has identified a situation where a claimant could incur use-of-money interest because a listed research provider has failed to maintain their listed status. We consider that the problem could be wider than outlined in the submission. For example, a claimant could enter into an agreement with a listed research provider for purchase of R&D services but find that by the time they incur the fee for services that the provider has lost their listed status. In that situation the firm would not be able to 75 claim the concession for that contract (unless they met the minimum threshold in their own right). We therefore consider that claimants who enter into arrangements to purchase R&D services should be able to make a claim in relation to that arrangement even if the provider has lost their listed status as such as long as the provider was a listed research provider at the time the arrangement was entered into. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, to grandfather claims for payments made to listed research providers under an arrangement to provide R&D services, as long as the provider had that status when the arrangement was entered into. Issue: Power not to list and power to delist Submissions (Matter raised by officials) The legislation should be amended to allow the Commissioner not to list an applicant if the Commissioner is satisfied that a person will not meet the requirements of listed research providers. The Commissioner should be required to give notice of the reasons for the decisions not to list or to delist a provider, but those decisions should not be able to be challenged. Comment The Commissioner needs a power to refuse to list vexatious applications or to delist a provider to protect the integrity of the tax system. Similar powers exist in relation to the accreditation of listed PAYE intermediaries. The reasons for the decision to delist or not to list a provider should be provided to the applicant so that they have an opportunity to make remedial measures. Not permitting a right to challenge decisions is required to give claimants certainty of the status of a provider. A protracted dispute over the status of a provider (when a provider has been delisted but has challenged that decision) would create uncertainty for a claimant entering into an arrangement contracting with the provider. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 76 FILING OF TAX CREDIT CLAIMS Clause 158 Issue: Group companies Submissions (16 – NZ Post, 61 – KPMG, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Wholly owned group companies should have the facility to make R&D tax credit claims as a group, to minimise compliance costs. (NZ Post) A group of companies should be able to group its R&D tax credit claim, or this process should at least be consistent with the consolidation process, with only one statement in relation to the R&D tax credits required to be submitted. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, KPMG) Comment The proposed R&D legislation currently provides for group filing in two circumstances. The first of these is when an internal software development group exists, in which case a nominated member of the group must file a single detailed return on behalf of the group (this is filed in addition to each member’s normal income tax return). The second is when a partnership elects to file on behalf of all the partners in the partnership, in relation to the activities undertaken by the partnership. Officials are not averse to the prospect of other groups of companies filing a single detailed credit return. However, because of time constraints we have not yet considered the implications, either in terms of consequential amendments to the legislation or administrative systems design, of extensions to group filing. We therefore propose to consider the implications of group filing in more detail at a later date for possible inclusion in a future bill. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 77 Issue: Date of filing Submission (54 – ASB Bank, 65 – NZ Bankers Association) The Commissioner should be given discretion to negotiate extension of time arrangements with some applicants or classes of applicants in relation to filing the tax credit claim. Comment There are two documents which credit claimants need to provide to Inland Revenue. The first is an income tax return containing the amount of credit claimed and the second is a detailed tax credit return containing, amongst other things, more information about the R&D and related expenditure. The detailed tax credit return is essential to the effective administration of the credit – it will provide important information for audit, evaluation and statistical purposes. The tax credit rules have been deliberately designed so that taxpayers will lose the credit if they do not provide this information in a timely manner. The due date for the detailed tax credit return is, for most taxpayers, the same as the due date for the income tax return. For some taxpayers in partnerships or internal software development groups, the due date for the detailed tax credit return will be later than the due date for the income tax return. We consider this to be reasonable. The credit is designed to provide an incentive for businesses to undertake research and development. If businesses are undertaking R&D in response to the incentive, they will be well aware of what the R&D involves and will have had the opportunity to put in place processes to track relevant expenditure. In such circumstances, it should be relatively straightforward to provide the tax credit claim by the statutory deadline. In addition, to claim the credit on an income tax return with accuracy, taxpayers will have to have done most or all of the work necessary to also prepare the detailed return. However, we do recognise that there can be circumstances which prevent a return being filed on time. Therefore, we recommend changing the proposed legislation to allow an extension of time to file of 30 days. Recommendation That the submission be accepted to the extent that there should be an extension of time to file of 30 days. 78 DETERMINATIONS AND GUIDELINES Clause 166 Issue: Determinations Submissions (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 43 – PGG Wrightson, 61 – KPMG, 82 – Fonterra, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Inland Revenue should advise how taxpayers can seek advice on the eligibility of activities and expenditure for tax credits in the period before individual determinations become available in 2010, given the legislative inability to obtain binding rulings. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) An R&D determination should not be binding on the applicant, and to avoid creating a new regime, the existing binding ruling process should be used. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) An optional pre-approval process should be available for R&D tax credit claims. (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Fonterra) If an optional pre-approval process is not available before the first deadline for lodgement of a statement in relation to R&D credits, then the deadline for a lodgement should be extended to allow eligible persons to evaluate confidently their eligible activities and expenditure. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A private determination in relation to eligibility for the tax credit should be binding from the date of lodgement of the application for the determination in line with the Advance Registration process that applies in Australia. (PGG Wrightson) Comment Inland Revenue’s priority is to ensure that comprehensive guidance is available to enable all businesses to be in the best position to assess their eligibility for the credit. To achieve this Inland Revenue is currently employing specialist staff. Over time Inland Revenue will further develop these guidelines. The current intention is that once the general guidelines are robust, work will focus on developing more specific guidance. For the R&D tax credit rules to work as effectively as possible Inland Revenue needs to focus its resources on outputs which provide greatest certainty to the largest number of taxpayers. There is a significant risk that because resources will be dedicated to providing general guidance of benefit to many businesses, individual determinations will not be available until 2010 (these determinations will serve the same need as an “optional pre-approval process”). 79 Until individual determinations become available, businesses will be encouraged to refer to the available guidance and, if necessary, to seek further assistance from their professional advisor or tax agent to help them determine their eligibility. We consider the current tax process of claimants self-assessing their entitlement, with assistance from guidance material and tax advisors, and filing their claim accordingly most efficient in the early years of the credit. Any subsequent disputes will be dealt with through the normal channel for disputes resolution. See also the later submission (on Reassessments), in which we recommend that during the early period of the credit, when determinations are not yet available, there be some relief from reassessment deadlines. Extending the deadline for lodgement The legislation allows the typical claimant 12 months to lodge their claim. A lengthier period is not desirable and may encourage businesses to seek to “reclassify” expenditure; a process known as “grave-digging”. This has been the experience in other jurisdictions where tax professionals identify unclaimed historical R&D and make claims in return for a percentage of the benefit. There is no benefit from this process by way of increased R&D in the years for which the claim is made. More broadly, given that for a claim to be successful the R&D must be scientific, investigative and experimental, and therefore documented, we consider that sufficient records should be available to support a claim within 12 months after the year in which the expenditure is incurred. Determinations should not be binding on the applicant We agree that private determinations on R&D should not be binding on the applicant. Determinations should follow the existing binding rulings regime The bill provides for a separate R&D determinations process. This reflects the different subject matter of R&D determinations, which are expected to involve matters of fact relating to science and technology, rather than simply the application of tax laws. However, the design of the new determinations regime has significant similarities to the rulings regime and to other determination regimes. Determination to be binding from the date of lodgement of the application It is not desirable that the Commissioner be bound before he has been able to consider the application and the extent to which the proposed R&D activity meets the eligibility requirements of the legislation. Recommendation That the submissions be declined, except the submission that determinations should not be binding on the applicant. 80 Submission (Matter raised by officials) That a decision made about determinations under the draft section 91AAP of the Tax Administration Act 1994 be non-disputable. Comment Subsection 91AAP(7) in clause 166 of the proposed legislation allows taxpayers to dispute or challenge a determination made under subsection 91AAP (determinations about eligibility of activities and expenditure for an R&D tax credit). It is not typical for decisions about rulings or determinations to be disputable. Furthermore, if disputes are possible, they could tie up resources which would be better used, particularly in the early years of the credit, in developing general or industry-specific guidance of benefit to a large number of taxpayers. We therefore recommend that subsection 91AAP(7) be removed and that decisions made about determinations under subsection 91AAP be non-disputable. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Guidelines Submissions (43 – PGG Wrightson, 44 – Fisher & Paykel, 82 – Fonterra) Inland Revenue should work closely with organisations after the legislation is passed to develop simple, fair and clear guidelines around the R&D tax credit to ensure organisations have certainty around eligible and ineligible expenditure. (Fisher & Paykel, Fonterra) Inland Revenue should identify as a matter of urgency the guidelines, fact sheets, case law, Australian Tax Office Rulings and Interpretative Decisions that have been issued that could at least in the short to medium-term be relied on by New Zealand taxpayers. (PGG Wrightson) Comment Inland Revenue intends to have guidance available by 1 April 2008. We are according a high priority to developing industry-wide guidelines, drawing on the experience and materials of other jurisdictions. While Australian interpretative materials have been examined, these could not be relied upon by New Zealand taxpayers as the eligibility requirements of the New Zealand tax credit do not mirror precisely the Australian eligibility requirements. 81 Once the legislation is enacted and the draft guidelines completed, Inland Revenue will undertake external consultation to enable businesses to provide feedback on the draft guidelines and to identify additional issues on which further clarification is required to help businesses determine their eligibility. Inland Revenue expects to work closely with industry groups in the progressive development of additional guidance. While the provision of industry-wide guidance by 1 April 2008 is Inland Revenue’s immediate priority, as part of its ongoing administration of the regime, the Department will progressively update and expand guidance materials in response to specific problems identified by industry on which further clarification is required. This will be done as part of Inland Revenue’s regular relationship management meetings with industry groups and bodies, such as the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants. Recommendation That the submission that Inland Revenue should work closely with the private sector be accepted. That the submission that the Australian guidelines be relied on in the medium term be declined. 82 ADMINISTRATION Clauses 169, 172 Issue: Alternate administrator Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 37 – Zespri, 74 – Deloitte) A government agency, separate from Inland Revenue, should be responsible for the determination of what constitutes R&D, as is the model in Australia. If this is not acceptable, at the very least appropriate centralised specialist staff ought to be employed by Inland Revenue to perform this function. Comment Consideration was given by policy-makers to alternative delivery models, with reference to the arrangements and experience of other jurisdictions. The choice of a tax-administration centred delivery model was influenced by the limited timeframe for implementation of the credit. With a single agency accountable for the administration of the credit regime, delivery risk is reduced. Further, given the inter-dependency between the R&D tax credit and the income tax regime, the choice of a tax-administration centred delivery model will reduce compliance costs for claimants. Dealing with two agencies with split responsibilities would increase compliance costs and, potentially cause delays that create further uncertainty for claimants. Inland Revenue is currently assessing the organisational arrangements that it will need to put in place to ensure that the policy intent is realised. In doing so, Inland Revenue is drawing on the experiences of other jurisdictions in administering their respective R&D tax concessions. Inland Revenue is in the process of identifying the specialist organisational capability that it will need to recruit to administer the credit, supported by specialist advisors. In addition to the in-house capability that it acquires, Inland Revenue will have the ability to engage specialist external advisors to help it assess matters such as the eligibility of R&D activities. Recommendation That the submission that a government agency, separate from Inland Revenue, be responsible for the determination of what constitutes R&D be declined. That the submission about appropriate centralised specialist staff be noted. 83 Issue: Reassessments Submissions (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 61 – KPMG, 74 – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 95 – New Zealand Law Society) The standard reassessment rules should apply to R&D tax credits. If standard reassessment rules do not apply, the same time limit should apply to both the Commissioner and the taxpayer. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, KPMG) Claims made for the first two years of the R&D regime should have a further extended period of 24 months (on top of the 12-month period provided for in the bill) in which to file a notice of proposed adjustment or request an amended assessment. This would enable taxpayers more time to ensure that systems were working correctly. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Some discretion should apply initially to allow taxpayers sufficient time and for sufficient guidance to be provided for the evaluation of R&D activities and expenditure. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clarification is sought on how new sections 68D and 68E, requiring electronic statements to be filed by the due date for filing the income tax return, interface with the rules relating to notices of proposed adjustment. A notice should be able to be filed regardless of the existence and timing of an electronic statement. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) It should be legislatively clarified in section 89DA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that a taxpayer can issue multiple notices of proposed adjustment for a single income tax return given the different response periods applying for general income tax issues (4 months) and R&D issues (12 months). (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The Commissioner should not be limited to a one-year time period for amending assessments for an R&D credit claim. Further, the Commissioner should be able to amend an assessment more than once in respect of an R&D credit claim under section 113. Therefore proposed new sections 108(1B) and 113D of the Tax Administration Act should not be enacted. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The normal tax rules allow a four-month opportunity for a taxpayer to amend a tax return. The taxpayer can also request, for a period of up to four years, that the Commissioner make an amendment, although there is no guarantee that the Commissioner will agree to the request. The R&D tax credit raises particular risks which mean that different time periods for amendment are desirable. 84 On one hand it is acknowledged the R&D tax credit could add uncertainty to the tax return process. For this reason, the standard four months to amend a tax return is felt to be too short a period for the R&D credit and we have allowed a longer 12-month period. On the other hand, overseas experience suggests that tax professionals will devote considerable resources to re-opening past-year tax returns to claim R&D if this is possible. In the overseas experience, tax professionals “mine” past returns for R&D that taxpayers did not know was eligible for a credit, and take a cut of the resulting credit claims. The credit claimed in these cases provides no benefit in the form of increased R&D activity in those years, since the R&D was undertaken without the knowledge it would attract a credit. To prevent such mining of past returns, we have not allowed the taxpayer to request that the Commissioner adjust the amount of credit upwards after the 12-month period has ended (requests for downward adjustments must still be allowed for a full four years so that taxpayers are not forced to incur penalties or use-of-money interest). Both the submissions from NZICA and the Corporate Taxpayers Group request further time to amend claims made due to uncertainty in the first few years of the R&D tax credit. Given the possible lack of access to a determination process until 1 April 2010 we agree with this concern and recommend that the period in which an R&D tax credit statement and the R&D claim in the associated tax return be amended be temporarily extended from one year to two years. We consider the extension should apply to the 2009 and 2010 income years. The Corporate Taxpayers Group asks for legislative clarification that multiple notices of proposed adjustment may be filed under section 89DA of the Tax Administration Act, so that separate notices can be filed for general tax issues (within the four-month period allowed) and R&D tax credit issues (within the 12-month period allowed). Our understanding is that multiple notices may be filed, providing each addresses different issues. We do not consider that the legislation requires clarification. Corporate Taxpayers also has a concern about the situation in which a person initially does not claim tax credits and so does not file a detailed tax-credit return by the due date, but later files a notice of proposed adjustment within the period allowed and claims an R&D credit. Entitlement to a credit is foregone in this case because the detailed credit return is not filed on time. We do not envisage that this circumstance will be common. However, we do recognise that in the early years of the credit there will be uncertainty about the application of the new law, and that this could be aggravated by the unavailability of determinations. This may lead some taxpayers, waiting for more certainty about how the law applies to their particular circumstances, to delay claims. By waiting for more certainty, the risk of over-claiming and incurring interest or penalties is reduced. For this reason, we propose that in the 2008–09 and 2009–10 years there should be an exception to the normal rule. We propose that the date for filing the detailed credit return be extended (but no further than the end of the period for issuing a notice of proposed adjustment in relation to the credit) if the taxpayer has not claimed any R&D tax credit in their income tax return. (If the taxpayer has made a claim in the income tax return, no extension will apply.) 85 The New Zealand Law Society submission states that the Commissioner should be able to amend an assessment more than once for an R&D credit claim under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act, and that section 113D should therefore not be enacted. Section 113 allows the Commissioner to amend tax assessments. The proposed legislation limits the application of section 113 in relation to upward adjustments of R&D tax credits, to a period generally ending one year after the due date for the income tax return. As explained above, this one-year limitation is designed to prevent “grave-digging”. The limitation does not apply in cases in which the taxpayer has issued a notice of proposed adjustment in relation to the tax credit within the one-year period. In such cases, a disputes process is entered into and takes some time to complete. The Commissioner needs the ability to alter the assessment at the end of the process including, possibly, making an upward adjustment, even when this is after the one- year period. However, this raises the possibility of “strategic” notices, in which a notice is issued merely to stop the one-year limitation applying, allowing time for grave-digging and further adjustment of claims during the disputes process. Section 113D prevents such strategic notices, by limiting the amount of credit to the amount claimed in a notice issued during the initial one-year period. The intention is that taxpayers will have the initial period for filing a tax return, plus a further year, to determine their entitlement to a credit, and no longer. Recommendation That the submissions raising the issue of uncertainty in the first few years of the tax credit be accepted in part by allowing, for the 2008–09 and 2009–10 income years: • two years rather than one year for amending R&D tax credit claims; and • an extension to the normal time for filing a detailed credit claim if no credit was claimed in the initial income tax return. That the other submissions be declined. 86 Issue: Penalties and use-of-money interest Submissions (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 95 – New Zealand Law Society) During the initial years of the tax credit there should be legislative relief from penalties for unacceptable interpretation and not taking reasonable care, similar to that being introduced for international financial reporting standards adjustments. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Penalty and interest relief would be appropriate for an initial (at least a two-year) period until taxpayers, advisors and Inland Revenue come to terms with the new rules. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) For income years during which taxpayers have no ability to receive determinations in relation to their R&D credit claims: • the Commissioner should not be able to impose civil penalties when the taxpayer’s ineligible claim is the result of not taking reasonable care or adopting an unacceptable tax position; and • taxpayers should not be subject to any use-of-money interest for the relevant income year, when the invalid claiming of the R&D credit gives rise to an underpayment of income tax. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment It is acknowledged that in the early years of the tax credit there is likely to be a greater level of uncertainty about the application of the law than in later years. However, the unacceptable position penalty naturally reflects that uncertainty, as the standard taxpayers are required to meet is flexible. The obligation on taxpayers is to adopt a tax position that is “about as likely as not to be correct”. Where the law is uncertain, this standard is easier to meet as there is less certainty about the correct answer. Further, Inland Revenue’s focus will not be on application of penalties initially, but on ensuring compliance through education and support. However, without this penalty at least being available there are two risks: • that taxpayers may file clearly ineligible claims with no risk of penalty in the hope that the claim is simply accepted; and • that taxpayers know that they can take aggressive tax positions risk-free and do so. We do not support any variation in the application of the use-of-money interest rules as they are not penal and act only to compensate for the timing benefits of under- or over-paid tax. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 87 Issue: Surplus credits Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section LH 1(6), which provides that the Commissioner must use surplus credits to pay a person’s provisional tax for a subsequent tax year, should be removed as it could defeat the intended purpose of the government in cashing out surplus credits. Comment The R&D tax credits are refundable in cash if they exceed the tax liabilities of the taxpayer. The policy intent is that the credit will first be used to settle other tax liabilities, before any refund is paid. It is not intended that surplus credits be applied to provisional tax payments which are not due at the time any refund is paid out. Recommendation That the submission be noted, and that the wording of the legislation be altered to clarify that surplus credits are used to meet provisional tax liabilities only where those liabilities are due. 88 APPLICATION DATE Clause 100 Issue: Late balance date taxpayers Submissions (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 49 – Contact Energy Ltd, 54 – ASB Bank, 65 – NZ Bankers Association, 74 – Deloitte, 82 – Fonterra) Taxpayers should be able to obtain a tax credit for R&D activities undertaken from the earlier of the commencement of the 2009 income year and 1 April 2008. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Contact Energy Ltd) The application date should be a fixed date of: • either 1 January or 1 April 2008. (ASB Bank, NZ Bankers Association) • 1 April 2008. (Fonterra) • 1 November 2007, or if this is not feasible, 1 January 2008. (Deloitte) Comment The R&D tax credit has been integrated into the tax system and is designed to work on an income-year basis. Providing the tax credit for part of the year would require legislation to provide for part-year claims. While some taxpayers may be willing to bear the associated compliance costs, it would mean that some of the value of the credit is simply wasted on the process of taxpayers claiming the credit. Implicit in the claims is a fairness argument that late balance date taxpayers are “missing out” on tax credits as other taxpayers with early or standard balance dates can make claims before they can. However, an income-year application approach is standard and, in the case of taxpayer unfavourable measures, the opposite situation occurs with late balance date taxpayers benefiting. Continuing the fairness argument, it appears unfair for late balance date taxpayers to benefit from delays in application of unfavourable measures but have specific measures enacted to ensure early benefit in the case of taxpayer-favourable measures. Taxpayers choose non-standard balance dates for commercial reasons, such as minimising compliance costs by aligning balance dates with an overseas parent. This is done with the knowledge that this may result in deferring or accelerating the impact of tax changes. At a practical level, Inland Revenue has designed systems to cope with enquiries and claims on the basis of income-year application, which implies a staged uptake of the credit and no claims relating to the 2007–08 or earlier years. Furthermore, part-year claims would pose verification difficulties for Inland Revenue auditors because taxpayers have incentives to allocate expenditure to the period of the year in which the credit is available. Moving to a fixed application date would entail significant difficulties in administration. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 89 MISCELLANEOUS DRAFTING ISSUES Clause 100 Submissions (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Proposed section LH 2 needs to be amended to remove the inconsistency between references to “tax year” and “income year”. Proposed section LH 3(2) needs to be amended to remove the inconsistency between the reference to “tax year” and the associated cross-reference to “corresponding income year” in section LH 2(2). Comment “Tax year” and “income year” are different concepts. A “tax year” is always 1 April to 31 March and that is the year for which credits are calculated under the scheme of the core provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004. “Income year” is the taxpayers tax accounting year which may end on a date other than 31 March. In section LH 2, eligibility of the claimant should be tested in relation to a period in an income year. This will be clarified. In section LH 3(2), the reference should be to income year rather than tax year. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part and sections LH 2 and LH 3 be clarified as proposed. Issue: Eligible amounts Submissions (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 74 – Deloitte) In section LH 1(1), the use of “a” tax credit indicates there is only one tax credit calculated. Under other provisions it is not clear that there can be multiple “eligible amounts”. (Deloitte) In section LH 2(4) the wording refers to eligible amounts both in the singular and plural. It would be impractical for there to be only one eligible amount, therefore perhaps the legislation should be clearer on this point. (Deloitte) 90 In section LH 3, for clarity, the definition of “eligible amount” in subsection LH 3(2) should define it as being the total of all eligible amounts calculated under section LH 2. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Section LH 9 refers to “an” eligible amount. The $2 million cap could be interpreted as being a total cap for all R&D for a developer not just the internal software development. (Deloitte) Comment In straightforward cases, there will be only one eligible amount. However, in other situations there may be more than one eligible amount (for example, if a taxpayer is eligible for two periods in an income year). The legislation needs to apply in both cases. Section LH 1(1) does not refer to the eligible amount that gives rise to the tax credit for the tax year or to the period in the corresponding income year to which the eligible amount relates. These references should be inserted. Section LH 1 will then more clearly allow for the possibility of multiple eligible amounts for multiple periods in the corresponding income year. Section LH 3(2) should also refer to a period to which the credit relates. We agree that the $2 million cap could be interpreted as being a total cap for all R&D and propose that it be clarified that the cap relates to internal software development only. Recommendation That the submission relating to “eligible amount” be noted and the legislation be clarified as proposed above. That the submission to clarify that the cap apply only to internal software development be accepted. Issue: Expenditure paid to an associate Submission (74 – Deloitte) Section LH 6(2)(c)(i) has a circular reference and the use of the words “does not” in section LH 6(2)(c)(ii) is problematic. The wording in section LH 6(2)(d) could instead be used. Comment We agree that the drafting in section LH 6(2)(c)(i) is circular and that this should be remedied. The use of the words “does not” in section LH 6(2)(c) are intended to refer to third-party transactions and are not problematic. 91 The submission proposes adopting similar wording in paragraph (c) as that used in paragraph (d). However, the provisions are quite different in purpose and therefore this is not appropriate. Paragraph (c) applies when a person performs R&D on behalf of an associate, or supplies property used in R&D to an associate. The associate can claim a credit only in relation to the eligible expenditure of a person. Paragraph (d) provides that property leased from an associate must be at market value. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part and the circularity in section LH 6(2)(c)(i) be removed. Issue: Depreciable property acquired from an associate Submission (74 – Deloitte) Section LH 6(2)(f) seems to duplicate the effect of section EE 33 of the depreciation rules which already limits the cost base of an asset to the purchaser. This provision would mean that any approvals under section EE 33(4)(a)(ii) to increase the cost base are not valid for R&D purposes. It might be simpler if the legislation referred to section EE 33 as if section EE 33(4)((a)(ii) did not exist. Comment Section EE 33 limits the cost base of a depreciable asset purchased from an associate – the cost base of the purchaser cannot exceed the cost of the asset to the vendor. The intention of section LH 6(2)(f) is, for the purposes of the tax credit, to limit the cost base of a depreciable asset purchased from an associate who has used it in R&D. Because there is no claw-back of a tax credit on sale of a depreciable asset, the provision is required to prevent double-dipping of the credit. The section applies where the purchase price is less than the vendor’s cost, so is required in addition to section EE 33. However, it need only apply where the asset is acquired directly or indirectly from an associate who has used it in conducting R&D activities. The section should be redrafted to reflect this. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that section LH 6(2)(f) apply only where the asset is acquired directly or indirectly from an associate who has used it in conducting R&D activities. 92 Issue: Consistency in drafting Submission (95 – New Zealand Law Society) The word “conducted” in paragraph LH 6(2)(j) should be replaced by the word “performed” which is used in paragraph (i). The use of a different word to mean (presumably) the same thing is not desirable. Comment We agree that inconsistency in describing the carrying out of R&D is not desirable, and note that the word “conducting” is used also in several places in section LH 6(1). The same term should be used throughout these provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and in the bill, the same terminology used to refer to the carrying out of R&D. 93 Penalties 95 OVERVIEW The compliance and penalties legislation in the Tax Administration Act 1994 came into effect on 1 April 1997. It was designed to promote effective and fairer enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts by providing better incentives for taxpayers to comply voluntarily with their tax obligations. The discussion document, Tax penalties, tax agents and disclosures, was released in October 2006. It examined the current compliance and penalty rules, and identified several areas where the rules could be clearer, more consistent and better targeted to encourage voluntary compliance. It discussed options for the relaxation of penalties when taxpayers have genuinely and consistently tried to do the right thing. The discussion document also proposed that, in future, before recognising a person as a “tax agent” the Commissioner must be satisfied that doing so is consistent with protecting the integrity of the tax system. In addition, it proposed proceeding with earlier announced measures introducing a limited amnesty for business groups identified by the Commissioner. Most of the amendments in this bill result from the proposals in the discussion document. Submissions on the bill are generally very supportive of the proposals. The main areas of concern are: • The definition of “tax agent”: how the rule would apply to in-house tax advisors and the costs of complying with the proposals. • Late payment penalty notification: that the two-year period should be reduced to one year. • Tax agents and not taking reasonable care: that the proposal should be extended to apply to in-house tax agents; that clarification is needed on how the rule would apply to groups and the need to define “adequate” information. • Unacceptable tax position: that the shortfall penalty should be repealed; a discretion should be introduced for “simple mistakes and clear oversights”, and the amendment should be backdated. • Abusive tax position: that the threshold should not be repealed. • Voluntary disclosures: that the proposal was announced as no penalty being applicable whereas the draft legislation gives a 100 percent reduction of the shortfall penalty and the proposal should apply from an earlier date. Officials note that the proposed amendments to the compliance and penalty rules in this bill are taxpayer-friendly and will assist in the rules being applied more consistently and fairly. 96 THE DEFINTION OF “TAX AGENT” Issue: Professional bodies Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) For organisations with members that have a significant function of giving tax advice or assistance with tax compliance, the regulation of tax agents should be left to the membership body. Comment Officials note that not all tax agents are members of professional organisations. We consider that a more consistent application of the provision will be achieved if the decision to apply it is made by one organisation. As the relevant information on the tax agent will be held by Inland Revenue, the decision should be made by Inland Revenue. It is envisaged that the discretion to not grant or remove tax agent status will be exercised in a small number of cases only. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: In-house tax experts Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 74R – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Corporate groups with in-house tax expertise should be eligible to be a tax agent in their own right under the proposed definition of “tax agent”. Comment The current definition of “tax agent” includes any business in which 10 or more returns of income are prepared. This means, for example, that if a group of companies furnished 10 or more returns of income the group could list as a tax agent. It was not intended that this amendment result in corporate groups not being eligible to list as a tax agent. Officials agree with submissions that the definition of “tax agent” should allow companies with in-house functions to be eligible to list as a tax agent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 97 Issue: Compliance costs Submissions (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 74R – Deloitte, 95 – New Zealand Law Society) The compliance costs of the tax agent provisions are too onerous in comparison to the level of risk posed to the integrity of the tax system. All existing corporate tax agents should have automatic registration (consistent with the proposal in the bill in relation to tax agents who are individuals). A particular concern is that the new information requirements could go as far as requiring the names of: • all staff at non-partnership accounting firms with any involvement in the preparation of tax returns; and • assuming corporate groups remain eligible to be tax agents, all members of an in-house tax team, the finance manager, chief financial officer, chief executive officer and board of directors to the extent to which each is involved in the preparation, review and signing of tax returns. The requirement that details be updated within three months of becoming inaccurate is also excessive and will create unwarranted compliance costs. Comment The tax agent amendments allow Inland Revenue to not grant, or remove tax agency status, when the Commissioner is concerned about the integrity of the tax system. One of the requirements of the amendment is that Inland Revenue is provided with the names of: • each person responsible for the filing of the entity’s tax returns, if the entity is a body corporate; • each shareholder of the entity, if the entity is a closely held company; • each partner in the entity, if the entity is a partnership; • each member of the entity, if the entity is an unincorporated body. The amendment is aimed at ensuring Inland Revenue has the names of the relevant persons and that individuals who pose a risk to the integrity of the tax system cannot hide behind a corporate name. We have tried to keep the compliance costs low, for example, by requiring the names of all partners in a partnership – rather than limiting the request to just the tax partners, which might be more difficult to determine. Officials do not agree that all existing corporate tax agents should automatically be accepted as tax agents under the proposal. We do, however, agree with the submission that the information requirements are much wider than necessary. For corporate groups, we consider that the legislation should require only the names of the tax manager, the chief financial officer, the chief executive officer and the directors. 98 To ensure that the information Inland Revenue has is up to date, the proposal requires that when details change Inland Revenue is advised of the changes within three months. Officials agree with the submissions and recommend that this period be extended to 12 months so the information can be filed with the annual return. If Inland Revenue became aware that the information had not been provided in the required 12-month period, it would request details of the change. The omission on its own would not be grounds for removing tax agency status. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, subject to our earlier comments. Issue: Information requirements Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The bill should be amended so that draft section 34B(4) provides that only information necessary or relevant to the purpose of considering whether to list the applicant as a tax agent should be collected by the Commissioner. Comment Officials disagree. The draft legislation follows the precedent of similar provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994, which require information to be provided to the Commissioner. The words “necessary or relevant” are not used. Also, case law prevents Inland Revenue going on “fishing expeditions”. Inland Revenue can only request information for the purpose of administering the Inland Revenue Acts. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 99 Issue: Key factors Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 95 – New Zealand Law Society) The key factors to be taken into account by the Commissioner in considering whether or not to list a person as a tax agent should be specified in an inclusive but not exhaustive list. Comment The proposed amendment sets out a framework for considering whether to list a person as a tax agent. Operational guidelines will set out the circumstances in which it might be decided not to list a person as a tax agent. Setting out the circumstances in the guidelines rather than the legislation gives the Commissioner more flexibility in applying the rules and also the ability to take into account a wider number of factors. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Operational guidelines Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) While supporting giving the Commissioner discretion to withhold recognition or remove a person as a tax agent to protect the integrity of the tax system, operational guidelines setting out how the discretion might be exercised are of critical importance. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Interested parties, such as NZICA, will be consulted in the development of the guidelines. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 100 Issue: Redundant legislation Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The bill sets out when a person must be listed as a tax agent (section 34B(5)), therefore it is unnecessary to set out when the Commissioner must refuse to list a person as a tax agent (section 34B(7)). Comment The bill sets out the process that will be followed when the Commissioner makes a decision to not list, or remove a person from the list. Therefore officials consider that it is appropriate that both provisions remain in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Time period Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The legislation should provide that, in exceptional circumstances, an agent has more than 30 days to supply the information to allow the Commissioner to review the decision to refuse to list a person as a tax agent. Comment Under the proposals, if the Commissioner makes a decision to not grant, or remove tax agent status, the Commissioner must first notify the person, who then has an opportunity to provide any arguments that should be taken into account in making the final decision. The draft legislation gives the taxpayer 30 days to provide information to the Commissioner, or a shorter period if the Commissioner considers a shorter period is appropriate to protect the integrity of the tax system. The submission suggests that the legislation should allow for longer periods. Officials agree and recommend that the proposal be amended, giving the Commissioner a discretion in setting the time period for the person to provide the information, taking into account the circumstances of the case. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 101 Issue: Drafting clarification Submission (95 – New Zealand Law Society) In proposed section 34B(5), the drafting could be clarified by substituting, in paragraph (a) the words “eligible to be a tax agent” for the words “entitled to make the application”. Comment Officials disagree with the submission. The words “entitled to make the application” have been used here and elsewhere in section 34B because the section applies to persons who are not currently tax agents. If the words “eligible to be a tax agent” were used, the section would also apply to persons who are currently tax agents. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Secrecy provision Submission (91A – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The secrecy clause needs to be redrafted to allow the Commissioner to supply the necessary information to a professional body before making a final decision on delisting or not listing a tax agent, when the basis of the decision relates to the integrity of the tax system. Comment As currently drafted, the information Inland Revenue can disclose to professional bodies when a member of that body poses a risk to the integrity of the tax system is limited to the decision to de-list the person. Officials agree with the submission and propose that the draft legislation be amended to include information “that would be relevant to a decision”. Expanding the information that Inland Revenue can disclose and when it may be disclosed should benefit both the body and Inland Revenue in that relevant information may be shared before a decision is made. As noted earlier, guidelines setting out how the discretion will apply will be prepared. The guidelines will also cover what information will be disclosed to professional bodies and how it will be disclosed. A decision to disclose information to professional bodies will be made at a very senior level within Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 102 EMPLOYER MONTHLY SCHEDULE LATE FILING PENALTY Issue: Grace period Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There should be a period of five working days grace before the proposed warning is given. This would remove the vagaries of the postal system and processing malfunctions. Comment If the legislation were amended to provide a five working day grace period, the effective date for filing returns would move to the end of that period, with both a large consequent fiscal loss and requests for further grace periods. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment should be effective from the date the bill was introduced. This change is taxpayer-friendly and clarifies Inland Revenue’s current practice. Applying the new rules as soon as possible would be better and provide certainty for taxpayers. Comment As currently drafted this proposal applies from 1 April 2008. Officials agree with the submission that the amendment be backdated. The amendment clarifies current practice. Currently, a late filing penalty is not imposed the first time an employer monthly schedule is filed late. Rather, the taxpayer is advised that the schedule is late and warned that subsequent late filing will be penalised. The late filing penalty is payable if a schedule is filed late in the 12 months following the warning. If all schedules are filed on time for a year, the process starts again – that is, if a schedule is late, the taxpayer is warned. 103 If the amendment was passed in its current form, taxpayers who have filed their employer monthly schedules late in the previous year will have their slates wiped clean and will receive a warning notice rather than a penalty. This was not intended; wiping the slate clean results in an inequity for those taxpayers who have filed their employer monthly schedules on time. The amendment was aimed solely at aligning the legislation with Inland Revenue’s current practice. Officials consider that the draft legislation should be clarified, and apply from the introduction of the employer monthly schedule, 1 April 1999. As this amendment reflects Inland Revenue practice, taxpayers will not be disadvantaged if the amendment applies from this date. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part and the amendment apply from 1 April 1999. 104 LATE FILING PENALTIES FOR GST RETURNS Issue: Grace period Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There should be a period of five working days grace before the warning is given. This would remove the vagaries of the postal system and processing malfunctions. Comment If the legislation were amended to provide a five working day grace period, the effective date for filing returns would move to the end of that period, with both a large consequent fiscal loss and requests for further grace periods. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Amount of the penalty Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The penalty should be tied to the return cycle, not the accounting basis. The $50 penalty should apply to registered persons on category A, B and C taxable periods and the $250 penalty to a category D registered person. Comment The discussion document, Tax penalties, tax agents and disclosures, proposed that a $250 penalty be imposed on all late GST returns. As a result of submissions on the discussion document, the proposal was amended to provide two levels of penalty – $50 for smaller taxpayers and $250 for larger taxpayers. Registered persons accounting for GST on a payments basis were seen as a proxy for smaller businesses and those on the invoice basis as a proxy for larger businesses. The threshold under which GST may be accounted for on a payments basis is taxable supplies of less than $1.3 million in a 12-month period. 105 While NZICA’s submission has some merit, officials are concerned that some smaller businesses elect to account for GST on a monthly basis – for example, registered persons starting up their business, importers and exporters. Under the submission’s proposal, these persons would face the higher rate of penalty. For this reason officials disagree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Nil or credit returns Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Any late filing penalties should be reversed if the return, when filed, is a nil return or results in a refund to the registered person. Comment Officials disagree. The GST Act requires that nil and credit returns be filed. To encourage taxpayers to file on time it is appropriate that late filing penalties are imposed. GST returns that result in refunds to registered persons tend to be filed early. Nil returns can arise for a number of reasons – including, for example, that the registered person is undertaking seasonal work, or is winding up their taxable activity. Requiring these returns to be filed better ensures that registered persons with ongoing businesses stay in the system and those ending a business activity do not leave the GST base without first complying with their GST obligations. Currently, when taxpayers fail to file their GST returns, Inland Revenue issues a default assessment. A default assessment is an estimation of tax liability and remains in place until the taxpayer files the return. The default assessment may be an excessive response to non-filing, particularly for those taxpayers with a nil or credit return. Imposing a late filing penalty would be a more appropriate response, with the default assessment reserved for significant or ongoing non-compliance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 106 Issue: Good filing history Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) When a registered person has a good filing history for the earlier of 12 months or six returns, the late filing penalty should not apply. Comment As is currently the practice with late-filed employer monthly schedules, the first time a GST return is filed late a late filing penalty will not be imposed. Rather, the taxpayer will be advised the return is late and warned that subsequent late returns will be penalised. The late filing penalty will be payable if a schedule is filed late in the 12 months following the warning. Officials consider that a 12-month period is more appropriate than a “six returns” period as it is consistent with the period for late-filed employer monthly schedules. It also avoids any potential complications when a taxpayer changes the frequency in which they file GST returns. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Hybrid accounting method Submission (Matter raised by officials) The legislation should set out the amount of the penalty for taxpayers who account for GST on a hybrid basis. Comment The proposed amendment sets out two levels of penalty: for those who account for GST on an invoice basis the late filing penalty will be $250, and for those who account for GST on a payments basis the penalty will be $50. The “hybrid basis” requires a registered person to account for output tax in the same manner as the invoice basis and input tax in the same manner as the payments basis. The proposal should be amended so that the $250 penalty also applies to registered persons who account for GST on a hybrid basis. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 107 LATE PAYMENT PENALTIES Issue: Application to GST Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 95 – New Zealand Law Society, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) In relation to GST, the period in which Inland Revenue will not grant a further warning should be reduced from two years to one year. Or the two-year period should reduce to 12 months to align with the limit for the late filing penalty. Comment The proposal does not apply separately to each type of tax; rather it applies to a taxpayer. Providing a shorter period for GST is therefore not appropriate. The proposal is aimed at ensuring that taxpayers who are usually compliant, but who have inadvertently missed a payment, do not incur late payment penalties. A general reduction from two years to one year would not promote the best balance between not penalising an occasional error and providing the right incentives to comply. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The drafting is difficult to understand without an appreciation of the policy intent behind the provision. The current wording makes it difficult to identify that these sections provide for a warning only and no late payment penalty to apply, if a taxpayer has paid all tax on time in the previous two years. Where possible, such relief should be expressed positively in words that clearly convey the policy. Comment Officials agree. The provisions should be moved to subsection (1) to make the format of the legislation consistent with other penalty provisions. The drafting will also be made clearer. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 108 Issue: Grace period Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A period of five working days grace should be given for the payment before a warning is given of a late payment penalty imposition. Comment The initial late payment penalty is imposed in two stages: • 1 percent the day after the due date; and • 4 percent six days later. The staggering of the penalty is designed to provide an incentive to pay tax on the due date and to not overly penalise taxpayers who are only few days late. As the legislation already provides a much lower rate which, in effect, allows a “grace period”, officials do not agree with the submission. If the legislation were amended to provide a five working day grace period, the effective date for payment would move to the end of that period, with both a large consequent fiscal loss and requests for further grace periods. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application of late payment penalties when liability not identified Submission (61 – KPMG) As currently drafted, it is unclear how the taxpayer will be relieved by way of a notification from the late payment penalties for provisional tax payments as the penalty cannot be assessed until the final tax liability is calculated. Comment As noted earlier, this proposal is aimed at taxpayers who are generally compliant but who inadvertently miss a payment. Officials agree that the legislation is unclear when late payment penalties are imposed some time after the due date – for example, in the case of estimated provisional tax, when the taxpayer’s residual income tax is determined. We consider that the late payment notification should not apply to provisional tax and this will be clarified in the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 109 Issue: Due date for payment of tax Submission (61 – KPMG, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section 142A (which sets a new due date for payment of tax if the Commissioner increases an assessment) should be amended to allow a new due date to be extended by the Commissioner, irrespective of whether a return has been filed. Comment Under section 142A, if the Commissioner increases an assessment (for example, following an audit of the taxpayer), the increased amount of tax and any shortfall penalty has a new due date for payment set. However, if there is no assessment of tax (because the taxpayer did not, or was not required to file a return) and Inland Revenue assesses tax, the increased amount of tax does not have a new due date for payment set. This can result in both late payment penalties and shortfall penalties being imposed. When the taxpayer is not required to file a return (and is not self-assessing a liability, as may be the case with non-resident withholding tax) officials consider that a new due date should able to be set because the imposition of the late payment penalty may result from a technicality in the legislation. When the taxpayer is required to file a return (and self-assess) but fails to do so, a new due date should still be set, with the late filing penalty being the appropriate response. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 110 ASSOCIATED PERSONS Issue: Application date Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment should be effective from 1 April 2003, or at a minimum, 1 April 2006. The proposal is taxpayer-friendly and is clarifying Inland Revenue’s current practice around section 141KB, which provides a Commissioner discretion not to impose a shortfall penalty for an unacceptable tax position in certain circumstances. Comment Officials consider that this amendment neither clarifies current practice nor is it relevant to the application of section 141KB. Inland Revenue’s practice under the current legislation is to allow an offset of tax where the taxable or return periods of the two persons are the same. The proposal removes the requirement for the parties’ periods to be the same. If this proposal were to apply retrospectively, cases that involved an inability to offset between associated persons where shortfall penalties had been imposed since 1 April 2003 or 1 April 2006, would have to be reviewed. Given that the legislation and practice have been sufficiently clear this does not seem justified. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 111 TAX ADVISORS AND THE SHORTFALL PENALTY FOR NOT TAKING REASONABLE CARE Issue: Application to in-house tax advisors Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 54 – ASB, 58 – Trustee Corporations Association of New Zealand, 74R – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Corporates with in-house qualified and dedicated tax groups have a capability at least equivalent to external tax advisors and should be entitled to the equivalent level of automatic relief from penalties. Requiring in-house advisers to obtain advice from external parties to enable the corporate to obtain the presumption of taking reasonable care is an unwarranted compliance cost for corporates. Comment Inland Revenue’s practice is that taxpayers who have used tax advisors are usually considered to have taken reasonable care. There are exceptions – for example, where the taxpayer has not provided all of the necessary information to the tax advisor. Under this amendment the legislation will prescribe this and other limited circumstances in which a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care can be imposed when the taxpayer has used a tax advisor. The amendment does not extend to in-house tax advisors. This is because it is more difficult to objectively determine whether in-house tax advisors have provided completely independent advice. This is not to say that in-house advisors do not in a similar way to external tax advisors perform the role of maintaining voluntary compliance. The amendment does not mean that by using an in-house tax advisor the taxpayer has not taken reasonable care, but rather that if an independent tax advisor is used the taxpayer has clearly demonstrated that they have taken reasonable care. Determining whether a taxpayer who has used an in-house tax advisor has taken reasonable care will depend on the relevant facts and there may be a considerable difference between the role of an in-house tax advisor for a large corporate and an in- house advisor for a smaller business. The in-house tax advisor may have systems in place that demonstrate that the taxpayer is taking reasonable care. This will be determined on a case by case basis. Inland Revenue operational guidelines will address the application of the penalty for not taking reasonable care to the in-house tax advisor situation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 112 Issue: Application to groups Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 74R – Deloitte) The amendment fails to recognise that in many situations the taxpayer relying on the advice from an external tax advisor may not have engaged the tax advisor. For example, an external tax advisor may be engaged by the parent of a group of companies. Comment Officials agree that the amendment should extend to the situation of a tax advisor engaged by the parent of a group of companies and recommend that the bill be amended to reflect this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Level of proof and non-disclosure Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 49 – Contact) The proposal is silent on the level of proof Inland Revenue will require that a tax position has been taken on the basis of an action or advice of a tax advisor. If written advice is provided, will it be necessary for the taxpayer to forfeit the taxpayer’s right to non-disclosure of the tax advice document to benefit from this provision? Comment Under the proposed amendment, if a taxpayer is able to demonstrate that they have used a tax advisor, the taxpayer will be treated as having taken reasonable care. The incidental burdens are no more or less than required for other tax administration purposes. Officials consider that the legislation should not set out the specific requirements necessary to show that the taxpayer has taken reasonable care. To do so may result in further compliance costs for the taxpayer, and the current administrative processes allow the specific circumstances of each case to be taken into account. Officials do not consider that the non-disclosure right should be forfeited as that could undermine the policy intent of the non-disclosure right. This will be dealt with in operational guidelines. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 113 Issue: Meaning of “adequate” Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 74R – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There is a lack of guidance provided in relation to what will constitute “giving adequate information to the tax advisor”. “Adequate” should be defined. Comment There is no definition of “reasonable care” in the Tax Administration Act. Broadly, the standard envisages the effort required being commensurate with a reasonable person’s actions in the taxpayer’s circumstances. The proposed amendment uses “adequate” in two places. A taxpayer who relies on an action or advice of a tax advisor is considered to have taken reasonable care, except if the taxpayer: “(b) does not provide to the tax advisor adequate information relating to the tax position: “(c) does not provide to the tax advisor adequate instructions relating to the tax position:” Officials consider that “adequate” should not be defined as what is considered “adequate” information or instruction will depend on the taxpayer’s circumstances. Officials agree that there is a need for operational guidelines. There are currently operational guidelines – for example, standard practice statements and interpretation statements that relate to the shortfall penalty legislation. These statements will be updated as a result of the amendments in this bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Corresponding tax positions Submissions (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The bill provides that a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care can be imposed, when the taxpayer uses an agent, if the taxpayer has previously had a tax shortfall for the same type of tax arising from a corresponding tax position in an earlier return and does not take reasonable care to avoid the further tax shortfall. There should be a time limit imposed in this context. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) 114 This amendment should be removed and it should be decided on a case by case basis. Taxpayers can easily end up with a tax shortfall for the same types of tax arising from a corresponding tax position, say, through disputes on a technical interpretation basis. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountant) Comment The proposed amendment sets out when a taxpayer who has used an agent may have a penalty for not taking reasonable care imposed. This includes when the taxpayer: “has previously had a tax shortfall for the same type of tax arising from a corresponding tax position in an earlier return and does not take reasonable care to avoid the further tax shortfall” Officials consider that the proposed amendment currently allows for such cases to be considered on a case by case basis. After a tax shortfall is identified, a reasonable person in the taxpayer’s circumstances would identify that there is a risk in that area and would check in future periods that their tax position is correct. Officials agree with the PricewaterhouseCoopers submission. We consider that over time the taxpayer may no longer be aware of the risk and the proposal should be amended to provide for a four-year time limit. Recommendation That the submission for a time limit be accepted in part in that a four-year time period be imposed. That the second submission be declined. 115 REFINING THE SCOPE OF THE UNACCEPTABLE TAX POSITION SHORTFALL PENALTY Issue: The unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty should be repealed Submissions (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The not taking reasonable care shortfall penalty is imposed when a taxpayer has not exercised reasonable care. Where a taxpayer has exercised reasonable care, they should not be subject to an unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The unacceptable tax position should be repealed and replaced by the former “unacceptable interpretation”. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty is intended to ensure that taxpayers who take tax positions where there is a significant amount of tax at stake should take extra care and, when viewed objectively, their tax positions meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. Officials acknowledge that there have been problems in the past with the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty. Last year, as a short-term solution, the Commissioner was given a discretion allowing him to reverse or not impose the penalty if certain criteria were met. The amendments in this bill form the long-term solution – limiting the scope of the penalty to income tax and substantially increasing the threshold at which the penalty is assessed. The amendments to the voluntary disclosure legislation also deal with some of the problems with this penalty. Officials consider that this penalty is necessary to ensure that taxpayer’s tax positions are “about as likely as not to be correct” in terms of the law. As noted in the discussion document, Tax penalties, tax agents and disclosures, the unacceptable tax position penalty: “... can be compared with the shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care, which applies to a more general set of actions. When looking at whether a tax position is acceptable or not, the subjective elements, such as the effort the taxpayer went to, are not considered. In relation to the penalty for not taking reasonable care, taxpayers can argue that reasonable care has been taken by simply using a tax agent. This is not the case with the penalty for an unacceptable tax position – the penalty applies if the tax position taken fails to meet the required standard, irrespective of whether the taxpayer has engaged an agent.” 1 1 Paragraph 4.3 116 In developing the amendments in this bill, the option of returning to the unacceptable interpretation penalty was considered. As noted in the discussion document, the change from unacceptable interpretation to unacceptable tax position was necessary because taxpayers could and did argue that because they had not made an interpretation the shortfall penalty could not be assessed. Officials remain of the view that if the penalty reverted to the unacceptable interpretation standard there would be cases where no shortfall penalty could be assessed, although a penalty would be warranted in the circumstances. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Meaning of “income tax” Submission (34 – Toovey Eaton & Macdonald Limited) The amendment states that a taxpayer may be liable to an unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty in relation to income tax. The term “income tax” is not defined in the Tax Administration Act 1994. The term should be defined to provide clarity that withholding tax-types are not encompassed within this definition. Comment Officials agree. We recommend that section OB 6 of the Income Tax Act 2004 be amended to reflect this and to clarify that withholding-type taxes are excluded from the scope of the penalty. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Simple mistakes and oversights Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The Commissioner should be given a discretion to not impose a shortfall penalty for an unacceptable tax position when a taxpayer has exercised reasonable care but has made a simple mistake or oversight. 117 Comment Officials agree that in many situations tax shortfalls should not be penalised – for a penalty to be imposed, the taxpayer’s actions must fail to meet a required standard. Under the proposed amendment, many of the cases where currently, the application of a shortfall penalty appears unfair will not be penalised. For example, a taxpayer who files a return, quickly realises there is a mistake in the return and contacts Inland Revenue to correct the mistake, will have made a voluntary disclosure and a shortfall penalty will not be assessed. The proposed threshold for the penalty is substantial (more than both $50,000 and 1 percent of the taxpayer’s total tax figure) and by implication covers most instances of clear mistake or simple oversight. Limiting the scope of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty to income tax will also help ensure that penalties are not imposed in most cases. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Level of threshold Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed minimum threshold of $50,000 should be increased to $100,000. The $50,000 limit is easy to breach for large corporate taxpayers and an increase will mean that larger taxpayers are not unfairly treated. Comment The bill proposes the tax shortfall must be both more than $50,000 in tax and 1 percent of the taxpayer’s total tax figure for the relevant return period. Officials consider that the 1 percent threshold already caters for large corporates because it will ensure that the penalty will not apply to what may be considered everyday transactions for those taxpayers. Officials consider that the dollar increase of the threshold in the bill (from $20,000 to $50,000) is already significant and a further increase is unwarranted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 118 Issue: Repeal of the discretion Submission (39 – Owens Tax Advisors Ltd, 74R – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section 141KB of the Tax Administration Act (which gives the Commissioner the discretion not to impose the unacceptable tax position penalty in certain circumstances) should be retained. Comment Section 141KB was enacted in 2006 to deal with concerns with the breadth of the application of the unacceptable tax position penalty. It provides the Commissioner with the discretion either to cancel or not impose the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty. The discretion applies in cases when the Commissioner is satisfied that: • the tax position taken is the result of a clear mistake or simple oversight; • the shortfall arising from the tax position is or would be subject to a reduced penalty because the shortfall was voluntarily disclosed before notification of a pending tax audit or investigation, or is a temporary shortfall; and • it is appropriate that the taxpayer not be liable to pay an unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty in relation to the tax position taken. When introduced, the section was not considered to be a long-term solution to perceived problems in this area because: • it increases administrative and compliance costs; • does not fit well with the self-assessment environment; and • using the words “clear mistake and simple oversight” in the penalties context is inherently uncertain and may create a revenue risk if the term becomes more broadly interpreted over time. The amendments in the bill – namely increasing the thresholds for the application of the penalty and limiting its scope to income tax, will deal with the vast majority of concerns with its application, including the concerns intended to be addressed by section 141KB. The voluntary disclosure proposal will also help deal with other concerns. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 119 Issue: Application date Submission (39 – Owens Tax Advisors Ltd, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposal should be backdated to 1 April 2003, the introduction of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty, or at a minimum 1 April 2006. Comment As noted earlier, an amendment was made last year, as a short-term measure, to deal with concerns about the breadth of application of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty. In developing the discretion (the short-term solution) it was considered that if the penalty was reversed or not imposed, Inland Revenue should then be able to consider whether the taxpayer had taken reasonable care. Whether reasonable care has been taken is determined on a case by case basis. The amendments to the unacceptable tax position penalty in the bill have not been made retrospective because the discretion enacted in 2006 (and repealed in this bill) was backdated to 1 April 2003 and therefore effectively dealt with cases where the imposition of that penalty was seen as unfair. Cases where the Commissioner applied the discretion but which remained subject to a shortfall penalty were those to which the not taking reasonable care penalty could be applied. The proposed amendments are not intended to substantially change the application of this penalty and making the amendments to the unacceptable tax position penalty retrospective would not alter this position. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Calculation and recording of numbers Submission (Matter raised by officials) The exclusion from the unacceptable tax position penalty for tax shortfalls arising from mistakes in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return should be clarified to apply to working papers. 120 Comment Currently, if a tax shortfall arises “merely by making a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return”, the taxpayer is treated as not having taken an unacceptable tax position. Officials consider that the legislation should be clarified to also apply to working papers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 121 ABUSIVE TAX POSITION SHORTFALL PENALTY THRESHOLD Issue: The threshold should not be removed Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The current threshold for the imposition of the shortfall penalty for an abusive tax position should not be repealed and the threshold should be at the same level as that for an unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty. Comment An abusive tax position is an unacceptable tax position (a tax position that is not “about as likely as not to be correct”) that has a dominant purpose of reducing or removing tax liabilities or giving tax benefits. As noted in the discussion document, Tax penalties, tax agents and disclosures: “While it is appropriate that the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty has a threshold, as it would be overly onerous to apply this standard to all tax positions, this does not hold true for abusive tax positions. Although an abusive tax position is an unacceptable tax position, it is also at the more aggressive end of the non-compliance scale.” 2 The bill increases the threshold for the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty from $20,000 to $50,000. Officials do not consider that it is appropriate for tax positions at the more aggressive end of the compliance scale, that fall below either $20,000 or $50,000, not to face shortfall penalties. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 2 Paragraph 7.4 122 LATE PAYMENT OF PAYE Issue: Issue should be removed from the bill Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) NZICA has serious reservations about the PAYE proposals in the bill achieving a better or more equitable system. Taxpayers generally only fail to pay PAYE when they are in financial difficulties and adding penalties increases the debt, not the ability to pay. The submission recommends that PAYE be withdrawn from the bill and further consultation undertaken with a view to including changes in the next available tax bill. Comment Currently, if an employer does not pay the PAYE deductions, the employer may face an evasion shortfall penalty of 150 percent. The bill proposes that a new graduated penalty replace the current shortfall penalty that applies when an employer files an employer monthly schedule but does not pay the PAYE. Under the proposal, Inland Revenue will contact the employer and if payment or an arrangement for payment is not made a penalty will be imposed. If payment is made or an instalment arrangement is entered into within a month of the penalty being imposed, the penalty will reduce by 50 percent. If the PAYE remains unpaid another penalty is imposed each month the PAYE remains unpaid. This proposal has already been subject to consultation following the discussion document, Tax penalties, tax agents and disclosures. Several submissions supported the proposal, noting that it seemed fairer than the current penalty and would assist compliance with paying tax on time. The proposal is aimed at encouraging employers to come forward and either pay the late PAYE or enter into an instalment arrangement. The proposal is intended to increase communication between the employer and Inland Revenue and we consider it should help employers to meet their obligations. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 123 Issue: Alignment with late payment penalty rules Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The PAYE penalty should be aligned with the general late payment penalty rules, thus treating PAYE debt no differently to other revenues when payment is made late. If the taxpayer ultimately does not pay, prosecution and/or liquidation action is the appropriate remedy. Comment Non-payment of PAYE is, and should be treated more seriously than failure to pay some of the other taxes, as PAYE places a special responsibility on the employer to effect payment on behalf of the employee. Currently, the non-payment of PAYE by an employer may be subject to a shortfall penalty of 150 percent for evasion. This bill replaces the shortfall penalty with a more graduated penalty system, aimed at increasing voluntary compliance by employers with the PAYE obligations. Inland Revenue still has the ability to prosecute and/or liquidate the employer if payment is not made. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Level of penalty Submissions (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The PAYE penalty should be limited to half that proposed, that is, 10 percent reduced to 5 percent if paid within 30 days and so on. If the proposals proceed, any penalty should distinguish between small and large employers. The penalty for small taxpayers should be half that of large, more sophisticated, employers. Comment Officials agree with the submission that the PAYE penalty be reduced to half of that proposed. Reducing the penalty will, in our view, still assist voluntary compliance as the proposals intend. 124 In relation to the second submission, that the penalty should distinguish between small and large employers, the amount of the penalty assessed depends on the amount of PAYE not paid to Inland Revenue. Officials are not convinced that there is a strong case for imposing a lower penalty for one sector. Even so, the submission implies that a clear legislative distinction between small and large taxpayers would be needed. This definition would require more detailed consideration. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, and the rate of the PAYE penalty be halved. Issue: Application by receiver or liquidator Submission (61 – KPMG, 67 – McGrath Nicol Partners (NZ) Limited) The new penalty should not apply if a receiver or liquidator files an employer monthly schedule showing PAYE payable for a pre-receivership/pre-liquidation period but cannot pay the PAYE because of insufficient funds. Comment Officials agree with the submission. One of the aims of the penalty is to encourage the employer to pay the PAYE and obtain more clarity about the consequences of not doing so. In the case of receivership or liquidation, imposing a penalty will not result in a change in taxpayer behaviour. Inland Revenue already has debt priority in relation to PAYE, which ensures that liquidators and receivers understand the importance of this obligation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 125 Issue: Circularity Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) It is not possible to apply the proposed section in its current form as the penalty is calculated by reference to the “due amount”. However, the “due amount” includes the penalty amount. Comment As currently drafted, the proposal provides for subsequent impositions of the penalty to be based on the amount of PAYE not paid and any PAYE penalty imposed to date (the penalty compounds). As noted below, for reasons of simplicity and to ensure that the amount of the penalty does not accumulate too quickly, officials consider that the penalty should not compound. Officials therefore recommend the draft legislation no longer refer to “due amount”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, and no longer refer to “due amount”. Issue: Twice monthly PAYE threshold Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The thresholds for payment of twice-monthly PAYE should be lifted to better target larger taxpayers. While this is a simplification matter, it is also a penalty concern since PAYE and SSCWT obligations over $100,000 per year are required to be met 24 times a year, rather than 12. Comment This issue is outside of the scope of this bill, but is being considered by officials as part of work being undertaken in relation to compliance cost reduction for small and medium enterprises. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 126 Issue: Clarification of the provision Submission (Matter raised by officials) The amendments should include further clarification of the process to be followed in administering the penalty. Comment One of the basic tax obligations of employers is to withhold PAYE tax on behalf of their employees and pay the PAYE to Inland Revenue by specific dates. The current penalties that apply to defaulting PAYE obligations include late filing penalties, late payment penalties, shortfall penalties for evasion and prosecution. This bill introduces a new penalty which will apply if an employer has filed an employer monthly schedule but not paid the PAYE. It is aimed at providing incentives to the employer to comply with their obligations. Figure 1 illustrates how the penalty will apply: F IGURE 1 Officials consider that the bill should be amended to clearly set out that: • Inland Revenue will contact the employer two weeks after the PAYE was due, requesting payment (or that the employer enter an instalment arrangement) and set out the consequences in terms of the application of penalties if payment is not made; • a month following the contact, the employer will be notified and the PAYE penalty will be imposed; 127 • the penalty apply to all amounts on the employer monthly schedule (not just PAYE); and • another penalty will be imposed each month that the PAYE is not paid. Currently, for the penalty to be imposed the employer monthly schedule must be filed on time. Officials consider that this requirement should be removed. To avoid the imposition of the penalty the employer only has to file the schedule a day late. Under section 183F of the Tax Administration Act, penalties and interest do not apply to small amounts of tax. We consider that it should be made clear that this penalty also does not apply if the amount of the PAYE not paid is less than $100. Under section 183A, certain penalties can be remitted if the penalty arises as a result of circumstances beyond the control of the taxpayer. In section 183D, certain penalties can be remitted if the Commissioner is satisfied that the remission is consistent with the Commissioner’s duty to collect over time the highest net revenue. Officials consider that these remission provisions should also to apply this penalty. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 128 VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE REDUCTION Issue: Proposal does not match publicity Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 54 – ASB, 74R – Deloitte) The way the voluntary disclosure concession has been publicised does not match the way in which it has been implemented. The discussion document noted that “to increase the incentives for taxpayers to comply voluntarily, shortfall penalties payable when tax shortfalls are voluntarily disclosed before taxpayers are notified of pending audit or investigations will not be imposed ”. However, rather than ensuring the penalties are not imposed, the legislation still imposes the penalty but then reduces it by 100 percent. Comment Officials agree that the way the voluntary disclosure concession (which applies to the not taking reasonable care and the unacceptable tax position penalties) has been described does not exactly match the way it is being implemented. However, economically the result is the same. By reducing the penalty by 100 percent, rather than not imposing it, the Commissioner has to first consider whether the taxpayer took reasonable care or an unacceptable tax position. If the Commissioner determines that the taxpayer has not taken reasonable care, there is then an opportunity to discuss with the taxpayer whether systems can be put in place to ensure that the same thing does not occur again. It is also appropriate to first consider whether the penalty would apply, as it may indicate that there is a risk in that area which should be audited in the future. In some cases, if a tax shortfall occurs repeatedly, it is possible that the taxpayer has been grossly careless. For the penalty for gross carelessness to apply it will be necessary for Inland Revenue to show that the taxpayer has “a complete or high level of disregard of the consequences”. Officials consider it important that filing a voluntary disclosure is not seen as a “rubber stamping” exercise and that taxpayers are still expected to take reasonable care when taking their tax positions. Officials also consider that not imposing the penalty (rather than reducing it by 100 percent) gives the impression that there was no action of the taxpayer at fault, rather than giving the taxpayer credit for coming forward. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 129 Issue: Extension to other shortfall penalties Submission (39 – Owens Tax Advisors Ltd, 85 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The proposal regarding voluntary disclosures should also apply to “gross carelessness” or even all shortfall penalties. Inland Revenue will be more than compensated by use-of-money interest and it is inappropriate and counter-productive for any further penalty to apply. Comment The proposal in the bill is aimed at encouraging taxpayers to come forward and make voluntary disclosures. The proposal is aimed at the lower-end shortfall penalties and not the more serious gross carelessness, abusive tax position or evasion penalties. The current 75 percent reduction for shortfall penalties, which applies when taxpayers make voluntary disclosures before being notified of pending tax audits or investigation, will continue to apply to more serious penalties. For a gross carelessness penalty to apply, the taxpayer must have a “complete or high level of disregard for the consequences” (of the actions in question). If the taxpayer takes tax positions that fall within the more serious categories it is appropriate that they be penalised for doing so. Use-of-money interest compensates the Crown or the taxpayer for not having the use of their money and should not be regarded as a penalty. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reduction of abusive tax position shortfall penalty Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The abusive tax position shortfall penalty of 100 percent of the tax shortfall should be reduced by, say, 50 percent where a taxpayer voluntarily discloses the tax shortfall amount. This would encourage the disclosure of these positions – for example, if a taxpayer has a change of staff or change of tax agent which triggers the identification of an abusive tax position. Comment As noted earlier, the legislation currently provides for a 75 percent reduction of all shortfall penalties if the taxpayer voluntarily discloses the tax shortfall before the taxpayer is notified of a pending tax audit or investigation. 130 The proposal in this bill increases the reduction to 100 percent if the tax shortfall arose because the taxpayer did not take reasonable care or took an unacceptable tax position. If the tax shortfall arose because the taxpayer was grossly careless, took an abusive tax position or evaded tax, the shortfall penalty would continue to be reduced by 75 percent. Given the more serious nature of the abusive tax position (having a dominant purpose of reducing or removing a tax liability or giving tax benefits), officials consider that this already provides the correct incentive for taxpayers to disclose these tax positions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Notification of audit Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The rules for pre-audit notification require an overhaul as there is no incentive for the Commissioner to give taxpayers a period of time within which to make a voluntary disclosure. A better way to express the rule may be to say that no shortfall penalty can be imposed at all unless a taxpayer is given a right of disclosure. Comment For a penalty to be assessed the taxpayer’s actions must fail to meet a required standard. Consistent with the self-assessment objective of the tax system, taxpayers’ obligations are to take reasonable care when they take their tax positions – for example, when they file their returns, not when they have been warned by Inland Revenue that they may be audited. Giving taxpayers a warning before notification of a pending audit greatly reduces the incentives for taxpayers to take reasonable care when taking a tax position. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 131 Issue: Use-of-money interest Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Use-of-money interest should be reduced to half the applicable rate for a tax shortfall that is voluntarily disclosed before notification of a pending tax audit or investigation. Comment This issue is outside of the scope of this bill. Concerns in relation to use-of-money interest rates have already been raised with the Ministers of Finance and Revenue. Ministers have instructed officials to consider these matters further. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 34 – Toovey Eaton & Macdonald Limited, 39 – Owens Tax Advisors Ltd, 74R – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Consideration should be given to going further in the retrospectivity of the voluntary disclosure rule to: • 1 April 2003 (being the introduction of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty); • 1 April 2006; • 17 October 2006 (being the date the discussion document was released); or • 7 March 2007 (being the date the Minister of Revenue made a media announcement acknowledging that the change would be included in the bill). The Commentary on the bill states that the proposal once enacted will apply to voluntary disclosures made after the date that the bill was introduced, whereas the bill proposes that the reduction apply from 17 May 2007 (regardless of when the voluntary disclosure was made). 132 Comment As mentioned earlier, an amendment (section 141KB) was enacted in 2006, giving the Commissioner discretion to reverse or not to impose the unacceptable tax position penalty in certain circumstances. This has addressed (from 1 April 2003) many cases where the imposition of the penalty for simple errors has been overly harsh. The discretion does not apply to the not taking reasonable care penalty, but given that this penalty is considered on a case by case basis, the issue of undue penalties does not arise to the same extent. Since the Minister of Revenue’s announcement on 7 March 2007, taxpayers have been aware that the rules were going to change. In some cases, taxpayers were prepared to risk the possibility of being audited before the bill was introduced and delayed making voluntary disclosures. If the proposal were backdated further, a number of cases where penalties have already been imposed would have to be re-examined. Given this background and the fact that the law on voluntary disclosures has been clear, the case for further retrospectivity does not seem warranted. However, officials agree that the legislation needs to be clarified. It was always intended that the proposal apply to voluntary disclosures made on or after the date the bill was introduced. The bill should be amended to make this clear. Recommendation That the submission for further retrospectivity be declined. That the submission to clarify that the proposal apply to disclosures after introduction of the bill be accepted. Issue: Consequential amendment Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The definition of “disqualifying penalty” should be amended to read: “(iii) is not reduced or eliminated for voluntary disclosure by the taxpayer; and” It is unclear if the reference to “reduced” covers 100 percent reduction. Comment Officials disagree. If the proposal were amended to provide that the penalty was not imposed (as the submission has suggested), it might be appropriate to amend the legislation. However, the provision currently refers to “reduced” and officials consider that a 100 percent reduction of a penalty is a penalty that has been “reduced for voluntary disclosure by the taxpayer”. 133 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reduction for post-notification of audit voluntary disclosures Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The 40 percent reduction for “post-notification of audit” voluntary disclosures should be 75 percent for not taking reasonable care or unacceptable tax position shortfall penalties. The pre-audit notification process would be under less pressure if the post- audit notification reduction was 75 percent. Alternatively, the 75 percent reduction could apply instead of the 40 percent reduction when no pre-audit notification was made. Comment Officials consider that the 40 percent reduction given when a taxpayer voluntarily discloses a tax shortfall after being notified of a pending audit or investigation but before the audit begins, adequately reflects the administrative cost-saving of the disclosure. Voluntary disclosures at this time in general reflect a more moderate level of willingness to comply and the level of reduction needs to reflect this. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application to unacceptable interpretations Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposal to reduce the not taking reasonable care and unacceptable tax position shortfall penalties by 100 percent if the taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure before notification of audit should be amended to also apply to the unacceptable interpretation shortfall penalty. Comment From 1 April 2003, the unacceptable interpretation shortfall penalty became the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty. Officials consider that to encourage the voluntary disclosure of historical situations the legislation should be amended to cover the unacceptable interpretation penalty. This could be achieved by referring to the section numbers rather than the penalty names. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 134 TEMPORARY SHORTFALLS Issue: Time period Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed two-year period for a shortfall to be considered temporary by being permanently reversed or corrected should be extended to four years. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Extending the time period to four years aligns the period with the period applicable to the previous behaviour reduction (section 141FB(4)) for taxes other than PAYE, FBT, GST and RWT. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application date Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment should be effective from 1 April 1997 (when the penalty rules were introduced). The amendment is taxpayer-friendly and is clarifying Inland Revenue practice. This would provide certainty for taxpayers. Comment The proposal is taxpayer-friendly. In part, it clarifies Inland Revenue practice. However, the requirement for the reversal to occur within a set period of two or four years may mean that taxpayers who had a shortfall penalty reduced would have their situations reviewed. This would also create unnecessary administration costs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 135 Issue: Drafting of provision Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 141I(3) of the Tax Administration Act should be amended to clearly provide for instances when the shortfall has been corrected within the required period. Comment Sections 141I(3)(a) to (c) require that the shortfall be reversed, whereas section 141I(3)(d) anticipates that the shortfall has not yet been corrected. Officials consider that the section should be clarified to reflect that sections 141I(3) (a) to (c) apply when the reversal has taken place and section 141I(3)(d) when it has not. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 136 TAX COMPLIANCE INITATIVES Issue: Should apply to specific transactions Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The business group amnesty should be extended to specific transaction types, not just affected business groups. Comment The proposal is aimed at specific industries where tax evasion is a significant problem. Basing the amnesty on a specific industry allows: • the scope of the amnesty to be both limited and focussed on areas of concern; • specific industries of concern to be “cleaned up”; • Inland Revenue to focus audit resources on that industry; • all of the affected taxpayers to be identified; • use of industry-based groups to facilitate education of their members. These objectives are far less likely to be met if the proposal is focused on transaction types. Officials are also concerned that if the proposal were extended to apply to specific transaction types there could be an unforeseen revenue risk to the government. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Period in affected business Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The requirement for the person to be in the affected business throughout the period of three years before the end of the income year in which the amnesty becomes available should be replaced by the condition that the person has derived affected business income. 137 Comment Under the proposal, a taxpayer who comes forward limits their exposure in terms of undisclosed income to the current year and the previous year. By requiring that the taxpayer be in the affected business for the past three years the proposal will not apply to taxpayers who have exited the industry or to taxpayers who are new to the industry. The proposal is aimed at encouraging taxpayers to come forward, disclose income and then start complying – this will not be relevant if the taxpayer has left the industry and the taxpayer will not be part of an industry where evasion is a significant concern. Officials consider that taxpayers who are new to the industry have limited need for an amnesty. The cost of coming forward is significantly less than for other taxpayers who have been in the industry for a long period. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: No need to disclose assets and liabilities Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The requirement for a person to provide a statement of assets and liabilities for the income year ending before the income year in which the amnesty becomes available is excessive and unnecessary for an amnesty disclosure. The requirement for an asset and liability statement is associated with a full Inland Revenue-instigated audit and is not a requirement for a person making a voluntary disclosure. Therefore it should not be a requirement of an amnesty disclosure. Comment It is appropriate that taxpayers who come forward provide the Commissioner with the information necessary to quantify their taxable income for the period in question. One method used to measure the amount of income not disclosed is asset accretion. Under this method the taxpayer’s assets and liabilities at the beginning of the period being audited are compared with the assets and liabilities at the end of the period. The income disclosed is then subtracted and, allowing for certain factors such as the cost of living and inheritances, any increase in net assets is treated as undisclosed income. Disclosing the taxpayer’s assets and liabilities will also assist the Commissioner to determine the taxpayer’s ability to pay tax on the undisclosed income. For example, the statement of assets and liabilities might set out bank account details or assets that could be sold. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 138 Issue: Information request too far-reaching Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The requirement to provide “any other information required by the Commissioner” is an excessive request and too far-reaching. The requirement should be restricted to the provision of information in respect of the amnesty the person is applying for, not an unfettered information requirement. Information requirements, other than those that relate directly to the amnesty, should be the domain of formal requests. Comment Officials disagree. The draft legislation follows the precedent of similar provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 which require information to be provided to the Commissioner. Case law prevents Inland Revenue going on “fishing expeditions”. Inland Revenue can only request information for the purpose of administering the Inland Revenue Acts. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Debt repayment programme offered Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A debt repayment programme should be offered as part of the amnesty, so that it is clear to the tax evader at the outset what the payment arrangement will be. The ability to pay the debt assessed, under amnesty conditions, is an important consideration for a tax evader in deciding whether to come forward. Comment The amnesty proposal is aimed at encouraging taxpayers to come forward and disclose income from industries where tax evasion is a significant concern. The Commissioner has practices in place to provide payment arrangements that take into account the circumstances of the taxpayer. It is considered that this is the appropriate response to all debt, irrespective of whether it arises from an amnesty or otherwise. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 139 Issue: Application to taxpayers who have made disclosures before amnesty begins Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amnesty should extend to taxpayers who belong to the targeted industry and make a voluntary disclosure, purely of their own accord, not long before a limited amnesty begins for their industry. Under section 226B(4)(d), the proposal is that anyone already being audited by Inland Revenue would not be eligible to participate. Although we understand that it is important to provide a clear boundary of eligibility, this may result in an unfair result in some circumstances. Comment Officials agree that it is necessary to have a clear boundary setting out the taxpayers who are eligible to come forward under an amnesty. While there may be situations where it would be possible for a taxpayer who has made a disclosure before an amnesty to be treated more harshly than a taxpayer who has the benefit of the amnesty, the legislation cannot sensibly address this without a substantial blurring of the boundary. Consistency of treatment is an issue that should be determined where possible by the Commissioner. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Types of taxes covered Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The legislation should make it clear that all tax types are covered by the amnesty, including the social policy measures that are determined by income and administered through the tax system (family assistance, child support and student loans). Comment As previously noted, under the amnesty proposal, a taxpayer who comes forward limits their exposure in terms of undisclosed income to the current year and the previous year. The discussion documents, Options for dealing with industry-wide tax evasion and Tax penalties, tax agents and disclosures and the Commentary on this bill all commented on the effect coming forward under an amnesty would have in relation to social policy programmes. 140 As noted in the discussion document, Options for dealing with industry-wide tax evasion: “Similar considerations apply to social policy programmes based on assessed taxable income, such as family assistance, child support and student loans. Although a limit on the number of past years that are reassessed for income tax purposes means some assessments may never reflect an evader’s real income, if an amnesty could bring the evader into the tax system it would mean that more accurate assessments could be made for the most recent years and would continue to be made in the future. Custodial parents who received underpaid child support from a tax evader over a number of years might be better off receiving the correct amount in future years – rather than waiting in vain for underpaid child support from the past that may not be collectible.” 3 And the Commentary on the bill noted: “Any consequential effects of disclosing income for family assistance, student loans and child support liabilities will also be included in the assessment.” 4 Officials therefore note that the current proposal already allows the Commissioner to extend the amnesty to all tax types, including social policy measures that are determined by income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application of amnesty to all income Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 95 – New Zealand Law Society) The requirement in section 226B(1) that the amnesty relates to a business group, where the type of activity is the person’s “main business” should be amended to “significant part of their business”. If the amnesty’s scope only covers undisclosed income from the nominated industry, it will not be attractive to a person under- declaring tax in a variety of industries. Comment In developing this proposal officials considered the option of applying the amnesty to income from the specific industry or to all of the taxpayer’s income. We consider that there is a revenue risk if the amnesty applies extensively to income from other sources. While we appreciate that applying the amnesty only to income from a particular source reduces the incentives for taxpayers to come forward but consider this to be a necessary trade-off in introducing the proposal. 3 Paragraph 1.10 4 Page 89 141 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Commitment to audit activity Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Inland Revenue should commit to undertaking audit activity in the business group after the amnesty finishes. There will be little incentive to disclose errors if it is perceived there is no likelihood of discovery at a later date. Comment Officials agree with the submission. The discussion documents, Options for dealing with industry-wide tax evasion and Tax penalties, tax agents and disclosures and the Commentary on this bill all commented that following an amnesty the affected industry would be subject to increased audit and any tax shortfalls detected would face the full range of penalties and other sanctions provided in the legislation. Officials agree with the submission but consider that including such a commitment in the legislation is unnecessary. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Disclosure of the nature of the mistake Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section 226B(5) should include a requirement for the person to state the nature of the mistake, non-disclosure or error. There needs to be a requirement for the person to disclose the nature of the mistake, otherwise the only way Inland Revenue can determine the adjustment required is through a tax audit. The mistake could be something as simple as rebates from a particular source not being declared, which should be able to be adjusted without an audit being carried out. 142 Comment Officials agree with the submission, including a requirement for the person to disclose why the adjustment is necessary may result in the adjustment being made without a complete audit taking place. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Benefiting from more than one amnesty Submission (95 – New Zealand Law Society) The requirement that a taxpayer not have benefited from a previous amnesty (proposed section 226B(4)(c)) should be removed. The Commissioner can ensure that taxpayers do not benefit from more than one amnesty by framing the terms of each amnesty so that there is no overlap. Comment Officials disagree with the submission. The taxpayer may change occupations and thus qualify under a subsequent amnesty for another industry with the overall concessional tax treatment becoming substantial. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Prosecution by other Crown entities Submission (95 – New Zealand Law Society) The proposal should be extended to prevent all Crown agencies (not just the Commissioner) from instituting a prosecution. Comment Under section 226B(9), the Commissioner must not prosecute the taxpayer (under the Tax Administration Act or any other Act). Officials consider that it is not appropriate to limit the Crown’s ability to take legal action under other statutes for non-tax related matters, merely because the taxpayer has come forward under a tax amnesty. 143 In addition, under the secrecy provisions, the Commissioner would be prevented from disclosing to other agencies information gathered under an amnesty. This would make the submission’s proposal unworkable. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 144 MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES Issue: Revenue-neutral transactions should not be subject to shortfall penalties Submission (39 – Owens Tax Advisors Ltd, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Revenue-neutral transactions, particularly between associated persons, should not be subject to shortfall penalties. When a transaction or event is revenue-neutral there is by definition no tax “shortfall”. An example is the circumstance when a taxpayer identifies an error and discloses this to Inland Revenue before any tax credit or refund or other loss of revenue. Comment The aim of the shortfall penalties legislation is to encourage taxpayers to take correct tax positions, rather than to pay their tax on time which is covered by the late payment penalty. There are a number of situations where there is no loss to the revenue yet it is appropriate to impose a shortfall penalty. For example, consider a company that is in a loss situation which does not take care in taking its tax positions. Because the company is carrying forward losses there is no loss to the revenue. It may, however, be appropriate to impose a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care. If the company’s actions were able to be considered under the shortfall penalty rules, it would be treated differently from a company which is in a profit situation merely because the first company had accumulated losses. The example noted in the submission will be dealt with by the voluntary disclosure proposal in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 145 Issue: Review of proposals Submission (39 – Owens Tax Advisors Ltd, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) It is strongly recommended that the Finance and Expenditure Committee schedule a review of the shortfall penalty rules after a period of enactment of 12 or 18 months to ensure they are being applied as intended and that if there is any departure then appropriate amendments can be considered. Comment As part of the ongoing review of the compliance and penalties legislation, officials will monitor the amendments to ensure they meet their objectives and will respond to specific issues as they arise. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 147 Company tax rate consequentials 149 OVERVIEW Clauses 9, 80, 92, 93, 97 to 99, 108(1), (2) and (4), 109, 110, 112 to 116, 117(2), 119(2), 121 to 128, 130, 134, 135(30) and (35) and 178 to 181 The Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Act 2007 reduced the company tax rate, the tax rate for widely held savings vehicles and the top rate for portfolio investment entities from 33% to 30%. The bill makes a number of consequential and transitional amendments relating to the tax rate reduction. Currently, the maximum imputation and dividend withholding payment (DWP) credit ratio is 33/67. Without transitional provisions, a reduction in the company tax rate would cause the maximum ratio to fall to 30/70, thereby disadvantaging some taxpayers where the underlying company tax has been paid at the 33% rate. The bill introduces a transitional imputation period from the start of the 2008–09 income year to 31 March 2010. During this period companies will be able to allocate credits at the maximum 33/67 ratio as long as they have unused credits relating to tax paid at 33%. Nine submissions discussed the transitional and consequential amendments. Most were supportive but considered that the period allowed for imputation and DWP credits to be imputed at 33/67 was too short. There were also strong representations that the RWT rate for dividends should be reduced to 30%, and a number of detailed submissions on other matters. 150 TAX RATES Issue: Support for reduced company tax rate Submissions (23 – Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 24 – AMP Financial Services & AMP Capital Investors (NZ) Ltd, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 49 – Contact Energy Ltd, 61 – KPMG, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 74R – Deloitte, 84 – New Zealand Chambers of Commerce, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The submissions are very supportive of the reduced company tax rate and the rates for savings vehicles. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Company, trust and individual tax rates generally Submissions (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 61 – KPMG, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 84 – New Zealand Chambers of Commerce, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Further reductions to the company tax rate are required in the medium-term. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Chambers of Commerce) Other tax rates, such as the individual and trust tax rates, should also be reviewed. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Chambers of Commerce, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A clear and early signal should be made by the government about the future of personal and trust tax rates. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The government should signal very clearly its intentions in respect of personal tax rates. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The submission expresses disappointment that the 2005 decision to inflation-adjust income tax thresholds has been abandoned. (New Zealand Chamber of Commerce) 151 Comment These submissions on further company tax cuts, and personal and trustee marginal tax rates are outside the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 152 IMPUTATION AND DWP CREDITS Issue: Transitional period for imputation and DWP credits Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The submission supports the transitional period, from the start of the 2008–09 income year to 31 March 2010, for allocating imputation and DWP credits up to a maximum ratio of 33/67. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submissions (23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 24 – AMP Financial Services & AMP Capital Investors (NZ) Ltd, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 49/49B – Contact Energy Ltd, 61 – KPMG, 74R – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The transitional period for allocating imputation and DWP credits at a maximum ratio of 33/67 should be extended indefinitely, or for at least 5 or 10 years. Comment Generally, the submissions consider that companies should be able to decide when distributions of pre-2008–09 profits, which are represented by the 33/67 imputation credits, should be made, and that those decisions should be made in the interests of the company and its ongoing business, rather than for tax-driven reasons. Submissions expressed concern about the two-year transitional period and its effect on companies’ current plans to reinvest profits. They consider that the transitional period needs to be sufficient to allow investment and growth cycles to be worked through and that the two-year window is insufficient. They argue that the proposed transitional rules will create an incentive to distribute company profits earlier than would otherwise have happened to ensure that 33% credits will not be trapped within the company, or alternatively, that profits will not be available for distribution because of reinvestment plans. Further, NZICA argues that the proposed legislation, in effect, requires two accounts to be maintained and tracked, and that therefore there is no compliance or audit reason for limiting the period over which the 33/67 credits can be used. They consider that because it creates additional compliance costs, a company would only continue with two separate imputation accounts if there were good commercial reasons for not distributing profits by way of dividends. 153 Officials understand that companies’ dividend distribution decisions over the transitional period could impact on their reinvestment plans. There are three responses to this: • The transitional period really begins in May 2007 so that the window for the use of the credits is really almost three years. • Companies will have the option to distribute credits during the transitional period while still retaining the underlying cash, by making taxable bonus issues. While this is not a complete or totally satisfactory answer, it does provide a further alternative to paying cash dividends. • The fact that pre-31 March 2008 profits are not distributed before the end of the transitional period does not necessarily mean that excess credits will be trapped. Any excess credits may still be able to be attached to distributable reserves that have not borne tax in the company’s hands. However, officials acknowledge that in some cases if the 33/67 credits are not distributed by the end of the transitional period a portion may be trapped. If relief was to be allowed for a significantly longer period, officials consider that a dual imputation system would be required, whereby tax paid at the 30% rate would need to be recorded in a separate account from that paid at the 33% rate. Credits paid at the 33% rate would have to be used before the 30% pool could be allocated. Such a system would have higher compliance and administration costs than the proposal included in the bill. Further, if there are subsequent company tax rate reductions, three or more different accounts may be required. The government chose a two-year simplified transition for the 33/67 credits. This allows companies an option on whether they credit at 33/67 or the new standard ratio of 30/70. A number of companies will go straight to 30/70 because that will be in their shareholders’ interests – in particular, this could happen when the company tax is effectively a final tax, as it will be for most savings vehicles. The current proposals do not require dual accounts to be formally maintained, and officials do not consider that they should, because of the compliance and administration cost issues involved. However, officials note that if companies elect to impute at 33/67 in the transitional period they will need to keep sufficient extra records to be able to confirm they had not overdrawn their 33/67 credits as at 31 March 2010. It is also noteworthy that Australia has had three company tax rate changes since it introduced its franking rules and has had different transitional arrangements for each change. There is no obvious right answer. Officials consider that a transitional period that ends on 31 March 2010 provides the best balance between providing relief and minimising compliance and fiscal costs. We recommend that the transitional period should not be extended beyond 31 March 2010. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 154 Issue: Transitional timeframe and balance dates Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 49 – Contact Energy Ltd) For companies with September balance dates, the transitional period will be only 18 months. This is a reason why the transition period should be extended. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) As a June balance date taxpayer, it should be noted that under the bill, Contact will have only 21 months to distribute imputation credits at the 33/67 ratio. (Contact Energy Ltd) Comment Companies have known since May 2007 (when the bill was introduced) that the transition period would end on 31 March 2010. Therefore, it is not correct to say that the transition period is less than two years. It is, however, correct that with regard to their last few 33% tax payments, later balance date companies will have this shorter period. After discussions with submitters, officials believe that this late balance date effect does not seem to be the major problem. Rather, the problem is with companies that have a bank of credits because they have not fully distributed their past tax paid profits. This is dealt with in the preceding submission. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Technical complications with transition Submission (Matter raised with officials by Russell McVeagh) That section ME 8, which sets the maximum imputation credit ratio, and proposed section MZ 10, which overrides this for the transitional period, do not achieve the desired outcome. Comment Where a company paying a dividend has a late balance date and a dividend is paid between 1 April 2008 and the company’s balance date, the ratio is inappropriately limited to 30/70. We agree with the submission and recommend that the imputation year reference in section ME 8 (and similar sections MG 8 and 12) be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 155 Issue: Maximum credit ratios Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The words “income” and expenditure” should be deleted from proposed sections MZ 10(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2004, and section 140BB(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Comment The submission argues that including the two words could cause confusion in circumstances where a company: • has an imputation account credit balance as at 31 March 2008, but no retained earnings at that date; or • receives a dividend with a 33/67 imputation credit attached to it, with the dividend being taxed at 30%. A company referred to under the first bullet point should be able to retain the imputation credits, while in the second case, the full imputation credit should be available to be allocated to dividends paid to the underlying shareholders. Officials will clarify the drafting. Recommendation That the submission be agreed in principle. Issue: Clarification of policy Submission (74R – Deloitte) The bill provides that tax paid in connection with the “old” company rate (33%) can give rise to imputation credits distributable at the 33/67 ratio. On the face of it because the rate of RWT is not connected with the rate of company tax, the fact that RWT will still be withheld at 33% will not give rise to imputation credits that can be allocated at the 33/67 ratio. We would appreciate clarification of this point. Comment We agree that the treatment of pre-and post- tax rate change RWT credits should be clarified. RWT deducted at 33% when the 33% tax rate applied, should result in 33/67 imputation credits. 156 However, where the 30% tax rate applies, RWT deducted at 33% should not be regarded as 33/67 credits, as the surplus 3 cents will be refundable. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Dividends received by companies and other 30% tax entities Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The formula in section MZ 13, which caps the imputation credit to 30% for taxpayers whose tax rate is 30%, should be modified or deleted. Alternatively, if section MZ 13 is not deleted, it is inconsistent with New Zealand’s imputation model to gross the dividend up by an amount greater than the credit that is ultimately allowed in respect of the dividend. Comment Section MZ 13 prevents an intermediate company, which pays tax at 30%, from being able to use the additional 3% credit to shelter other income that would be taxed at 30%. Section MZ 13 correctly reflects the policy intent. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 157 QUALIFYING COMPANY ELECTION TAX (QCET) Submission (61 – KPMG, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The QCET change should apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 year. Comment The current application date is 17 May 2007, the date when the bill was introduced and the change was announced. Tax avoidance measures, like the one subject to the submission, generally apply from the date when they are announced. If a later application date applied, taxpayers may be able to take actions that would negate the effect intended. Officials consider, therefore, that the application date should not be deferred. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 158 RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX ON DIVIDENDS Issue: Review of RWT Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 61 – KPMG, 74R – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The suggested review of RWT on dividends is supported. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Rate of RWT on dividends Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) In time, a comprehensive RWT regime (similar to that applying to interest) should be introduced for dividends. Comment This submission will be considered as part of the review. Recommendations That the submission be noted. 159 Issue: Interim RWT rate on dividends Submissions (23 – Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Incorporated, 24 – AMP Financial Services and AMP Capital Investors, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 49 – Contact, 54 – ASB, 61 – KPMG, 74R – Deloitte) RWT on dividends should be reduced to 30%. Comment The submissions point out that retaining the 33% RWT rate for dividends means that all fully imputed dividends will now be subject to RWT, which may add compliance costs for companies. Officials understand that listed companies will incur extra administration costs, but the present systems they use to pay their dividends will allow for the deduction of RWT at 33%. Also, small companies may have no RWT deduction systems in place, but their shareholders will often be 33% taxpayers and RWT at 33% is appropriate. However, it seems that a number of unit trusts and group investment funds that pay dividends have no RWT systems in place because to date they have only paid fully imputed dividends and therefore have not needed to deduct RWT. There seems to be agreement that no one RWT rate on dividends is appropriate. However, we agree with the savings industry that it seems inappropriate to require widely held unit trusts and group investment funds to implement systems to account for RWT at 33/67 when the RWT system will be reviewed. Other than this, we recommend that the rate stay at 33/67. Recommendation That the general RWT rate be 33/67, but that widely held unit trusts and group investment funds that have not previously accounted for RWT on dividends be allowed to account for it at 30/70. 160 GENERAL SUBMISSIONS Issue: Excess imputation credits for individuals Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) An individual’s excess imputation credits should be refunded. Comment In 1988, when the company imputation system was introduced, it was decided that excess imputation credits would not be refunded, because of the revenue cost of doing so. The government is in the process of putting together its tax policy work programme for the coming year and the priority of the wider imputation credit review will be determined in that context. This submission should be considered as part of this review. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Sole traders and partnerships Submission (61 – KPMG, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Sole traders and partnerships should be permitted to restructure as companies without this action being considered as “tax avoidance”. (KPMG) Parliament and Inland Revenue should make a clear statement that the change in the company tax rate is intended as an incentive to incorporation. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment These submissions appear to be making the same point – that it be stated that incorporation of a business is not tax avoidance per se. 161 In a very high portion of cases the restructuring of a business into a corporate form cannot be considered as “tax avoidance”. However, applying the tax avoidance provisions may be considered if the restructuring results in the alienation of income that is essentially income from personal services. For example, medical professionals who corporatise their private practice and then appear to have a low taxable income may have to justify whether their use of this structure is appropriate from a taxation perspective. We will clarify this issue in a subsequent Tax Information Bulletin following enactment of the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but the point be clarified. Issue: Roll-over relief for re-structured businesses Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Statutory relief should be provided to allow unincorporated businesses to convert to companies without tax consequences. Comment Sole traders, trusts and partnerships of individuals and trusts, may wish to restructure their businesses as companies to benefit from the reduced company tax rate. By itself this is likely to be acceptable from a tax policy perspective (see officials’ comment on the previous submission). However, under normal tax rules, this type of restructuring could cause tax costs – for example, by way of income arising from depreciation recovery, profit on disposal of livestock or trading stock, disposal of growing trees, or income and expenditure from financial arrangements. Livestock, trees and depreciable assets are likely to be the significant items from the taxpayers’ perspective. The vendor (the individual or the trust) will have to dispose of these items at market value and often their tax book carrying value is significantly less, with the result being significant taxable income. Further, the company will either not get a corresponding tax write down, or that write down will happen over time. These tax consequences could be avoided if there was a transitional period during which these assets could be transferred into a new company at tax book value. This is frequently called a “roll-over”. 162 There could be a policy problem with the transfer of trees into companies – the individual has presumably taken the deductions by this stage at their marginal rates, and the corporatisation of the trees may result in the eventual income upon harvest not being taxed at the individual’s marginal tax rate. However, this is a specific concern that could be dealt with separately if necessary. The general policy concern with a roll-over approach is that it would set a precedent for business restructuring to be treated in this way in the future. Changes to entity- specific tax rules occur every so often and there appears little justification to provide roll-over relief in this situation and not others. Further, roll-over relief has the potential to be fiscally expensive. The corporatisation of a business is often part of the business’s life cycle and generally the private sector is able to plan for this. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Taxation of fully imputed dividends Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Fully imputed dividends received by shareholders in widely held companies should be taxed at a maximum rate of 30%. Comment The submission points out that shareholders in widely held companies can achieve the maximum tax rate of 30% by investing in portfolio investment entities and certain other widely held collective investment vehicles. While officials acknowledge that this is technically correct, the reduction in the tax rate for those vehicles was made to encourage savings and introduce more neutral tax treatment of different savings and corporate entities. Officials are concerned that there is a boundary issue in allowing fully imputed dividends received by shareholders of widely held companies to be taxed at 30%. The objective of the 30% tax rate for portfolio investment entity investors is to increase collective savings, which are generally longer term savings – taxing individuals’ and trusts’ dividends as final income at 30% will not necessarily achieve this. In addition, the fiscal cost of the change in tax rate is likely to be high. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 163 Issue: Attribution rule for personal services Submission (74B – Deloitte) Imputation credits under section ME 4(1)(ab), which provides for credits to arise when income is attributed from an intermediary company to the relevant individual under the attribution rule for personal services, should remain at 49.25% of the amount attributed, when the company is owned by a trust. Alternatively, dividends paid from income that has been attributed to shareholders could be exempt from tax. Comment The attribution rule is an anti-avoidance rule designed to ensure that wage earners cannot avoid the 39% tax rate by channelling their income through a company or a trust. It does this by treating, in defined circumstances, the person providing the personal services as deriving the income that would otherwise be derived by the intermediary company or trust. Some double taxation can occur when the attribution rule is applied to income derived by a company because the cash still has to be extracted from the company as dividends. Section ME 4(1)(ab) partially or fully relieves, depending on the circumstances, the double taxation that could otherwise occur. With the change in the company tax rate to 30% the imputation credit that arises under the section will be reduced to 42.86%, consistent with the new maximum imputation credit ratio of 30/70. If the attribution applies to a year before the change in the company tax rate, the applicable rate should remain at 49.25%. This is achieved because the change to section ME 4(1)(ab) applies in relation to income attributed in the 2008–09 and later income years. The submission asks that the deemed credit remain at 33/67 permanently. However, this will not, in the absence of other changes, achieve the submissions desired outcome as after 31 March 2010 dividends can only be imputed at 30/70. Officials do not support allowing the maximum imputation credit to be maintained at 33/67 indefinitely, because that rate is not consistent with the new company tax rate. However, we consider that it would be possible to provide relief by exempting the dividends if a company paying a dividend meets certain criteria. Relief would be provided by ensuring that dividends paid by eligible companies were either fully imputed or exempt from tax. This proposal is consistent with the tax treatment of qualifying companies. Where a company elected to be subject to this treatment, a credit would not arise under section ME 4(1)(ab). 164 Relief would apply when a company’s only activity was the one from which the income had been attributed. Also, it would be acceptable if it earned some incidental interest. However, if the company engaged in other activities, dividends would be subject to tax in the normal way, and a credit would arise under section ME 4(1)(ab). This would prevent the proposed treatment being manipulated to gain unintended benefits. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that relief be allowed by providing that dividends paid by eligible companies in relation to amounts attributed be exempt from tax using the qualifying company exemption mechanism. Issue: Branch equivalent tax accounts (BETAs) Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Notwithstanding the international tax review proposals, BETA credit balances should remain available to allow for future repatriation of profits taxed at 33%. Comment The future repatriation of profits will be taxed at 30% and the BETA amendment adjusts the BETA balances to reflect this. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting Submission (74R – Deloitte) Doubling-up of numbering in new subpart MZ should be corrected. Comment This is simply a consequence of the fact that two tax bills were introduced at the same time. As part of the standard enactment process this will automatically be resolved. Recommendation That the submission be noted.

The biggest change proposed in the bill is to allow IFRS accounting methods to be used as a basis to spread income and expenditure under the financial arrangement tax rules. Key features of the proposed amendments Use of IFRS spreading methods for financial arrangements The proposed amendments will generally require taxpayers who prepare IFRS financial accounts to use IFRS spreading methods for taxation purposes. From a policy perspective, this is the correct treatment because aligning the tax timing rules with IFRS will reduce the compliance costs associated with applying the more sophisticated accounting rules required by IFRS. However, submissions have raised concerns around many derivative financial instruments and foreign-currency denominated financial arrangements where the IFRS fair value (market value) accounting treatment would create too much volatility in the income and expenditure calculation if adopted for tax. This is because the fair value (market value) treatment would recognise gains and losses before they are realised. Submissions have stated that in these instances the IFRS method should not be the default method, and alternative methods that are consistent with the financial arrangement rules (but without the undesirable effects of volatility) should be provided. Officials agree that the volatility that results from using the fair value method or foreign-currency denominated financial arrangements is inappropriate in some situations. It was first proposed to deal with this problem by allowing taxpayers to use alternative methods set out in determinations. However, after further consideration, officials now believe that, to provide more certainty, it would be better to set out alternative spreading methods that avoid the volatility problem within the core tax legislation. Alternative spreading methods Officials have consulted with some of the submitters who were concerned about the volatility issue. We recommend that, to deal with their concerns, alternative spreading methods should be provided in legislation. 4 Two alternative spreading methods are recommended in legislation for derivative instruments and foreign-currency denominated financial arrangements. Under the first alternative method, taxpayers would be allowed to defer any gains and losses that have been reported in equity reserves under IFRS. The second alternative method would require taxpayers to spread a reasonable amount of income and expenditure based on expected considerations over the term of a financial arrangement. These alternative methods would address most, if not all, the volatility concerns that taxpayers have. Details of how the method would apply in practice to some financial instruments could also be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin that follows the enactment of this tax bill. Other spreading methods We also recognise that there are technical concerns around the availability of alternative methods set out in determinations because taxpayers may be unable to meet some conditions or the determinations are not wide enough in scope. We recommend that these determinations be amended by legislation where possible to make them more flexible. Issues were also raised concerning the present determinations that define the financial arrangement portion of a wider arrangement (for example, optional or mandatory convertible notes). Likewise, the status of the current determination on long-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property was raised. We recommend that the existing tax treatment set out in determinations should continue to apply. To provide flexibility to deal with complex derivative instruments, the bill provides a structure that allows taxpayers to apply for, and the Commissioner to issue, new determinations to deal with specific financial arrangements. 5 IFRS METHOD Issue: Mandatory adoption of the IFRS fair value accounting method for taxation purposes Submissions (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 85A – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 74R – Deloitte, 54 – ASB Bank, 49 – Contact Energy Limited, 46 – TrustPower, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The IFRS fair value method should be elective, and not be compulsory or become the default method. The Commissioner should determine alternative methods that are able to be used. A safety mechanism from the mandatory application of the fair value method is needed. Mandatory application should only apply if the “amortised cost” method is used under IFRS. Comment Under the proposed amendments, taxpayers who prepare IFRS accounts will be required to use the IFRS accounting method to calculate the timing of their taxable income and expenditure under the financial arrangement tax rules. From a policy perspective, this is desirable because accounting rules have become more sophisticated under IFRS and it will reduce compliance costs if the tax rules are aligned with IFRS. However, using the IFRS method to calculate the timing of income and expenditure does create volatility because the method brings in unrealised gains and losses. The IFRS method can thus create unfair results when applied for tax purposes, particularly if taxpayers are not actively trading in financial arrangements. It is important to recognise that the IFRS fair value method does not apply to all financial arrangements. Many New Zealand dollar-denominated financial assets and most financial liabilities are accounted for using the effective interest method under IFRS. This method, which is equivalent to the yield to maturity method under the old financial arrangement rules, applies to held to maturity investments, loans and receivables and all non-derivative liabilities. The fair value method does, however, apply to all financial arrangements that are held for trading purposes, all derivative instruments and financial assets/liabilities that are hedged. 6 Existing financial arrangement timing rules incorporate market value-based methods that bring to tax all gains and losses (including unrealised gains and losses) arising from financial arrangements. However, the present market value-based method is elective and is applied only by taxpayers who are actively trading in the financial arrangements. At present, taxpayers can also reduce volatility in their income and expenditure by using one of the methods specified in determinations that remove the “unexpected” components (the volatility) from the tax net. Officials agree that there should be alternatives to the fair value method. Alternative spreading methods are recommended below for foreign-currency denominated financial arrangements and arrangements that are fair-valued under IFRS so that taxpayers are not forced into the IFRS method. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in principle. Issue: Modification of the IFRS method for taxation purposes Submissions (74R – Deloitte, 54 – ASB Bank, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) If the IFRS fair value method is mandatory, then at a minimum, fair value movements that are reported in the statement of changes in equity should not be returned for taxation purposes. Comment Under the IFRS hedge accounting rules, the fair value movements of a cash flow hedge instrument or a hedge of net foreign investments can be reported in the statement of changes in equity, instead of the profit and loss statement. This has the effect of removing some volatility from the profit and loss account. Financial assets that are available for sale also qualify for this accounting treatment. This accounting treatment essentially allows any profit and loss on the hedge instrument or available for sale financial assets to be deferred until the underlying item or event being hedged is realised. A financial arrangement can qualify for this hedge accounting treatment if certain criteria are met. The financial arrangement has to be designated as a hedge at inception, and the hedge relationship and effectiveness of the hedge has to be measured and documented. In addition, there are rules around the types of financial instruments that can be used as a hedge instrument, the sort of exposure that can be hedged and the effectiveness of the hedge relationship. 7 Officials have recommended below that the amounts deferred under IFRS can also be removed for taxation purposes to deal with the volatility problem, subject to appropriate safeguards. More extensive alignment with the IFRS hedge accounting treatment is not recommended because the revenue risks of such an alignment can not be evaluated properly at this stage. Although safeguards are provided by the IFRS hedge accounting rules, these rules are new to the financial reporting environment in New Zealand. The hedging rules are complex and it is not yet clear how they will be applied in practice. We believe that the risk benefit ratio is such that this submission should be noted and we will continue to monitor the application of the IFRS hedge accounting rules in practice. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Alternative methods to exclude volatility Submissions (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 74R and 74A – Deloitte, 54 – ASB Bank, 49 – Contact Energy Limited, 46 – TrustPower, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Alternative spreading methods (or the expected value method) should be provided in legislation for some financial arrangements that would otherwise use the IFRS fair value method and create volatility. Comment To address the volatility concerns, we recommend two alternative methods for derivative instruments that would be fair valued under IFRS and foreign-currency denominated financial arrangements. Under the first alternative method, taxpayers would be allowed to defer any gains and losses that have been reported in equity reserves under IFRS. This would apply to financial arrangements that qualify and are effective cash flow hedges or hedges of net foreign investments under IFRS. The second alternative method would require taxpayers to spread a reasonable amount of income and expenditure based on expected payments. This means that any in-built gains and losses on these instruments would have to be spread in accordance with the objective of the financial arrangement rules. 8 These alternative methods will only be available if some conditions are met. For example, the alternative methods would not be allowed if a taxpayer is in the business of dealing in the financial arrangement. The IFRS fair value method is appropriate and volatility is unlikely to be a significant problem for taxpayers that are in the business of dealing in the financial arrangement. Similarly, financial instruments that have been entered into for speculative purposes would not be able to use this method. There is insufficient information on the types of derivative instruments and their IFRS effect. Therefore it is necessary to further limit the risks by limiting the availability of the alternative methods. This consideration will be balanced against the need to alleviate concerns about volatility under the IFRS method. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to appropriate safeguards. Issue: Alternative method based on pre-IFRS GAAP Submissions (80 – Rio Tinto, 74R – Deloitte, 49 – Contact Energy Limited, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) An alternative method to IFRS that has regard to pre-IFRS GAAP should be acceptable. Taxpayers should have the option to apply an alternative method to IFRS which: • is consistent with the purpose of the financial arrangement rules (that is, based on the principles of accruing income or expenditure over the life of the financial arrangement); • is consistently applied by taxpayers over the life of the financial instrument; and • has regard to pre-IFRS GAAP. Comment The submissions are driven by taxpayers’ concerns that the fair value method under IFRS would become the method they must use for taxation purposes. Although following IFRS methods for taxation purposes would save compliance costs, the fair value method would create volatility for taxpayers if adopted for taxation purposes. Officials agree that the fair value method should not be compulsory. However, pre-IFRS GAAP is not an acceptable benchmark for taxation purposes. The policy intention of aligning accounting practice and tax rules would be compromised if taxpayers were allowed to rely on pre-IFRS GAAP rather than the IFRS rules beyond the transition periods provided in the bill. This option would also potentially create undesirable tax planning opportunities. 9 Instead, we have recommended two alternative methods that would deal with the volatility problem. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Alternative methods for derivative instruments Submissions (74R – Deloitte, 49 – Contact Energy Limited) An alternative method is needed for complex derivative instruments such as cross- currency interest-rate swaps. Alternative methods are needed, as fair value is not appropriate for derivative financial instruments where there is an intention to hold until maturity. The expected value method should be applied to foreign currency options. Comment The alternative methods recommended earlier as alternatives to the IFRS fair value method could be applied to these financial arrangements. The proposed legislation is unlikely to provide absolute certainty to all the complex derivative instruments that taxpayers may enter into. However, the proposed legislation does provide a structure that is sufficiently flexible to deal with new or innovative financial arrangements. If taxpayers do not or cannot meet the requirements to use the alternative methods, they can apply to the Commissioner for taxpayer or product-specific determinations. The Commissioner may also issue additional determinations to deal with particular types of financial arrangements. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 10 Issue: Who must use the IFRS method Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) It should be made clear who must apply the IFRS method. Comment Under the proposed legislation, “a person who is a party to a financial arrangement must use the IFRS method if the person prepares financial reports for financial arrangements using NZ IAS 39”. The submission points out that it is not clear who must apply the IFRS method because the term “financial reports” is not defined. The policy intention is that any taxpayer who prepares “financial statements” that are in compliance with IFRS would use the IFRS method to calculate income and expenditure on their financial arrangements. We recommend that the legislation be amended to clarify this point. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: IFRS method for branch equivalent calculation Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) International standards should be acceptable for the purpose of calculating a controlled foreign company’s (CFC’s) branch equivalent income. For this purpose IFRS should mean “NZ IAS 39 or its equivalent” in the CFC’s country of residence. Comment Taxpayers with a controlled foreign company (CFC) are required to calculate the branch equivalent income of the CFC using New Zealand tax law. The proposed legislation allows taxpayers who prepare financial statements that comply with IFRS to use the method adopted in the financial statements for taxation purposes. This means that the IFRS method must be a method that is compliant with the New Zealand equivalent to IFRS. 11 The CFC rules are currently under review. However, the New Zealand equivalent to IFRS is based on international accounting standards that are used in many other countries. If a CFC prepares its accounts based on international accounting standards, then the method used in the CFC’s financial accounts should also be acceptable in principle. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 12 DETERMINATIONS AND ALTERNATIVES Issue: 63 rd day election criteria under Determinations G9C and G14B Submissions (74A – Deloitte) The Commissioner should be able to accept late elections. The period allowed for electing into Determinations G14B and G9C should be extended to any time during an income year for a new company or new groups of companies which are established during an income year. Special rules are needed for companies that begin transactions covered by the determinations during an income year. Comment The bill provides an option for taxpayers to use specific spreading methods set out in determinations (namely G9C, G14B and G27) instead of IFRS methods. Determinations G9C and G14B provide methods which allow taxpayers to spread only their “expected” income and expenditure under foreign currency financial arrangements and forward contracts. Under the current Determinations G9C and G14B, taxpayers must elect to use these determinations on or before the 63 rd day of their accounting period for the income year. If a taxpayer is a member of a group of companies, the group must elect into the determinations on or before the earliest 63 rd day of the accounting periods of all group members. An early election notice is necessary because taxpayers should not be allowed to opt into the expected value treatment only when their tax positions under the alternative spreading methods are known. This would create an opportunity for taxpayers to self- elect into the determinations only when the tax outcome suits them. However, the election criteria in Determinations G9C and G14B are too restrictive and do not take into account new companies that begin business part-way through the year or companies that enter into a transaction that is covered by the determinations part-way through the year. Despite the provisions in the Determinations G9C and G14B, a taxpayer should be allowed to use these determinations if the taxpayer has notified the Commissioner of the election: • on or before the 63 rd day in the first accounting period or on the first balance date, whichever is earlier, if the taxpayer or the group is newly established; or 13 • on or before the 63 rd day after the first transaction that falls into either Determinations G9C or G14B were entered into by the taxpayer or any member of the taxpayer’s group. In addition, the Commissioner should be able to accept late elections, as recommended. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Determination G14B and foreign currency options Submission (74A – Deloitte) Determination G14B should be extended to include foreign currency options. Comment Determination G14B currently covers forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities. The economic characteristics of forward contracts are fundamentally different from options contracts. As such, it would not be appropriate to extend the scope of Determination G14B to cover foreign currency options. Options are rights, but not obligations, to buy or sell specified amounts of foreign currency or commodities at a fixed price, either at a fixed time (European options) or over a period of time (American options). Unlike forward contracts that represent obligations, options are rights which need not be exercised. For example, the holder is not obligated to exercise an option that has an intrinsic loss (that is, when the price stated in the option is less favourable than the market price at exercise date). Furthermore, options can be exercised at a particular date or any time over a period, whereas obligations under forward contracts must be met at a fixed date. Nevertheless, we agree that the tax treatment of options contracts needs further clarification. Under IFRS, options are accounted for based on fair value and this may not be appropriate for taxation purposes. The alternative legislative methods recommended earlier could apply to foreign currency options. Under the alternative method, a reasonable amount of income or expenditure, based on expected considerations, would be spread over the term of the options. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 14 Issue: Alternative methods to determinations Submissions (74R – Deloitte, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 49 – Contact Energy Limited, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposed alternative method to determination does not require a materiality criterion. The alternative method to determinations should not have to conform with “commercially acceptable practice”. Comment Alternative methods are accepted instead of the method(s) prescribed in determinations if they comply with certain conditions. The conditions proposed in the bill, which are based on existing rules, require that an alternative method: • has regard to the principles of accrual accounting; • conforms with commercially acceptable practice; and • results in the allocation to each income year of amounts that are not materially different from the method prescribed in the relevant determinations. The alternative method to determinations is not intended as a default method. From a policy perspective, it is intended that taxpayers who may not have applied the specific determinations in every way could be treated as complying with the determination method if the outcome of applying the alternative method is not materially different from the method(s) set out in a determination. Therefore, the key condition for this method is that it must result in an allocation that is not materially different from the determination method. Nevertheless, in the context of the expected value determinations listed in the bill, the requirement to conform with “commercially acceptable practice” could be difficult to apply under the IFRS financial reporting environment. This is because “commercially acceptable practice” would be dictated by IFRS and the IFRS treatment would, in most cases, be quite different from the methods provided by the determinations. It is recommended that this condition be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. 15 Issue: Application of the determination method to foreign-currency denominated financial arrangements Submission (Matter raised by officials) The ability to use appropriate determinations should be extended to foreign-currency denominated financial arrangements. Comment The bill includes an option for taxpayers to use a method set out in specific determinations instead of the IFRS fair value method. However, the scope of when taxpayers can elect to use this option needs to be expanded so that it covers foreign-currency denominated financial arrangements. For example, taxpayers with foreign-currency denominated financial arrangements are not required to fair-value the financial arrangements under IFRS. Instead, foreign exchange gains and losses on these financial arrangements are reported at prevailing market exchange rates, but technically they are not fair valued. These taxpayers should still be allowed to use the determinations for taxation purposes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 16 ELECTION INTO ALTERNATIVE METHODS Submission (65A – New Zealand Bankers Association) Taxpayers should be allowed to opt into the determinations anytime during the transition to IFRS-based rules and when IFRS accounting treatment changes. Comment There are some uncertainties around when taxpayers are allowed to elect into the determination methods. Taxpayers are transitioning to the IFRS-based financial arrangement spreading rules in the 2005–06, 2006–07 and 2007–08 income years as they adopt IFRS for financial reporting purposes. These taxpayers would be expected to use the IFRS methods or one of the alternative methods set out in the bill. They should be able to opt into these alternative methods at any time during the transition period, and the proposed bill should be modified to allow this. To provide certainty, this requirement should over- ride all election criteria that may be more strictly required by the specific determinations. Taxpayers who use the IFRS-based rules may change their accounting treatment as their circumstances change after the transition years. The bill also needs to provide certainty for these taxpayers to elect into the alternative methods allowed in determinations. We recommend that the bill be amended to allow taxpayers to opt into the methods set out in determinations or another alternative method if their IFRS accounting treatment has changed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 17 SPREADING RULES FOR SPECIFIC FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS Issue: Contracts for differences Submissions (80 – Rio Tinto, 74R – Deloitte, 49 – Contact Energy Limited, 46 – TrustPower, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Alternative methods are needed as taxation based on the fair value approach is not appropriate for contracts for differences. Comment The transition to IFRS has created a particular problem for the tax treatment of contracts for differences, the most typical examples of which are those used in the electricity industry. Under IFRS, these contracts are measured at fair value. Submissions have raised concerns that the IFRS fair value method is inappropriate for these instruments as they are typically used as hedges of future cash flows that are not in the tax net. Taxing these instruments on a fair value basis would also create significant practical problems because of volatility. Officials agree that the IFRS fair value method should not be compulsory for these contracts. It is intended that contracts for differences should be treated as forward contracts. Taxpayers that comply with the requirements set out in the alternative “expected value” method recommended earlier could apply that method to these contracts. Taxpayers should also be able to elect into the Determination G14B treatment or alternative to the determination method. However, there are uncertainties around whether these contracts are “forward contracts” as defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. One interpretation is that contracts for differences are not forward contracts because the underlying commodities under these contracts are never delivered. We recommend that the current definition of “forward contracts” be amended to ensure that contracts for differences are covered. The consistency criteria in Determination G14B may be too restrictive for contracts for differences. The requirement to apply the same treatment for other forward contracts and foreign currency loans would not apply in this unique case as the contracts are typically used to hedge commodity prices that relate to the taxpayers’ ordinary business. We recommend that this consistency requirement be relaxed. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 18 Issue: Interest-free loans Submission (61 – KPMG) Alternative methods may be needed for interest-free loans as IFRS may require the loan to be recorded at its present value. Comment We agree there may be IFRS-related problems with such loans. For example, an interest-free loan from a parent to a subsidiary is classified as equity. Therefore, having tax follow the accounting treatment may be appropriate. If interest-free loans are characterised as equity, then it is not strictly within the scope of the financial arrangement rules. This would seem to produce an appropriate tax outcome. On the other hand, some of these loans may be treated as debt and discounted to present value. The difficulty then is determining the amount of interest, if any, that should be included for taxation purposes. The problems associated with interest-free loans are wider than the IFRS-related issues. Further work would need to be done to resolve these problems. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 19 HYBRID ARRANGEMENTS Submissions (95 – New Zealand Law Society, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 85A – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 74R – Deloitte, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 65A – New Zealand Bankers Association, 61 – KPMG, 54 – ASB Bank) The determinations dealing with the allocation of consideration between financial arrangements and excepted financial arrangements (Determinations G5C, G22 and G22A) should be retained. Comment Hybrid arrangements are arrangements that are part debt and part equity. Determinations G5C, G22 and G22A (which replaces G22) deal with these financial arrangements under the existing tax rules. These determinations deal with the separation of equity and debt components and how the income and expenditure of the debt component should be calculated. It is intended that these determinations would continue to apply under the proposed rules. Determinations G5C, G22 and G22A were issued under the authority of current section EW 6, which is not being amended by the proposed legislation. By implication, these determinations should continue to apply to taxpayers that adopt IFRS-based spreading rules for taxation purposes. Nevertheless, it may not be sufficiently clear that once a debt component is separated from the equity component, the income and expenditure of the financial arrangement component should be calculated using the determinations instead of IFRS. The proposed legislation should ensure that income and expenditure of a hybrid arrangement that is covered by determinations G5C, G22 and G22A continues to be dealt with under these determinations rather than IFRS. The IFRS treatment could be accepted as an alternative if the outcome is not materially different from the method set out in the determinations. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 20 FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS UNDER IFRS Submission (97 – Russell McVeagh) An equity instrument under IFRS can still be a financial arrangement for taxation purposes: • Section EW 15B(1) needs to contemplate this possibility and should read: “a person who is a party to a financial arrangement must use the IFRS method for that arrangement if the person uses NZ IAS 39, in respect of that financial arrangement, for the purposes of preparing the person’s financial reports”. • Section EW 22(d)(ii) also needs to contemplate this possibility with the proposed wording: “does not apply NZ IAS 39, in respect of income derived or expenditure incurred under that financial arrangement, for financial reporting purposes”. Comment The submission is predicated on the assumption that equity instruments under IFRS could fall within the definition of a financial arrangement for taxation purposes. However, it is not clear from the submission how this could be the case and no concrete example was provided. Officials agree that there is a possibility that a financial arrangement for taxation purposes could be treated as equity for accounting purposes. In this case, the IFRS method would not be appropriate. We recommend that an alternative method should be provided based on the existing yield to maturity method, rather than the solution proposed in the submission. If accepted, the overall effect of the submission is that taxpayers who prepare IFRS accounts would be allowed to use the default method under section EW 22, which is intended only for taxpayers who do not prepare IFRS accounts. This is clearly inappropriate from a tax policy perspective. Recommendation That the submission be noted and an alternative method based on yield to maturity should be provided. 21 LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS FOR SALE AND PURCHASE OF PROPERTY Issue: Determination G29 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section EW 15 should be clarified to confirm that existing Determination G29 should apply. Comment A property agreement in which the settlement is deferred is a financial arrangement. This type of agreement is within the financial arrangement rules if the deferral is for a significant period of time (more than 93 days). In these cases, the agreement contains a loan between the buyer and the seller. Interest income and expenditure (including any foreign exchange gains and loses) embedded in the agreement should be accrued for taxation purposes. The current tax treatment of agreements for the sale and purchase of property when the consideration is in foreign currency is governed by Determination G29. The determination interacts with a number of other provisions in the tax legislation to deal with the foreign currency components of deferred property settlement. Determination G29 approves the adoption of three alternative exchange rates for converting the foreign-currency denominated property price into New Zealand dollars. The rates are the spot rate on the rights date, spot rate on the contract date, or the spot rate on the payment date. These rates are in addition to the rates available under section EW 34 (namely, forward rate to rights date or forward rate to payment date). Determination G29 also prescribes the method for calculating income and expenditure based on the exchange rates used. We recommend that the methods set out in Determination G29 be preserved. An IFRS method would be accepted if it produces results that are not materially different from one of the methods prescribed under Determination G29. Recommendation That the submission be accepted 22 Issue: IFRS treatment or Determination G29 Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section EW 15 should be clarified to confirm that the IFRS accounting method supersedes existing Determination G29 even where no unrealised foreign exchange gain/loss is recognised in the profit and loss account/balance sheet for accounting purposes. Comment The submission suggested that one possible treatment for long-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property under IFRS is to recognise the prepayment as deposits at the prevailing spot rate. This treatment is inconsistent with the current rules in Determination G29 – where taxpayers are allowed to use different exchange rates, but using the prevailing spot rate is not one of the options. Recognising prepayments on long-term property agreements at spot rate is too simplistic and is inconsistent with the purpose of the financial arrangement rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: IFRS treatment for tax depreciation purposes Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The bill should be clarified to confirm that the tax depreciation base cost of fixed assets is equivalent to the accounting depreciation base cost adjusted for any foreign exchange movements which have previously been taxed or deducted. Comment The interaction between the value of property under the financial arrangement rules and for other tax act purposes (such as depreciation) is governed by section EW 35. This provision is outside the scope of the proposed amendments. We recommend that the existing approach under section EW 35 be preserved. However, as part of the normal tax policy work programme, officials will further consider whether the various IFRS treatments that could apply to these and other similar arrangements are acceptable for tax purposes. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 23 SHARED EQUITY MORTGAGES Submission (62 – Rismark International) Taxation rules inadvertently create a major barrier to the introduction of private-sector shared equity mortgages to the New Zealand market. Comment Shared equity mortgages or equity finance mortgages are essentially housing loans that have no interest repayment. Instead, the lenders receive a share of the change in the property value when the loan matures or when the loan is repaid. For example, a lender could provide initial capital of 20 percent, or $60,000, for a borrower to purchase a house that costs $300,000. No interest would be payable on this loan, but the borrower would have to share any capital gains or losses on the property with the lender. If the property value increases to $400,000 the lender will share in the $100,000 increase with the borrower. Under the Rismark products, the same lender will take a 2:1 payout, which is 40 percent in the same example. If the property value decreases, the lender and the borrower will also share the losses. In this case, the lender that provides 20 percent finance will share 20 percent of the losses. We also understand from Rismark that their products will be generally available to the public. Anyone interested in using shared equity mortgages could take up these mortgages instead of conventional mortgages offered by commercial banks. A number of taxation concerns could arise for the lenders and borrowers of these shared equity mortgages. Taxation of lenders For the lenders, current taxation rules require these mortgages to be taxed on a market value basis. Rismark has indicated that the product would not be commercially viable if taxes have to be paid on this basis. As tax liabilities are not matched to cash, Rismark says it would make the product difficult to securitise and they would have difficulties in attracting investors to supply funds for this product. Rismark has requested that shared equity mortgages be taxed on a cash-flow realisation basis. This means that the tax liability would occur only when the mortgages mature or are repaid. Rismark’s submission states that this is the tax treatment for their products in Australia. 24 Taxing these mortgages only when the loan matures or when the loan is repaid would be problematic under New Zealand’s taxation rules. The main problem is that allowing shared equity products to be taxed on a cash-flow realisation basis would essentially be providing a tax concession for this product over more conventional mortgages. It is difficult to predict what this tax concession is likely to do but one possible scenario is that shared equity mortgages could replace conventional mortgages, at least in some segments of the housing market. Taxing the income of lenders on a cash-flow realisation basis could also create adverse tax planning opportunities as lenders could deduct their funding costs for these mortgages on an accrual basis. Taxation of borrowers Although Rismark has not made a submission on the taxation of borrowers under a shared equity mortgage, some taxation concerns do arise for borrowers as well. Many borrowers of shared equity mortgages would not come within the tax net because the property would mostly be owner-occupied housing. However, under current taxation rules, income could arise for these borrowers if they repay less than the original loan amount when the property value has fallen. This is the case generally under current taxation rules when borrowers are relieved from repaying their loans in full or when the loan is remitted. In the case of shared equity mortgages, it would seem unfair for a tax liability to arise because any increase in economic wealth resulting from the loan remission is clearly offset by a decrease in the property value. If special rules were to be developed for these shared equity mortgages, more work would be needed to distinguish between these mortgages and other conventional housing loans. For products that are offered by Rismark, there is nothing to prevent the borrowers from using these mortgages to purchase rental property. Property could also be rented out temporarily, have fee-paying boarders, or be used as a home office. In these cases, there could be a problem in determining the interest expense that borrowers could claim against their taxable income. These and other issues would have to be worked through. Tax policy process Any taxation rules developed for shared equity mortgages would have wider implications and would need to be considered carefully. More analysis and consultation is required on the tax treatment of these products. The stakeholders (including banks and other financial institutions as well as Rismark and Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZC), which offers similar products) should be consulted. The Reserve Bank may also have a view on the tax treatment of this product. Officials recommend that as the issues raised by the submission are complex and have wider implications, further work should be done according to the generic tax policy process. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 25 CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS Issue: Consistent use of IFRS method across similar arrangements Submissions (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 65A – New Zealand Bankers Association, 23 – ISI) Different methods may be used for tax purposes as a result of different accounting methods being used under IFRS (for example, swaps entered into for different purposes) – this should be allowed. Comment Current tax rules require the same spreading method to be applied to all financial arrangements that are the “same or similar”. Officials agree that this requirement is too stringent under the IFRS-based spreading rules, as IFRS allows different methods to be used depending on the purpose of the financial asset. Even if the same method is prescribed by IFRS – for example, the fair value method – some instruments qualify as cash-flow hedges or hedges of a net foreign investment and can be reported differently for accounting purposes. In this case, it might be appropriate for taxpayers to use the IFRS fair value method for some instruments and the alternative spreading methods for the instruments that have been treated as cash- flow hedges or hedges of a net foreign investment. We recommend that different spreading methods be allowed for financial arrangements that are the same or similar for taxation purposes if the arrangements qualify for different accounting treatment under IFRS. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 26 Issue: Anti-arbitrage consistency requirements Submission (Matter raised by officials) Consistent spreading methods should be adopted for financial arrangements that are in a hedge relationship under IFRS. Comment Taxpayers can use IFRS methods or a number of alternative methods to spread their financial arrangement income and expenditure. These alternative methods are provided to ensure that taxpayers are not forced to apply the IFRS method. However, it would not be correct for disparate spreading methods to be used when the financial arrangements are part of a hedge relationship under IFRS. If this is allowed, taxpayers may be able to apply the IFRS method selectively to realise losses on one instrument, and to defer gains on the other instrument using an alternative method. We therefore recommend that taxpayers who adopt these alternative spreading methods must use similar methods (and must not use the IFRS market value or fair value-based method) to account for financial arrangements that are part of a hedged relationship under IFRS. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Consistent use of non-IFRS methods over time Submission (Matter raised by officials) Taxpayers who have elected to use one of the exceptions to IFRS should be allowed to revert to the IFRS method if a new method is used under IFRS which the taxpayer would like to follow for taxation purposes. Comment Under the proposed bill, taxpayers may elect to use an alternative spreading method that is not based on IFRS – for example, by using one of the determinations. In this case, taxpayers must use the spreading method over the financial arrangement’s entire term, unless they have a sound commercial reason for a change of method. 27 Taxpayers should be allowed to change the spreading method if their accounting treatment changes subsequently and they wish to follow the new IFRS method for taxation purposes. Alternatively, they may no longer meet the conditions set out in the alternative methods and need to revert back to the IFRS methods. We recommend that a change of method should be allowed in these circumstances. A change of method adjustment would be required in accordance with existing rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Change of method adjustment Submission (65A – New Zealand Bankers Association) Taxpayers should be required to perform the base price adjustment instead of a change of method adjustment when they change from the IFRS fair value method to an alternative spreading method. Comment Normally taxpayers that change their spreading methods are required to perform a change of method adjustment. The change of method adjustment brings the tax position of the taxpayers up-to-date as if the new method of spreading has been applied throughout the term of the financial arrangements. The submission proposes that a change of method adjustment could be replaced with the base price adjustment. At the point of change, taxpayers would treat the old financial arrangement as being realised, and a base price adjustment is calculated. The taxpayer would effectively be treated as having entered into a new financial arrangement and the new method would apply to the financial arrangement. The consideration paid for the new financial arrangement is the market value at the time the change of method takes place. A base price adjustment is more appropriate than a change of method adjustment when a taxpayer is moving from the fair value method under IFRS to an expected value approach (say under G14B). The change of method adjustment would reverse all the market value movements in previous years, recalculate the income and expenditure under the new method and require the difference to be included for taxation purposes in the year of adjustment. If the new method does not require any income or expenditure to be spread, then the change of method adjustment would allow all previous gains and losses to be reversed in the year the change of method occurs. This may create opportunities for tax avoidance. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 28 Issue: Interaction between the determination method for IFRS and non- IFRS taxpayers Submissions (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 65A – New Zealand Bankers Association) Interaction between the IFRS method and the alternative methods is unclear. A taxpayer applying the alternative method should be treated as continuing to apply the IFRS method for the purpose of consistency requirement. Comment The bill introduces a number of spreading methods for taxpayers who prepare IFRS accounts. These methods are the IFRS methods (either yield to maturity or fair value) and the methods set out in determinations and their alternatives. New spreading methods are also recommended, as discussed earlier, so that taxpayers are not forced into the IFRS fair value treatment. All these methods are different in scope, application and effect. The legislation will clarify that IFRS methods are in fact not the same as the methods set out in determinations. However, taxpayers will be allowed to change from one method to the other, in some circumstances, as explained earlier. A change of method adjustment or a base price adjustment would be required depending on the circumstances of this change of method. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 29 APPLICATION DATES Issue: Application dates Submissions (85A – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 74R – Deloitte, 54 – ASB Bank, 49 – Contact Energy Limited, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The IFRS-based rules should not become compulsory until 2008–09. Comment The proposed application date for the adoption of IFRS for taxation purposes is the 07–08 income year generally. This is because taxpayers who adopt IFRS for accounting purposes should do so at the same time for taxation purposes. As the adoption of IFRS is compulsory from 1 January 2007, the adoption of IFRS for tax purposes would not be later than the 2007–08 income year, except for a small group of taxpayers as discussed below. The alignment between adoption of IFRS for accounting and tax purposes would ensure that taxpayers do not have to prepare two sets of accounts. Any transitional adjustment that could arise from the adoption of IFRS would also be dealt with at the same time. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Application dates for taxpayers with an early balance date Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Taxpayers with early balance date (between 1 October and 30 December) who are not early adopters for financial reporting purposes can only apply the new rules from the 2008–09 income year. Comment The submission points out that taxpayers with an early balance date (between 1 October and 30 December) who are not early adopters would not be able to comply with the proposed IFRS-based rules in the 2007–08 income year. This is because they would not have adopted IFRS for accounting purposes in their 2007–08 income year, as the accounting period for the 2007–08 year begins before 1 January 2007. For this group of taxpayers, the application date of the proposed rules would have to be the 2008–09 income year. 30 Recommendation That the application date be extended to the 2008–09 income year for taxpayers with an early balance date (between 1 October and 30 December) who are not early adopters of IFRS for financial reporting purposes. Issue: Grandparenting provision should be extended until the 2008–09 income year Submissions (74R – Deloitte, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 54 – ASB Bank, 49 – Contact Energy Limited, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The old financial arrangement rules should be allowed and the new rules should not become compulsory until the 2008–09 income year. Comment The grandparenting provision in the bill allows the old financial arrangement rules to be applied until 2007–08 income year, even if the taxpayer was an early adopter of IFRS. These deferred application dates are provided because significant changes are proposed to the financial arrangement rules in the bill. Early adopters of IFRS should be allowed to use the old financial arrangement rules even though they have adopted IFRS for accounting purposes in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 income years. It is expected that the bill will be enacted in time for the 2007–08 income year, although that is somewhat later than would be ideal. Officials believe that the certainty advantage being sought is achieved with the other amendments being proposed, and that the costs of the suggested deferral are unnecessary. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 31 Issue: Retrospective application date Submissions (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 61 – KPMG) For early adopters, the application date should be aligned if taxpayers have filed their income tax return based on IFRS. Comment The current early adoption proposals already allow taxpayers sufficient flexibility. This is because they have the choice of whether or not to adopt IFRS for their financial arrangements. The other proposed IFRS changes are technical but in general are taxpayer friendly. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Drafting of provision Submissions (74R – Deloitte, 54 – ASB Bank, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The grandparenting provision does not work properly because section EW 21 (and other methods under the old financial arrangement rules such as alternatives to YTM and determinations or the market value method) still requires the same method to be used for financial reporting purposes. Comment It is intended that the old financial arrangement rules be preserved during the grandparenting period. The submissions point out that some of the methods under the old financial arrangement rules require taxpayers to use the same method for financial reporting purposes. Given that taxpayers have already transitioned to IFRS for accounting purposes, it would not be possible to apply the same method as that prescribed under the old financial arrangement rules. Section EW 23 already outlines the circumstances where it is not necessary to adhere to the same method for financial reporting purposes. To be clear, it may be necessary to list the grandparenting period as a reason for not having to adhere to the requirement to use the same method for financial reporting purposes. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 32 Issue: Grandparenting and consistency requirement Submissions (74R – Deloitte, 54 – ASB Bank, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Taxpayers should not breach the consistency requirement if there is a change of method required at the end of the grandparenting provision. Comment Taxpayers who rely on the grandparenting provision would be using the old financial arrangement rules and the associated methods. Transitioning to IFRS-based spreading rules at the end of the grandparenting period may require a change of spreading methods. It is necessary to ensure that taxpayers can change their spreading methods at the end of the grandparenting period without breaching the consistency requirement. We recommend that the bill be amended to provide this certainty. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 33 TAX TREATMENT OF FEES Issue: Scope of fees to be spread under the financial arrangement rules Submissions (74R – Deloitte, 54 – ASB Bank, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Expenditure from certain fees should be deductible immediately, even if they are spread for financial reporting purposes, including fees: • for evaluating the creditworthiness of the borrower; • for obtaining legal advice; • for preparing and processing documents, closing the transactions; and • paid to a third-party broker for bringing a new customer. If the fee is also to be spread for taxation purposes, then additional income arising from this should be spread over three years. Alternatively, changes should be elective at this stage. Comment The bill proposes that fees that are non-integral to financial arrangements will be ignored when calculating income or expenditure under the financial arrangement spreading rules. This is intended to align the fees treatment under the financial arrangement rules with the IFRS spreading method. However, this intention might not be fully reflected in the proposals in the bill. The effect of this alignment is that any fees that have been spread under IFRS will be spread for taxation purposes. As noted below, some transaction costs are included as effective yield under IFRS and spread for financial reporting purposes. There are two reasons for this approach. First, the move to more reliance on IFRS timing rules pre-supposes that the IFRS timing rules produce a good reflex of income. If spreading some costs associated with a financial arrangement achieves this under IFRS, then it is not clear why it would not be a good policy to follow this practice for taxation purposes. Second, an alignment between tax and accounting rules would reduce compliance costs (although we note that, in general, taxpayers would rather incur more compliance costs if that is going to accelerate deductions). Taxpayers who adopt IFRS spreading methods for taxation purposes would not be required to identify different types of fees that have been included in the IFRS calculation and deal with them individually for taxation purposes. 34 The submissions appear to be referring to fees that are spread under IFRS. It is true that for a number of taxpayers an alignment with IFRS treatment may result in a change of timing for the deduction of fees. Rather than an “up front” deduction, fees will require spreading and be deductible over time. Taxpayers who adopt IFRS spreading methods may thus find that their tax treatment of fees associated with financial arrangements has changed. Taxpayers who do not adopt the IFRS method would only be required to spread contingent fees, as they do currently. The proposed rules also do not change the tax treatment of fees more generally – for example, fees for services or other fees not related to a financial arrangement are not affected by the proposed legislation. However, we believe it should be clarified that for all fees associated with financial arrangements, their timing for taxation purposes should be the same as is used by taxpayer for financial reporting purposes. Recommendation That the submissions be declined, but that it be clarified that the tax treatment of all fees associated with financial arrangements be aligned to the actual financial reporting method. Issue: Interaction between fees and fair value method Submissions (74R – Deloitte, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) It is necessary to clarify that fees are recognised immediately if the underlying instrument is fair valued. Comment When a financial arrangement is fair valued under IFRS, fees that relate to the financial arrangement are recognised immediately as income or expenditure in the income statement. This treatment for fees is consistent with the fair value treatment of the financial arrangement, meaning that all market value gains and losses are recognised immediately. It would be consistent with the policy intention to allow the same treatment for taxation purposes. This is inherent in the proposals and should be clarified. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 35 Issue: Scope of fees to be spread under the financial arrangement rules Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The legislation should be clarified to say that both fees and transaction costs are to be spread over the life of a financial arrangement as per NZ IAS 39. Comment The bill proposes that fees that are non-integral to financial arrangements will be ignored when calculating income or expenditure under the financial arrangement spreading rules. The effect is that anything that has been spread under IFRS will also be spread for taxation purposes. The submission points out that some transaction costs that are directly attributable to a financial arrangement are spread as part of the effective yield calculation under IFRS. This accounting treatment should be accepted for taxation purposes. We agree that it would be consistent with the policy intention to accept the accounting treatment for transaction costs when taxpayers have adopted IFRS spreading methods. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Guidance for taxpayers who do not prepare financial reports Submission (74R – Deloitte, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) More guidance is needed on the meaning of “non-integral” fees for taxpayers who do not prepare financial reports. Comment The changes relating to fees only apply when IFRS financial statements are prepared. The concept of non-contingent fees would continue to apply to taxpayers who do not prepare IFRS financial statements. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 36 RELIEF FROM UNACCEPTABLE TAX POSITION PENALTY Issue: Scope of relief Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Relief should apply to taxpayers who follow the IFRS methodology in error on the mistaken assumption that because the old accounting rules are acceptable for tax purposes that IFRS methodology is also acceptable for tax. Comment Tax liabilities are generally calculated on the basis of income tax legislation rather than accounting standards. Even though tax rules do rely on accounting practice in a number of areas, the relationship between accounting practice and tax is complex. This is the case under the old accounting rules as well as under IFRS, although officials acknowledge that with the introduction of IFRS there is real tension in some areas between IFRS timing rules and historical tax rules. Taxpayers should be expected not only to take reasonable care when relying on accounting practice for taxation purposes but also to ensure that the reliance on accounting practice does not result in an unacceptable tax position. This is the requisite standard under the old accounting rules and should not be relaxed as taxpayers move to IFRS accounting rules. The proposed legislative relief from unacceptable tax position penalties is provided for early adopters of IFRS who may be filing their tax returns before the bill is enacted. This is intended as a narrowly targeted relief for these taxpayers in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 income years. It is anticipated that the legislation will be enacted before the 2007–08 income year and this would be adequate for most taxpayers, except for the few that have a very early balance date. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 37 Issue: Relief should be extended to the 2009–10 income year Submissions (74R – Deloitte, 49 – Contact Energy Limited, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Relief should be extended until the 2009–10 income year for all taxpayers. Comment The proposed legislative relief from unacceptable tax position penalties is provided for early adopters of IFRS who may be filing their tax returns based on IFRS as early as the 2005–06 income years. The proposed cut-off date for legislative relief is the 2006–07 income year because the legislation is expected to be enacted by the 2007–08 income year. We do not believe it is necessary to extend the application date of the proposed legislative relief. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Conditions for relief Submissions (74R – Deloitte, 49 – Contact Energy Limited, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Conditions that taxpayers have to satisfy to qualify for relief are not clear. In particular: • Why is the link to accounting treatment necessary? • What is “full disclosure”? Comment The proposed legislative relief from the unacceptable tax position penalty is linked to accounting treatment because a tax position can be taken on the basis of the tax legislation alone. This tax position may have nothing to do with the changes that might be brought about by the adoption of IFRS for taxation purposes. A taxpayer that took an unacceptable tax position in this situation should not be protected from the unacceptable tax position penalties. The objective of providing legislative relief from the unacceptable tax position penalty is to provide reassurance to early adopters of IFRS in circumstances when they rely on IFRS accounting practice for taxation purposes. The proposed relief would apply only if a tax shortfall arises because of actual or potential application of IFRS. 38 In addition, the accounting treatment that has been used for tax purposes (which gives rise to the tax shortfall) must be acceptable accounting practice under IFRS. This condition is necessary to ensure that the unacceptable tax position penalty is applicable if tax positions are taken on the basis of an unreasonable IFRS interpretation. The “full disclosure” requirement is not a condition that can be defined precisely and set in legislation. In principle, sufficient information needs to be provided to the Commissioner so the Commissioner is in a position to assess the IFRS-related tax position. What constitutes full disclosure would vary depending on circumstances. For example, a taxpayer who provides a tax adjustment schedule listing an aggregate amount representing IFRS-related adjustment may be taken as full disclosure in some circumstances. More detailed information may be required in other circumstances. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application to the 2005–06 income year Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A number of taxpayers adopted IFRS in their 2005–06 income year. The relief needs to cover the 2005–06 income year for early adopters and the proposed legislation needs to be redrafted. Comment It is intended that the legislative relief be available for the 2005–06 income year, as well as the 2006–07 income years. The proposed section 141B(1B)(b) covers the period between the first day of the first income year that a taxpayer adopts IFRS and the last day of the 2006–07 income year. The policy intention is that, for a taxpayer who adopts IFRS in the 2005–06 income year, the legislative relief would cover both the 2005–06 and 2006–07 income years. The current provision in the bill already achieves this policy intention. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 39 IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS Issue: Deductibility of credit impairments Submissions (95 – New Zealand Law Society, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 65A – New Zealand Bankers Association) Tax deductions for bad debts should be aligned with credit impairments under IFRS. Comment The deductibility of bad debts for taxation purposes is entirely governed by the bad debt deductibility rules in section DB 23. General provisions for doubtful debts that have been recorded for financial reporting purposes are currently not deductible for taxation purposes. Bad debts are allowed as deductions only if they have been written off. An alignment between the IFRS treatment of credit impairments with the tax treatment would most likely reduce compliance costs of banks and financial institutions. It is also true that the credit impairment rules are more precise under IFRS than they have been under the old accounting practice. However, the credit impairment adjustments under IFRS are still only an accounting estimate. An alignment with IFRS in this area would essentially allow banks and financial institutions to treat the credit impairment estimate as deductible for taxation purposes. The revenue cost of such an alignment is also very significant. Initial estimates suggest that allowing credit impairments to be deductible for taxation purposes would cost, on a one-off basis, over $250 million if the rules apply to the four major banks. The costs would be higher if other financial institutions are taken into account. Further, consideration would have to be given to trade doubtful debts. On balance, we do not recommend an alignment with IFRS treatment. The present tax treatment for bad debts should not be changed. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 40 Issue: Scope of limitation on impaired credit adjustments Submission (65A – New Zealand Bankers Association) If impaired credit adjustments are not deductible, then it should be clarified that the credit impairment add-back adjustment only applies to a financial arrangement which is an asset. Comment The policy intention behind the credit impairment add-back is to ensure that taxpayers who adopt the IFRS methods are not using the methods as a “backdoor” to claim the credit impairment adjustment. Instead, the present tax treatment of bad debts should continue to apply for IFRS taxpayers. However, the proposed adjustment appears to be too wide, as it covers the impaired credit adjustment that could be made to financial liabilities as well as financial assets. From a policy perspective, the adjustment should only be necessary for financial arrangements that are financial assets. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 41 THIN CAPITALISATION RULES Submissions (74R – Deloitte, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Pre-IFRS asset values should be grandparented for the purpose of the thin capitalisation rules. Comment The current thin capitalisation rules have a safe harbour debt-to-asset ratio of 75 percent. This is generally understood to be a generous safe harbour. The adoption of IFRS may adversely affect a taxpayer’s ability to meet the safe harbour ratio. However, this would occur only if a large intangible asset (for example, goodwill) has to be removed from the balance sheet under IFRS. It may be appropriate to consider providing a special relief if taxpayers are in this position. Officials have discussed the impact of IFRS on the thin capitalisation rules with taxpayers as part of the consultation process leading up to the tax bill. To date, we are not aware of any taxpayer whose thin capitalisation position would be significantly adversely affected by the adoption of IFRS. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 42 TAX ADJUSTMENT FOR MOVEMENTS IN EQUITY RESERVES Issue: Movements in equity reserves Submission (49 – Contact Energy Limited) What mechanism is in place to adjust for items recycled from equity through the income statement if they have been recognised in tax calculations in an earlier year? Comment An accounting adjustment which transfers an amount from equity reserves to income statement should not in itself create any tax consequences. If the accounting record is relied upon for taxation purposes, this adjustment should be removed for tax purposes. However, such an accounting record is likely to be triggered by a realisation event – for example, when the financial arrangement matures. The financial arrangement rules provide that a base price adjustment is required when a financial arrangement matures. This is not linked to the accounting treatment. If a base price adjustment is performed on a financial arrangement, the outcome should be brought in for taxation purposes. In practice, these adjustments are done through tax adjustment schedules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 43 REMEDIAL UNIT FOR PROBLEMS RELATING TO ADOPTION OF IFRS Submissions (74R – Deloitte, 65A – New Zealand Bankers Association, 54 – ASB Bank, 49 – Contact Energy Limited, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) A remedial unit should be established to deal with ongoing problems that may arise from the adoption of IFRS. Comment We recognise that the transition from current accounting practice to IFRS for taxation purposes does create uncertainties for taxpayers. The proposed bill is the first step towards dealing with these uncertainties. Resources are currently not available to establish a formal remedial unit. The officials involved in these proposals will monitor outcomes and will react as promptly as possible to any problems as they arise. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 44 AVAILABILITY OF IFRS STANDARDS Submission (95 – New Zealand Law Society) Accounting standards referred to in the tax legislation must be publicly available. Comment We agree that this would be the desired outcome. The relevant New Zealand accounting standards are currently available on the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA) website. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 45 DRAFTING ISSUES Issue: Heading of section EW 19 Submission (65A – New Zealand Bankers Association, 23 – ISI) “Choice among YTM, SL and MV methods” is a clearer heading. Section EW 19 should read, “If the person is not required to use the IFRS method under EW 15B, a person may...” instead of, “A person who...”. Comment Officials agree with this submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Unacceptable tax position penalty Submission (Matter raised by officials) Proposed section 141B(1C) could be redrafted as follows: – the word “wholly” in subparagraph (c) is redundant; – “due to application of IFRS” could be clearer instead of “due to accounting” in subparagraph (d). Comment The changes are necessary to better reflect the policy intention. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 47 KiwiSaver (Supplementary Order Paper) 49 OVERVIEW This section covers: • submissions on Supplementary Order Paper No. 130; • a number of additional matters identified by officials; and • two late submissions (100 – Alzheimers Wairarapa Inc and 101 – New Zealand Absolute Return Association). Submissions relating to the design and administration of the member tax credit are still under consideration and will be provided to the Committee in due course. 50 WORDING IN SOP Submission (91 and 91A – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) NZICA supports the amendments made in SOP No. 130, however it considers that the opening wording of section KJ 3 could be improved. It is also concerned with the clarity of the language in new section KJ 4(3)(b). Comment Officials agree that the current wording and language used in sections KJ 3 and KJ 4 of the SOP should be amended for greater clarity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 51 PROCESS Submission (23A – Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc) As many of the issues raised in submissions on the main bill and the SOP relate to the efficient and practical administration of schemes from 1 October 2007, consideration should be given to speeding the passage of the bill to reduce the uncertainty that would otherwise result during the period from 1 October until the bill is passed. Comment Officials acknowledge the concern raised in the submission. The bill is expected to be reported back to the House by the Finance and Expenditure Committee by early November. It is the government’s intention that the bill will be enacted as soon as possible after the report-back to Parliament. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 52 SINGLE PROVIDER RULE Submission (101 – New Zealand Absolute Return Association) The single provider rule contained in section 53 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be abolished and instead, KiwiSaver investors be allowed to access a range of providers, with no more than 20 percent of their assets in any single provider. Comment Section 53 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 specifies that a person may be a member of only one KiwiSaver scheme at a time, but can have more than one account or investment product in any one scheme. The ability to invest in a number of investment products allows the member to diversify their investment and manage risk. The reason that the single provider rule was introduced was to avoid the proliferation of small accounts and to ease the administrative burden on Inland Revenue, as Inland Revenue needs to know which scheme a member is enroled in. This would not be possible if a member is allowed to join multiple schemes. Furthermore, the rule enables a member to more effectively track their accounts, thereby reducing the likelihood of lost accounts. The objective of diversification may be accomplished through the various products the KiwiSaver scheme subsequently invests in. Allowing access to multiple providers involves obvious costs and complexity for all parties in terms of administering the various components of KiwiSaver and ensuring there are no over- or under-payments of entitlements. A “20 percent” rule, as proposed, would require members to have at least five providers, and policing the rule would impose further compliance and complexity. It should also be noted that the regulatory arrangements for KiwiSaver schemes have been developed to be especially robust in light of the incentives to participate. The requirements relating to independent trustees and fees ensure that KiwiSaver schemes are subject to appropriate supervision and that investments are priced appropriately. This also helps mitigate any risk of having a single account with a provider. The decision to invest in KiwiSaver is an investment decision, which carries some investment risk. Members should assess these risks and choose an option that best suits them. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 53 EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS Submission (99 – Alzheimers Wairarapa Inc) Employer contributions should be either exempt or the employer tax credit raised to $30 per week per employee for all non-profit organisations with charitable status. Comment Exempting a particular class of employer from the compulsory employer contribution would be unfair on employees. Likewise, providing a higher level of tax credit for these employers would be unfair to other employers and, if the credit was not reflected in contributions to employees, would in effect be an additional subsidy to those employers with no countervailing increase in service levels. The tax credit reimburses employers for contributions that they are required to make, up to a maximum of $20 a week for each employee. The following table shows the maximum annual gross salary or wages covered by the tax credit: From Compulsory employer contribution as a percentage of gross salary or wages Maximum annual tax credit available Annual gross salary or wages completely offset by the value of the employer tax credit 1 April 2008 1% $1,040 $104,000 1 April 2009 2% $1,040 $52,000 1 April 2010 3% $1,040 $34,667 1 April 2011 4% $1,040 $26,000 Based on these figures, the effect on community organisations is unlikely to be significant before 1 April 2009 at the earliest. Funding agencies, such as the Ministry of Social Development, are aware that providers of community-based services have concerns about meeting the difference between the compulsory employer contribution and the tax credit. Agencies have undertaken to report to Ministers by the end of this year on the options for addressing the funding concerns of community and voluntary organisations and other similar bodies in the medium-term. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 54 APPLICATION OF SECTION 153 OF THE KIWISAVER ACT AND REGISTRATION AS A PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ENTITY Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 153 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be amended so that KiwiSaver schemes registered under an umbrella superannuation scheme trust can be treated as separate for the purposes of the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules. Comment Under the KiwiSaver Act a KiwiSaver scheme can be established under the umbrella trust deed that also governs a registered superannuation scheme. A number of KiwiSaver schemes have established themselves under this mechanism, including a default provider. Section 153 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 treats the umbrella trust, the registered superannuation scheme and the KiwiSaver scheme as the same entity for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The purpose of the provision was to ensure that no tax implications arise upon establishment of KiwiSaver schemes and on the transfer of assets between a registered superannuation scheme and the KiwiSaver scheme. A concern has been raised that this provision prevents a registered superannuation scheme and a KiwiSaver scheme from registering as separate portfolio investment entities. It is understood that separate registration may be desirable for compliance and risk-management purposes, such as ensuring that the KiwiSaver scheme portfolio investment entity eligibility is not dependent on the registered superannuation scheme. A default KiwiSaver scheme is required to be a portfolio investment entity. Officials consider that section 153 should be amended to exclude the portfolio investment entity rules from the application of this provision. This would allow the KiwiSaver scheme to register as a portfolio investment entity in its own right if it meets the eligibility criteria. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 55 APPLICATION OF SECTION NC 15(8) OF THE INCOME TAX ACT TO THE KIWISAVER ACT Submission (Matter raised by officials) The KiwiSaver Act and the employer tax credit rules should be amended so that reference to “PAYE period” relates to a filing requirement that an employer has under the PAYE rules. Comment The term “PAYE period” is defined in the KiwiSaver Act and the employer tax credit rules as having the same meaning as in section NC 15(8) of the Income Tax Act. The term “PAYE period” in this section only applies to large employers, specifically the periods from the 1st to the 15 th of the month and the 16 th to the end of the month that dictate their twice-monthly payments. The 1st to the 15 th of the month and the 16 th to the end of the month periods do not apply to small employers. To better reflect the policy intent, officials consider that the KiwiSaver Act and the employer tax credit rules should be amended so that reference to “PAYE period” relates to a filing requirement that an employer has under the PAYE rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 56 OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS THAT COUNT Issue: Double-dipping Submission (87 and 87A – ASFONZ) The proposed changes in SOP No. 130 do nothing to alleviate employer concerns over the possibility of legislatively sanctioned double-dipping by employees in respect of employer contributions towards employees’ retirement. The blanket exclusion from double-dipping proposed for any employee who is a Member of Parliament, a judicial officer, or a sworn member of the Police should be extended to every employee. Therefore, the “other contributions” definition could end before the four listed conditions. Paragraph 230(A)(2) should be amended to accommodate any employer unable to prevent compulsory employer contributions increasing their employer contributions in relation to a “class of employees”. Comment Volume 2 of the Officials’ Report recommends a number of changes to the “other contributions” provisions of the bill (see pages 22, 30, 33 to 35, 39 to 40 and 41). These changes aim to alleviate the concerns of employers currently making contributions to registered superannuation schemes to reduce the risk of double- dipping. Specifically, the Report recommends the replacement of the immediate vesting requirement with a requirement that for any employer contribution to count as a compulsory KiwiSaver contribution, the contribution must vest within five years (which is considered the “norm” for many existing schemes). Further, the Report also recommends the extension of the employment conditions to encapsulate any collective agreements finalised before 17 May 2007. The presumption underlying the policy is that, over time, employers will be able to further reduce the risk of double-dipping through remuneration bargaining with new employees to accommodate the new savings environment. The proposed amendment to clause 230(A)(2) aims to alleviate concerns about double-dipping in relation to specific situations when employer and employee do not have the same bargaining flexibility. Members of Parliament, judicial officers, and sworn members of the Police are excluded, as their terms and conditions are set by third-parties (the Remuneration Authority) or potentially under binding arbitration. The proposed amendment also allows for regulations to be made to cover other classes of employee (both public and private) in similar situations. Officials note that it is unlikely to apply to the private sector. 57 Recommendation That the concerns of employers and the corresponding recommendations in Volume 2 of the Officials’ Report be noted. That the submission on removing all requirements for the “other contributions” test and clause 230(A)(2) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 be declined. 58 COMPLYING SUPERANNUATION FUNDS Issue: Lump sum withdrawals Submission (87 and 87A – ASFONZ) The proposed change to clause 144 allowing members to require withdrawals for complying superannuation funds to be paid as a lump sum is superfluous. Relief is required to imply the lump sum withdrawal conditions into the terms of any complying superannuation fund trust deed and related disclosure document in existence when the date the bill comes into force. Comment The purpose of the proposed change to clause 144 relating to members being able to require withdrawals for complying superannuation funds to be paid in a lump sum is to ensure that complying superannuation funds do not lock members into the purchase of annuities. This makes complying superannuation funds more comparable with KiwiSaver. While officials recognise that many schemes already offer this facility, it is useful to note that some existing schemes do require the purchase of an annuity on reaching the age of entitlement. This will ensure that these schemes establish a lump sum withdrawal facility if they seek to establish complying fund status. The submission has also recommends that, to ensure that no existing complying funds are rendered non-compliant on enactment of the bill, it would be useful to have the requisite term implied into all complying fund trust deeds, to apply irrespective of anything in the trust deed to the contrary. Officials believe that this will be a prudent measure. Recommendation That the terms relating to withdrawal lump sums be implied into all complying fund trust deeds, to apply irrespective of anything in the trust deed to the contrary, and that the rest of the submission be noted. 59 Issue: Participation agreements Submission (87A – ASFONZ) The key policy objective of a member needing to lock in savings until retirement is more simply addressed by removing the requirement for participation agreements altogether. Comment The submission notes that while there is no particular concern with the filing of participation agreements, the key objective of lock-in can better be served by removing any requirement for participation agreements. This would require the lock- in provision to be included in the trust deeds. Lodgement of the participation agreement provides assurance to the government that employers providing access to complying funds provide access on the terms determined as necessary by the legislation. It creates greater transparency about the design of such schemes and ensures that they are aligned with the design of KiwiSaver. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Annual reports Submission (87 and 87A – ASFONZ) The requirement for additional annual report content should be reworded so that there is an obligation placed upon trustees to provide a summary of changes to any participation agreement to members covered under the relevant participation agreement, with the trustees required to provide a full set of these summaries to the Government Actuary when forwarding the full annual report. Comment This is already current market practice. The proposed amendment to the Superannuation Schemes Act cements this practice by requiring schemes to provide supplementary reports to the annual reports to members affected by the change, and a full set of amendments to the regulator. This is necessary because of the added tax incentives provided to KiwiSaver schemes, and ensures ongoing compliance with the complying superannuation fund criteria. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 60 Issue: Person with employment income opting in Submission (Matter raised by officials) Clarification is required for persons with employment income that choose to opt in. Comment The policy intent of the opting-in rules is that if a person is receiving salary or wages, the person is required to have KiwiSaver contributions deducted from their salary or wages. The intention is that the same rules will apply to a self-employed person who earns a salary or wages. To provide some flexibility, an employee can nominate which employer this opt-in relates to if the employee has two or more jobs. In addition, deductions are required to be made from any new employment started after opting in. Officials are aware of a couple of instances where a self-employed person with employment income who is opting in via a provider is contending that a self- employed person with employment income can opt in as a self-employed person only and that KiwiSaver contributions are not required to be deducted from their current salary or wage income. Officials consider that the policy intent is reflected in the current legislation as there is a requirement for persons opting in via a provider to specify the name of the employer if the person is an employee. However, to remove any doubt, officials recommend that the legislation be clarified to ensure that if a person is opting in and that person is an employee, then KiwiSaver contributions are required to be deducted from their salary or wages. It is recommended that the amendment apply from the date of assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 61 Issue: Definition of “salary or wages” and ACC weekly compensation and paid parental leave Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “salary or wages” in section 4 of the KiwiSaver Act should be amended to clarify that ACC weekly compensation and paid parental leave are treated as salary or wages for the purposes of KiwiSaver. Comment The definition of “salary or wages” in the KiwiSaver Act as it relates to ACC weekly compensation and paid parental leave creates an interpretation issue. This is because the definition of salary or wages excludes payments that are treated as income under section CF 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 (which includes paid parental leave and ACC weekly compensation). However, the definition used by the KiwiSaver Act specifically includes these payments as salary or wages. The policy intent is that ACC weekly compensation and paid parental leave are to be treated as salary or wages for KiwiSaver purposes as KiwiSaver deductions are required to be made if a recipient is a KiwiSaver member, but only if the recipient requests deductions to be made. Receiving ACC weekly compensation and paid parental leave is not treated as new employment for the purposes of the KiwiSaver Act. Officials consider that exclusion from the definition of “salary or wages” for payments that are treated as income under section CF 1 of the Income Tax Act should be clarified so that the exclusion does not apply to ACC weekly compensation or paid parental leave. This would remove any doubt over the application of KiwiSaver to ACC weekly compensation and paid parental leave. The proposed amendment should apply from 1 July 2007. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 63 Other matters 65 MINOR TECHNICAL DRAFTING CHANGES Submissions (Matter raised by officials) Officials have identified three minor technical drafting matters not dealt with elsewhere in the Officials’ Report. The drafting of proposed changes to the final calculation of Working for Families Tax Credits when payments have been made in interim instalments, overlooked the need to subtract parental tax credits received. Consequently, a small technical adjustment to a formula in section KD 7A(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 is required to correct the oversight. Drafting for the proposed inclusion of the fair dividend rate rules to qualifying assets in the calculation of a life insurers’ policyholder base tax only considered the situation of direct investment or investment in a portfolio investment entity. The drafting inadvertently omitted instances where life insurers invest into a portfolio investment entity, which in turn invests into another a portfolio investment entity or entities, including those in lower tiers of the investment chain. This omission should be rectified. It is also currently proposed that funds held for unit-linked life policies may adopt certain aspects of the portfolio investment entity rules in calculating its life insurance tax liabilities. However, to remove a potential ambiguity of interpretation, the current drafting needs to clarify that funds held for unit-linked life policies qualify for the proposed rules as part of the life insurer, and not as a person separate from the life insurer. Comment These minor technical changes are necessary to ensure that the proposed legislation reflects the policy intent. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 66 DEFINITION OF “DEPRECIABLE PROPERTY” Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section EE 7 of the Income Tax Act 2004 should be amended to ensure that all items listed in Schedule 17 fall within the definition of “depreciable property”. Comment The submission is outside the scope of the bill. There is an established process for the handling of alleged unintended changes as the result of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. This requires persons who consider that the rewrite process has resulted in an unintended change to refer the matter to the Rewrite Advisory Panel for its consideration. Recommendation That the submission be declined.

It is impractical for providers to require this information from all members and to change their systems to record the required history of residency. Major systems changes would also be required to enable calculation based on a member’s age and the number of days they are eligible. There is insufficient time for providers to make the required changes to their systems. These changes would also increase the complexity and cost of running KiwiSaver schemes. (Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc, ING) It is impractical to require providers to be “reasonably satisfied” about how many days during the credit year a person is eligible to receive the tax credit. Being “reasonably satisfied” is also open to interpretation. (Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc, ING, KPMG) The requirements that a provider be “reasonably satisfied” that a member meets the residence requirement and has “no knowledge that the person does not meet” the other requirements for claiming the tax credit create some uncertainty and also make compliance more difficult for fund providers. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) We support the clarification provided under the SOP in relation to the timing of eligibility for member tax credits. (ASFONZ) Fund providers will need to set up additional systems to identify members who join before 1 October 2007 and contribute before 31 October from those who join before 1 October but do not contribute before 31 October. These systems will then become obsolete. The substantial additional administrative burden that this requirement will cause for fund providers is out of proportion to the benefit for the government of preventing a limited number of people from paying $1,042.86 in June 2008 and receiving member tax credits for a full year rather than one month. SOP No. 130 should be amended to create one rule for determining the member credit start date. (Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc) Eligibility should be based on the member’s status on the last day of the tax credit year (30 June). (Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc, ING, ASB) 5 Where a member has contributed $1,040 at any time over the year, the member should be entitled to the full tax credit of $1,040. Contributions should not be apportioned according to membership. The result will be that a person will not receive the full $1,040 in the year of joining or leaving KiwiSaver, despite contributing $1,040 or more. The full member tax credit should be available to all members in the year they join, irrespective of when in a member credit year they choose to join KiwiSaver. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Members should be required to inform fund providers that they meet the requirements of the member tax credit and providers should be able to rely on the information. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Members should be required to advise providers of any change in eligibility and providers should be able to rely on the last advice received from members. (Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc, ING, ASB, KPMG) As Inland Revenue could potentially hold eligible contributions that have not yet been paid to the provider, some members will not receive their full credit if Inland Revenue does not consider the contributions they hold. (Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc, ING, ASB) Inland Revenue should be furnished with a statement detailing sufficient information to enable it to calculate the member’s tax credit for the year (rather than the provider calculating it). This would include eligible contributions received directly by the provider, details and rules of any mortgage diversion facility in place for the member, the member’s date of birth and the member’s residency status as at 30 June. (Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc, ING, ASB) The calculation of the member tax credit should be undertaken by Inland Revenue rather than the fund provider. Accordingly, the provisions in SOP No. 130 regarding fund provider claims for member tax credits would be unnecessary. (Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc) The processes for fund providers to claim member tax credits are complex and costly to implement. The most efficient approach to determining claims across the whole KiwiSaver scheme is for the calculation process to be consolidated with Inland Revenue in its role as central administrator, and with providers supplying supporting information. (Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc) Comment To be eligible for the member tax credit an individual must: • be a member of KiwiSaver or a complying superannuation fund; • be aged between 18 years and the age of eligibility for fund withdrawal (the age entitlement of New Zealand Superannuation – age 65 – or five years of membership, whichever is the later); and 6 • have their principal place of residence in New Zealand, unless he or she is an employee of the State services working outside New Zealand, or working overseas as a volunteer or for token payment for a charitable organisation named in the Student Loan Scheme (Charitable Organisations) Regulations. In claiming the credit the provider must: • be reasonably satisfied of the number of days in the member tax credit year 1 in which the person meets the residency requirement; and • have no knowledge that the person does not meet the other requirements. Officials’ consider that providers will hold the information necessary to satisfy themselves that a member meets the requirements relating to membership, age and withdrawal of accumulated interest. For providers to be satisfied as to the member’s principal place of residence, the policy is that providers should rely on the information that they receive, or hold, in order to determine eligibility. This means providers should be able to rely on the last address they receive or hold for the member. If a member’s principal place of residence is overseas, and the provider has not been informed, or does not hold any information that would indicate that the member is living overseas, the provider would be considered to have met the test. However, officials would envisage that when sending annual information to members, the provider would request whether the current address was the member’s principal place of residency. Because there is a risk that members will not inform providers that their permanent place of residence is no longer in New Zealand, the KiwiSaver Act requires that upon application for withdrawal, members are required to sign a statutory declaration stating the periods for which their principal place of abode is New Zealand. The member tax credit could then be clawed back if they have received it for a period for which they are not entitled. The member tax credit is designed to encourage people to join KiwiSaver and establish a saving habit. The credit is based on a maximum of $20 per week of membership. Supplementary Order Paper No. 130 ensures that, for the purposes of the member tax credit, persons are treated as members of KiwiSaver from either the 1st of the month in which contributions are deducted from their salary or wages or the 1st of the month in which securities are allotted by a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund. A transitional rule will apply as a result of the legislative requirement that all contributions must be paid to Inland Revenue during the period 1 July to 30 September 2007. This transitional rule will treat membership as beginning on the 1st of the month in which a provider receives a valid membership application form if contributions are received by either Inland Revenue or the provider during the period 1 July to 31 October 2007. 1 “Member credit year” means a year beginning on 1 July and ending on 30 June. 7 Extending the full member tax credit to all members in the year they join, irrespective of when in the year they join fundamentally alters the design of KiwiSaver. The design alters from one that encourages a person to be a member as soon as possible and develop a regular savings habit, to one where a person should join on the last day of the member tax credit year and make a lump sum payment, which is much more likely to favour those on higher incomes. Such a change would also result in a significant fiscal cost with little or no positive impact on individual or national savings levels. To alleviate the administrative burden on KiwiSaver fund providers in identifying the membership start date for the purposes of calculating the member tax credit for each member, Inland Revenue will use information from employers and scheme providers to calculate the appropriate member tax credit start date for each member. This means that information held by Inland Revenue relating to contributions deducted and provided by fund providers (as part of the information they are required to forward to Inland Revenue when a person joins KiwiSaver directly) will be used for the purposes of the member tax credit. The bill, as introduced, requires that contributions must have been received by the KiwiSaver scheme or complying fund provider in the member credit year (1 July to 30 June) to count towards calculation of the credit. (This provision will continue for complying superannuation funds as all contributions are made directly from the employer to the provider.) However, this would mean that contributions held by Inland Revenue but not received by the provider in that year would not count. Changes proposed in Supplementary Order Paper No. 130 will allow contributions received by Inland Revenue, but not paid to the provider until after the end of the member credit year, to be treated as contributions received by the provider in that year for the purposes of the member tax credit. Supplementary Order Paper No. 130 also allows supplementary claims for these contributions to be made by providers. This allows providers to claim for earlier periods if they obtain information needed to make a claim – either where no claim was previously lodged, or where less than the maximum eligible claim has previously been paid. To minimise the need for supplementary claims, providers have indicated a preference to claim based on the contribution information they hold at 30 June and for Inland Revenue to then add any qualifying contributions held and calculate and pay the credit on the total. Officials have met with provider representatives to develop the claim process further. Officials consider that a process can be developed along the following lines. Providers will be required to provide Inland Revenue with the necessary information, including information about residency, mortgage diversion, and payments received directly, so that Inland Revenue can compute the entitlement and make payment. This means that providers will not have to make supplementary claims. Officials consider the current wording of the legislation provides for this process as it requires that the claim must be “in the form prescribed by the Commissioner”. 8 Money held in the Inland Revenue holding account that may be taken into account for the purposes of calculating a person’s member tax credit will not be taken into account for the purposes of calculating the member tax credit until Inland Revenue has the necessary information in relation to mortgage diversion arrangements. To minimise delays, providers have indicated that they will provide information to Inland Revenue as soon as mortgage diversion arrangements are in place. KiwiSaver scheme providers will not be required to make supplementary claims for qualifying contributions received after the end of the member credit year (as provided in SOP No. 130). Providers would still be able to make supplementary claims if the claim is made for an earlier credit year and the tax credit has not previously been claimed. Because the process outlined above means that Inland Revenue will be collecting and storing member tax credit values paid, officials consider that this information will no longer be required to be sent by a provider to a new scheme on transfer. Details about the value of qualifying contributions received directly, mortgage diversion arrangements, any periods of ineligibility that are the result of residence outside New Zealand and the date on which a person first became a member of a KiwiSaver scheme will still need to be provided to another scheme on transfer. Recommendation That the submissions relating to contributions received and held by Inland Revenue but not on-paid to the provider until after the member credit year count as contributions for calculating the member tax credit for that year, be accepted. Note that the Supplementary Order Paper No. 130 allows contributions held by Inland Revenue to be counted in the calculation of member tax credits. That the submissions relating to Inland Revenue calculating the member tax credit be accepted so that the process for claiming the member tax credit is as follows: • Providers will forward necessary information regarding residency and mortgage diversion to Inland Revenue. • Inland Revenue will calculate the member tax credit based on this information. • Inland Revenue will make supplementary member tax credit payments as appropriate, when additional information is available in relation to money in the holding account. That the KiwiSaver Act be amended so that KiwiSaver providers are no longer required to provide information about the amount of the member tax credit received or information about previous claims made by them to a new KiwiSaver provider. That submissions to make the member tax credit available in full regardless of when in the year the member joins, provided the full qualifying contribution is made, be declined. 9 Issue: Member tax credit – timing of payment to providers and splitting of credit between providers Submissions (17 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 23 and 23A – Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 45 – Chapman Tripp, 47 – ING, 54 – ASB, 61 – KPMG, 91 and 91A – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) No timeframe is stated within which the payment needs to be made by Inland Revenue. There should be a timeframe in which the Commissioner must pay the credit to the provider. (Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc, ING, ASB, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The timing of the payment of a tax credit to one fund provider should not be determined by provision of information from all qualifying funds to which a member is contributing. A timeframe similar to the employer monthly schedule would ensure the member credit is delivered within the same timeframe as the proposed employer tax credit. (ASB) The arrangements for claiming the tax credits are complex. Mercer Human Resource Consulting supports tax credits paid to providers on a first-come basis rather than a KiwiSaver scheme having priority over complying superannuation funds. (Mercer Human Resource Consulting) Splitting between providers is impractical and will cause delays in payment, as Inland Revenue will wait to receive information from all providers. The member tax credit should first be paid to the member’s KiwiSaver account if they have one. Any balance should be paid to the member’s complying funds on a first-come basis until the annual limit is exhausted. (Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc, ING, Chapman Tripp) Comment Officials have grouped together submissions relating to the timing of the payment to providers and the splitting of credit between providers as the issues are inter-related. The member tax credit will be calculated and claimed on an annual basis (30 June). There is no timeframe on the payment to be made by the Commissioner as that would require a time limit “due date” on providers in terms of providing this information to the Commissioner. While the legislation allows for the Commissioner to set a due date upon which the claim needs to be furnished to the Commissioner, no timeframe has been set. This was considered the most flexible approach given that providers would be required to develop systems by July 2008 to claim the credit. It allowed the Commissioner to determine a date based on whether providers were able to submit claims so all claims could be made at the same time to allow pro-rating between providers. The rationale behind the pro-rata payment where a person has more than one fund provider was to treat all providers equally. 10 Officials accept that a timeframe would provide certainty for providers. Unlike the employer tax credit, the member tax credit is not linked to the PAYE remittance process. The employer tax credit is integrated with the PAYE remittance process to allow for the value of the credit to be given to employers at the same time the employer is required to remit the contributions to providers or Inland Revenue. The employer monthly schedule filing timeframes depend on the size of the employer. Requiring the member tax credit to be paid within the same timeframe as the employer tax credit would impose additional administrative costs on providers and Inland Revenue. We consider that an appropriate timeframe to process and pay the credit would be 30 working days after the Commissioner receives a claim from a provider (that is, 30 days after receipt of the necessary information to enable Inland Revenue to calculate the claim). The legislation currently provides that fund providers must furnish the claim on a date determined by the Commissioner. The reason for the due date was to ensure that each provider had the same opportunity to claim the credit for members who contribute to more than one scheme. Removing the pro-rating of the credit between the providers removes the need for a due date other than after the end of the member credit year. For simplicity, officials consider the credit should be paid to providers on a first- come, first-served basis. Furthermore, there should be no priority afforded to KiwiSaver over complying superannuation funds. To do so would require all claims by complying superannuation funds to be held pending the receipt of claims from KiwiSaver funds. Inland Revenue will ensure that a member’s tax credit for the year is limited to the lesser of the contributions made or the maximum credit for one year. Officials therefore recommend that the process for claiming and processing a member tax credit be as follows: • Claims for a member credit year (1 July to 30 June) are to be filed after 30 June (being the end of the member tax year). • Upon receipt of a claim, Inland Revenue has 30 working days to process and pay the claim to the provider. • Member tax credits are paid on first-come basis (that is, paid to the provider, whether it is a KiwiSaver or complying superannuation fund that first makes a claim for a member tax credit). Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, so that the process for claiming a member tax credit is as follows: • Claims for a member credit year (1 July to 30 June) are to be filed after 30 June (being the end of the member tax year). • Upon receipt of a claim, Inland Revenue has 30 working days to process and pay the claim to the provider. Member tax credits are paid on first-come basis. 11 Issue: Definition of “creditable membership” Submission (Matter raised by officials) SOP No. 130 includes a proposed change to ensure that savers will be eligible for the member tax credit from the date they begin making contributions. A definition of “creditable membership” is proposed, which effectively provides the start dates for eligibility to receive the member tax credit. Officials have identified that individuals who join via their employer and who also make a voluntary contribution directly to Inland Revenue (before deductions from their salary or wages begin) will not be eligible for the member tax credit until the date deductions from salary or wages begin. Comment Officials recommend that the proposed definition of “creditable membership” be amended to provide that when a person joins via their employer, the period of eligibility begins from the earlier of the date the first deduction is made from salary and wages or the date a voluntary contribution is received by Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 12 VESTING Submission (87 and 87A – ASFONZ) Two further options should be introduced to make the offset condition relating to the exclusion of specified superannuation contributions to existing superannuation schemes that are subject to vesting more equitable: • a similar rule to that used in section 25 of the KiwiSaver Act for exempt employer criteria should be introduced, whereby vesting scales of up to five years are permitted; or • paragraph (iv) should provide for an offset “to the extent that” specified superannuation contributions vest in the employee. Comment Officials have recommended a change to the vesting requirements in Volume 2 of the Officials’ Report for the other contributions test. Specifically, officials recommended that employer contributions that vest within five years may count towards the compulsory rate. This approach is consistent with the rules for exemption from automatic enrolment (an employer can only get an exemption if their contributions to the scheme vest within five years). The submission notes that an alternative approach may be to enable an offset, to the extent that the contribution vests within the employee. This approach would enable any employer contribution that is vested to count towards the compulsory rate (without requiring the full contribution to be vested). This approach aligns with the initial policy intent that vested contributions count towards the compulsory rate. Officials recommend that this approach be adopted for the proposed five-year vesting requirements, and that employer contributions to an existing superannuation scheme should count towards the compulsory rate, to the extent that the contributions are vested by the end of the fifth year. Note that officials have previously recommended (Volume 2 of the Officials’ Report, pages 39 and 40) that for the contribution to count towards the compulsory employer contribution it must vest within five years. The context of the comment was that all the contributions must be fully vested in their entirety within this time. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. That employer contributions to an existing superannuation scheme should count towards the compulsory rate, to the extent that the contributions are vested by the end of the fifth year. That the Committee note that this recommendation replaces the recommendation on page 40, Volume 2 in relation to the issue of vesting. 13 SUPPLEMENTARY ORDER PAPER 139: RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT DISCLOSURE Issue: Section numbering Submissions (102 – Chapman Tripp, 87B – ASFONZ) Section 205B should be renumbered as 205A, as there is precedent for a new section being inserted as an “A”. (Chapman Tripp, ASFONZ) The abovementioned provision maybe more appropriately included as section 209A, which is about the interface with Securities Law. (ASFONZ) Comment Officials agree that section 205B is more appropriately numbered as section 205A. Officials, however, consider that the provision fits more comfortably next to section 205 rather than section 209. This is because section 205 also requires information to be included in investment statements. Section 209, however, deals with potential liabilities under the Securities Act. Recommendation That the submission in relation to renumbering the provision as section 205A be accepted. That the submission in relation to the placement in the KiwiSaver Act be declined. Issue: “Activities” heading Submission (102 – Chapman Tripp, 87B – ASFONZ) The words “under the ‘Activities’ heading” in subsection (3) of section 205B should be deleted, as there is no requirement in the regulations for such a heading in the investment statement. (Chapman Tripp, ASFONZ) Comment The purpose of section 205B(3) is to enable the provider of a KiwiSaver scheme to know where the requirement for such disclosure should fit into the investment statement. The Securities Regulations prescribe information that must be contained in the investment statement. They also prescribe a number of headings that must be included in those statements. Other headings used in the Securities Regulations are used for illustrative purposes, and do not necessarily have to be included in the 14 investment statement. The “Activities” heading is one of the optional headings that can be used. Officials agree that the words “under the “Activities” heading” should be deleted, as this may cause confusion with the application of the optional headings in the Securities Regulations. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Best financial interests of members Submission (102 – Chapman Tripp) The proposed section 205B should be redrafted to enable schemes to adhere to their obligations to ensure that they are acting in the best interests of members. Proposed section 205B contained in the Supplementary Order Paper requires the inclusion in a scheme’s investment statement of one of two possible statements. However, both statements, if unqualified, potentially expose the scheme trustee to breach of trust actions and/or review of investment decisions. Comment The submission suggests that this disclosure requirement could conflict with the fiduciary duties of trustees, to act in the best financial interests of the scheme members. The trustee has an overriding duty to act in the scheme members’ best financial interests. When responsible investment considerations are relevant to the scheme’s expected financial returns, the trustee will be required to take these matters into account. However other (financial) considerations may outweigh the desirability of choosing a particular “responsible” investment or “responsible” investment strategy, over one that does not have those features. Trustees need the ability to explain that the overriding consideration is financial interests of the members, but to explain how responsible investment considerations can be taken into account within that constraint. It is argued that if unqualified, the prescribed statement may lead to potential breaches of trustee duties. Of the two statements set out in SOP No. 139 Chapman Tripp suggests that the statement in proposed subsection (2) must be qualified, while the statement in subsection (3) does not require qualification. However, it should be noted that a provider is always able to qualify this further in their investment statements if they choose to do so. Proposed section 205B only prescribes the minimum disclosure requirements. The requirement in subsection (2) is to allow providers to explain “the extent to which they take environmental, social and governance considerations into account”. It does not prescribe that any particular level of extent is required. 15 Officials suggest that acting in the best financial interests of the members and responsible investment are not necessarily mutually incompatible. To this end, a provider may choose, for example, to explain that while it takes responsible investment into account when establishing its investment policies, those policies are secondary to acting in the best financial interests of members. As such, a provider may give effect to both the best financial interests of members and a responsible investment strategy at the same time. Alternatively, providers may establish funds where responsible investment is an integral component of the investment strategy. It should also be noted that adopting either statement required by clause 205B would not expose a trustee to a breach of trust action, or at least put a trustee at risk of losing a breach of trust action as it is a good defence in law that the trustee acted in accordance with law. A provision of statute law imposing a duty on a trustee may in any event implicitly override any duty on a trustee imposed on him by the trust deed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The “tie breaker” principle Submission (102 – Chapman Tripp) Chapman Tripp suggests that one approach to responsible investment open to trustees is to adopt the “tie breaker” principle. The approach involves the trustee recognising that responsible investment considerations are non-financial, but that in a situation where the trustee can choose between two particular investments or investment strategies, one being a “socially responsible” investment and the other not, and the expected financial performance from each is the same, the trustee can be influenced by responsible investment considerations. If this approach is adopted, that could be explained in the further explanation given on the scheme’s website. Comment The current position in SOP No. 139 enables trustees to adopt this approach if they determine it is appropriate. Trustees may disclose in their investment statements that they have an approach to responsible investment, and refer members or potential members to their website for more information on how they implement the tie breaker approach. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 16 Issue: The ability to change approaches to responsible investment Submission (87B – ASFONZ) The nature of the provision may create confusion about trustees’ duty to act in the best interests of members. The proposed provision suggests that the decision in either direction about its investment policy is irrevocable and of indefinite application. This issue may be addressed if issuers of KiwiSaver schemes were able to flag in their investment statements that the approach being adopted at any point was applicable “as at the date of the investment statement”, and as such would enable the issuer to change their adopted approach. This approach would be further facilitated if issuers were able to include the information in a supplementary document to the investment statement. This would ensure that as approaches to responsible investment changed, issuers would not be faced with the costs of reprinting their investment statements Comment The submission suggests that, as trustee law clearly requires trustees to act in the best interests of beneficiaries of the scheme at all times, this must include a regular review of whether responsible investment is taken into account at any time. The drafting of the proposed section may suggest that the approach to the policy is irrevocable. ASFONZ suggests two possible remedies to this. They include enabling the issuer to include the relevant statements in a supplementary document to the investment statement or enabling the issuer to flag that the approach may be changed, by specifying that the approach was applicable “as at the date of the investment statement”. Officials agree that enabling the issuer to flag that the approach may be changed – by specifying that the approach was applicable “as at the date of the investment statement” – is desirable. However, officials do not consider that a supplementary document is appropriate. The primary reason for this is that the document would then fall outside the scope of the Securities Act and would not be subject to regulation by the Securities Commission. Recommendation That the submission be: • accepted in relation to issuers being able to specify that the approach was applicable “as at the date of the investment statement”; and • declined in relation to the use of supplementary documents. 17 Issue: Implementation date Submission (87B – ASFONZ) If an investment statement is dated before 1 April but is provided to a member of the public after 1 April 2008 and is accompanied by a separate document containing the relevant information in section 205B, it should be compliant with the provisions in section 205B. Similarly, if an application for subscription is made on the basis of an investment statement distributed before 1 April and does not comply with section 205B the subscription should be equally valid if a statement that is compliant with section 205B is sent to the investor within 14 days of subscription. Comment The submission has raised transitional issues relating to the introduction of the investment statement provisions in section 205B. The submission essentially enables schemes to maintain pre-existing investment statements, if the requirements in section 205B are included in a supplementary document. The current construction of the section provides flexibility for providers. The Securities Commission allows supplementary documents to be issued alongside their investment statements in certain instances. The proposed provision does not inhibit this discretion and continues to provide flexibility on the use of supplementary documents. It should also be noted that the Securities Commission will publish guidelines on how the relevant statements may be included in investment statements. The submission also suggests that a subscription made before 1 April should be validated if the investment statement distributed did not contain a section 205B- compliant statement, if a subsequent supplementary statement was provided. Officials’ view is that if the subscription is made before 1 April, then it is not bound to include the statement in section 205B. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 18 Issue: Application date Submission (87B – ASFONZ) It is understood that the proposed section 205B will come into effect from 1 April 2008. However, this date is not reflected in the current wording of the section. ASFONZ believes it would be helpful for both subsections (1) and (2) of proposed section 205B to start with “From 1 April 2008”. Comment Supplementary Order Paper No. 139 provides for a 1 April 2008 application date for the proposed new section 205B by amending clause 2 (16) of the bill which specifies the date that provisions in the bill come into effect, to include this provision. Clause 2 (16) deals with sections in the bill coming into force on 1 April 2008. Because of this officials consider it unnecessary to include the commencement date in the actual provision. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The requirement for a website Submission (87B – ASFONZ) There is no existing requirement for KiwiSaver scheme providers or complying superannuation fund providers to maintain a website. The effect of this provision may be to create such an obligation. The section should be re-drafted to recognise that a reference to the scheme website applies only if the scheme has a website. It is further suggested that this is more appropriately addressed by removing the requirement in section 205B(1)(a) completely. Comment Officials agree that it is appropriate for the legislation to recognise that some schemes may not provide access to a website. In these instances, it should be sufficient for people to request the information from the issuer free of charge. However, officials do not consider it appropriate to remove the obligation to provide access online, if the provider already has a website. 19 Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, so that the obligation to provide a reference to a website applies only when the issuer has a website that can be referred to. That the submission to remove the requirements of section 205B(1)(a) be declined. Issue: Inclusion of the disclosure of responsible investment for all securities Submission (87B – ASFONZ) Given the level of importance attached to responsible investment, the requirements in section 205B should not apply solely to KiwiSaver schemes, but rather to all securities. This may be achieved by amending the Securities Regulations 1983, rather than the KiwiSaver Act. Comment This is outside the scope of the bill. The government is currently examining the question in more detail and has established a Joint Working Party to develop some recommendations around responsible investment that have broader application. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 20 OTHER KIWISAVER TECHNICAL ISSUES Issue: Redraft proposed section 66A and Schedule 4 Submissions (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 45 – Chapman Tripp, 61 – KPMG, 74 – Deloitte, 87 – The Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section 66A and Schedule 4 require redrafting to enable their effective application. Apart from being difficult to interpret and requiring references to three different clauses of Schedule 4, the rules do not work properly. Comment Officials agree with the submissions that these provisions should be redrafted to enable them to work properly. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Application date for the proposed rules for invalid enrolments Submission (Matter raised by officials) In Volume 2 (KiwiSaver) of the Officials’ Report on submissions on the Taxation (Annual Rates, Business Taxation, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Bill, officials recommended a number of amendments to the KiwiSaver Act to deal with invalid enrolments (see pages 81 and 82). The submission did not specifically cover the issue of the application date of the proposed amendments. Comment Officials consider that the following options exist as the most appropriate application date for these proposed amendments: • date of assent of the bill; or • 1 July 2007 (the date KiwiSaver came into effect). 21 The date of assent option is prospective but creates a gap in terms of the administration of invalid accounts identified during the period 1 July 2007 to the date of assent. The proposed rules for invalid accounts will provide certainty for all the parties involved and will ensure that the person is put in the position that they would have been in if they had not been invalidly enrolled. Given this, officials consider that the proposed amendments apply from 1 July 2007, the date the KiwiSaver Act came into effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Provisions implying legislative terms into existing trust deeds Submission (Matter raised by officials) The provisions in the KiwiSaver Act and the bill which have the effect of implying terms in the legislation into existing trust deeds should be amended to clarify their application. Comment The KiwiSaver Act and the bill contain provisions that imply terms relating to the member tax credit and compulsory employer contributions into existing trust deeds that establish KiwiSaver schemes and complying superannuation funds. In addition, as part of drafting the rules for invalid enrolments to back-date validation, the terms relating to the invalid account rules will be implied into existing trust deeds. The provisions as drafted imply the respective law into the trust deed whereas it should be the terms (such as the definitions) used in the legislation. The relevant law will always apply despite any provisions in a trust deed. Officials therefore recommend that the relevant provisions be amended to clarify that they imply the legislative terms into existing trust deeds rather than the law. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 22 Issue: Notification to Government Actuary of subsequent payment Submission (Matter raised by officials) Proposed section 101I of the KiwiSaver Act should be amended to require a complying superannuation fund to notify the Government Actuary once payment has been received following the issue of a notice to an employer of a non-payment of compulsory employer contributions to the complying superannuation fund. Comment Proposed section 101I of the KiwiSaver Act deals with the non-payment of compulsory employer contributions and the actions that the Government Actuary must undertake to establish the amount of non-payment and the issuing of notices to employers and Inland Revenue. The current rules do not require a provider to notify the Government Actuary that a non-payment has been rectified following the issue of notice from the Government Actuary to an employer requiring the amount to be paid. Officials therefore recommend that proposed section 101I be amended to require a provider to notify the Government Actuary that an amount owing has been paid. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application date of proposed amendment to sections 215 and 216 to clarify which month the penalty applies from Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed amendment to sections 215(3) and 216(3) should apply from date of assent. Comment In Volume 2 of the Officials’ Report on submissions to Taxation (Annual Rates, Business Taxation, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Bill officials recommended that sections 215(3) and 216(3) be amended to clarify in which month the penalty is imposed (page 117). 23 Officials further recommended that the proposed amendments apply from 1 April 2008. This application date is incorrect and should have been from the date of assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 25 Other matters 27 PIE RULES – AUCKLAND REGIONAL HOLDINGS Submission (Matter raised by officials) The PIE rules should be amended to allow Auckland Regional Holdings (ARH) to wholly own a portfolio investment entity (PIE). Comment Officials consider that exceptions to the investor membership and investor interest size requirements in sections HL 6(1) and HL 9(4) respectively should be made to allow ARH to be the sole investor in a PIE and make an investment of any size into a PIE without jeopardising the PIE’s status. This would have the effect of allowing ARH to wholly own a PIE. The PIE rules allow other PIEs and collective investment vehicles to wholly own PIEs. Also, there are specific provisions that allow the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, the Earthquake Commission and the Accident Compensation Commission to wholly own a PIE. These specific exceptions were included because these entities are in-substance widely held, as their ultimate beneficiaries are the public. Auckland Regional Holdings is analogous as it was established by statute as an investment manager for the main purpose of providing funding for regional transport and stormwater programmes for the benefit of the Auckland public. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 28 RETIREMENT SCHEME CONTRIBUTION WITHHOLDING TAX (RSCWT) Issue: Definition of “retirement scheme contribution” too wide Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “retirement scheme contribution” should be amended so that it applies only to amounts that are assessable income. Comment The RSCWT is a final withholding tax to be imposed instead of income tax on retirement scheme contributions made by a retirement scheme to a retirement savings scheme. The definition of “retirement scheme contribution” as drafted includes both taxable and non-taxable amounts. The policy intention is not to impose RSCWT on amounts that would not have been taxable if the amount had of been received by the person rather than the retirement savings scheme. For example, a Māori authority can distribute to its members amounts that it earned in a company before becoming a Māori authority as a non-taxable Māori authority distribution. This is because tax has already been paid when that income was earned by the company. It is recommended that the definition of “retirement scheme contribution” be amended so that it applies only to amounts that are assessable income. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 29 Issue: That taxable Māori authority distributions that are retirement scheme contributions be excluded from the resident withholding tax rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) The resident withholding tax rules should be amended to exclude taxable Māori authority distributions that are subject to the RSCWT so that these distributions are not subject to resident withholding tax as well as RSCWT. Comment At present, a taxable Māori authority distribution which is subject to the RSCWT is also subject to resident withholding tax if the distribution does not have sufficient Māori authority credits attached. Such distributions should be subject only to RSCWT. It is recommended that the resident withholding tax rules be amended to exclude taxable Māori authority distributions that are subject to RSCWT. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.
Income Tax Bill Officials’ Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill 30 April 2007 Prepared by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department CONTENTS Overview 1 Significant policy issues 2 Submissions recommended to be accepted 9 Submissions recommended to be declined 37 Table of officials’ recommended changes 59 1 OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS The Income Tax Bill rewrites Parts F to Z and the Schedules of the Income Tax Act 2004 and re-enacts the remainder of the Act. It represents the final stage of the progressive rewrite of the Act, which began in the early 1990s. The first stage, completed in 1994, was the reorganisation of the Act to make its structure logical and coherent. The second stage was the rewrite of the Act’s core provisions in 1996. The third stage was the rewrite of Parts C to E in 2004. Most submissions on the bill came from professional associations. Five submissions were received, some of them very substantive. Submissions raised points on a range of issues: transitional, structural, policy, technical and drafting. Of these, drafting issues and assurance that no change in outcome would arise were the most frequently raised. Additional consultation occurred with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and the New Zealand Law Society. A major concern arising from further consultation was that any changes in the words used in the rewritten legislation create a risk that unintended changes in existing law may occur in the bill. This risk arises because the courts generally interpret Parliament’s intention on a particular issue through the words expressed in the legislation. The main feature of this additional consultation was that the unintended change process should continue to be managed by an independent committee (currently the Rewrite Advisory Panel). If this process continues, the committee will consider whether issues brought to its attention from the rewritten legislation constituted unintended changes in law. If the committee concludes that such changes have occurred, it will recommend remedial legislation. This process arose from an unequivocal statement of intent from the government before enactment of the 2004 Act that, when unintended changes in law are identified, retrospective legislation reinstating the meaning and effect of the law as set out in the Income Tax Act 1994 will be introduced. The main policy matters raised in submissions relate to the term “permanent home” in the rewritten definition of “residence” and the policy intention of clause FA 3. In addition, some submissions and officials’ own quality control work have noted the need to identify some provisions as intended changes. Each of these policy matters is dealt with in the first section of the report. This is followed by a series of tables setting out officials’ recommendations on submissions on the bill, including submissions from officials arising from their own quality control and updating work. 2 SIGNIFICANT POLICY ISSUES Issue: Definition of residence Clause YD 1(1), (2) Submissions (2 – KPMG) (3 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) That “a permanent home” is not the same as a “permanent place of abode”; therefore the change in wording changes the existing law. That a change in the law is not in accordance with the objectives of the rewrite to rewrite the Income Tax Act 2004; alternatively, the change has not been identified as an intended policy change that has been considered through the Generic Tax Policy Process. That the Income Tax Bill should provide more guidance on how the test is to be applied. Comment One of the tests of tax residence for individuals is whether a person has a “permanent place of abode” in New Zealand. This term is undefined in the Income Tax Act 2004, and was introduced in 1980 in response to a court decision, apparently to copy a phrase used in the Australian income tax legislation. At that time, the policy files indicate that Inland Revenue considered that “permanent place of abode” was in essence a synonym for “permanent home”. Since that time, Inland Revenue has published significant commentary that seeks to explain how “permanent place of abode” is to be interpreted in practice, involving consideration of a range of factors and not merely the existence of permanent accommodation and that commentary is widely cited and relied upon. The Income Tax Bill adopted the wording of “permanent home” to replace “permanent place of abode”, being a more modern expression of the term having the same meaning as a matter of semantics. Officials also felt that “permanent home” was more likely to indicate to readers that the test did not refer merely to accommodation. The leading case in New Zealand on applying the residence test – Geothermal Energy NZ Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue in 1979 – interpreted the meaning of the term “home” (then used in the legislation). The judge gave an extensive summary of how the term should be applied, that involves an approach broadly similar to that in the Inland Revenue commentary on the meaning of “permanent place of abode”, which judicial summary is also commonly still cited as relevant. However two submissions on the bill (KPMG and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) considered that changing the wording in this way would lead to the law no longer including various nuances concerning how the term “permanent place of abode” is applied in practice, that relate to a person’s centre of economic interests. 3 After consideration of the submissions and points made in subsequent consultation, officials agreed that it would be desirable to reinstate the term “permanent place of abode” and defer, for a process allowing wider consultation, any updating of the language and possible insertion of further guidance on its meaning. The Institute noted that it would be helpful to refer for policy consideration the question of whether the residence rule should explicitly refer to a person’s centre of economic interest. Officials agree with the Institute’s suggestion. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Disposal of shares on revenue account under a dividend stripping arrangement Clause FA 3 Submission (5 – New Zealand Law Society) That clause FA 3 results in an unintended law change as a result of the deletion of the proviso from the current section FC 3 and that the proviso should be reinserted into the clause. Comment Clause FA 3 rewrites section FC 3 of the 2004 Act, with the proviso rewritten in subclause (2), and is listed in Schedule 51 as being an intended change. The policy of the section is directed at a person who acquires shares on revenue account and who, by virtue of their shareholding, strips a dividend from the shares and disposes of the shares in a way that creates a loss for income tax purposes that offsets the taxable income from the dividend or offsets other taxable income. Background This rule was introduced in 1959. The policy concern arose in the early 1950s. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue reported, on 25 March 1958, to the Minster in charge of the Department as follows: Share Dealers Purchasing Shares “Cum Div” and selling “Ex Div” and claiming resulting loss for tax purposes In New Zealand dividends are treated as non-assessable income. A taxpayer who deals in shares is assessable on any profits and likewise may claim any loss as a deduction against assessable income derived from other sources. In one instance, the taxpayer – ostensibly a share dealer – purchased shares in a company with large accumulated profits. This taxpayer then arranged for the company to declare a large dividend. This had the effect of substantially reducing the value of the shares which were then sold. The taxpayer claimed the resulting loss when in point of fact it was balanced by the non-assessable dividends. 4 Speech notes prepared for the Minister to introduce the bill in 1959 state: The object of the amendment is to disallow part or all of any loss on the deal in cases where it is brought about by what is commonly known as “dividend stripping”. ... The clause is aimed at preventing manipulations to distribute the profits of a company in such a way that dividend tax is avoided. Representations have been made that in certain circumstances, the clause may result in part of the dividend being taxed as both a dividend and as a profit on the share sale. That is not the intention and I am having the drafting looked at again to ensure that there will be no double taxing. The Department’s technical policy circular prepared in 1959 following enactment of the legislation notes that: The object of the amendment is to disallow part or all of any loss on the deal in cases where it is brought about by what is commonly known as dividend stripping. ... The position generally is that the dividend received is taken into account as income and no loss is allowed on the share deal. The effect of the proviso is to avoid double taxation where an overall profit arises from the deal. ... The proviso is designed to avoid double taxation. Until the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996, the proviso worked by comparing the tax on the dividend to the tax on the overall “profit” on the share trade and, if the tax on the dividends was greater than the tax on the “profit”, there was no further tax to pay. The 1996 rewording, necessary because of the rewriting of the Act’s core provisions, meant the term “profit” could not be used, was intended to achieve the same result. To summarise, the policy of this provision is: • A loss on sale incurred by a person holding shares on revenue account will not be effective for tax purposes if that loss arises from dividend stripping arrangements (as defined in section FC 3). • Denying the loss for tax purposes prevents that loss being offset against the dividend or (if the dividend is exempt) against other income. • The dividend under the dividend stripping arrangement will be subject to the normal tax rules applying to dividends. • Since 21 May 1999, the rule applies to all shares held on revenue account and so is no longer restricted just to persons dealing in shares. The wording of section FC 3 of the 2004 Act Officials agree that the 1996 wording in the proviso in section FC 3 of the 2004 Act (and 1994 Act) needed to be improved. This difficulty in easily ascertaining the meaning of the section was specifically noted in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11 No 3, issued in October 1999: As pointed out by submissions, further work on section FC 3 seems appropriate to simplify and clarify its wording. 5 The wording of clause FA 3 of the Income Tax Bill This lack of clarity in the wording in section FC 3 is addressed in rewriting the provision in the Income Tax Bill as clause FA 3, with the rewritten proviso in subclause (2). As part of preparing that drafting, the draft provision was included in the Exposure Draft on Part F, issued in November 2005. Two submissions were received on clause FA 3. One submission was from the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants which stated that “the simplification approach and the removal of the proviso are acceptable”. The second submission was from a legal firm that made essentially the same argument now being put forward by the Law Society. Officials carefully considered the submission from the legal firm and concluded that the analysis contained an interpretation of section FC 3 that would defeat the policy intention of the rule. It would mean that, in a case where dividends are taxable, the loss on the share sale offsets the taxable dividend. It would mean that the rule only operated in the case of exempt dividends. The legislative history makes it clear beyond doubt that the rule was never intended only to apply to exempt dividends. Therefore, officials declined that submission. Overview of how clause FA 3 meets the policy intent Clause FA 3 is drafted to clearly express the policy of denying an artificial loss arising from a dividend stripping arrangement that offsets either a taxable dividend or tax on other income. This is best illustrated using the example given by the Law Society on pages 2–3 of its submission. In the absence of section FC 3 (clause FA 3 of the bill), the shareholder would have a loss on sale of $20 which they could offset against the dividend in calculating their taxable income for the income year. Of the $200 dividend, only $180 would be taxable. The policy of the rule is to deny that loss and ensure the dividend is fully taxed. Clause FA 3 operates by creating a deemed amount of income no less than the stripped dividend but no greater than the artificial loss arising because of the dividend stripping arrangement. In the example, the amount of income created under this rule is equal to the artificial loss ($20) so that the loss cannot reduce tax on the dividend. By adopting this drafting approach, no profit on sale can arise under the provision. This means that the dividend is treated as an additional amount on the sale only to the extent of the loss and not to the extent that a profit would result in taxation on both the dividend and the profit (in other words, double taxation). This means that the effect of the proviso to section FC 3(1) of the 2004 Act is achieved in a clearer way. 6 Intended change Officials consider this same result would arise under current section FC 3, having regard to its clear legislative history. Officials consider the interpretation of the provision offered by the Law Society defeats the policy intention of the rule, reducing it to a provision only operating in the case of exempt dividends. This is contrary to the clear intention that it also applies to taxable dividends. Officials do not consider this outcome is double taxation, as the rule only denies an artificial loss that would otherwise be used to offset tax on the dividend or against other income and does not result in an artificial profit on sale that would be also taxed. Officials do not agree that this drafting change in FA 3 represents an unintended change as clause FA 3 is listed in Schedule 21, being a provision with an intended change. The omission of the proviso is intended. The Rewrite Advisory Panel reviewed and agreed to the drafting for this clause and its listing as an intended change in the bill. Further consultation Subsequent consultation with the Society occurred, detailing the history of the rule, which resulted in the Society acknowledging that officials’ view of the policy intention and application of the rule was correct. However, the Society also noted that the more general anti-dividend streaming rule, now in clause GB 1, overlapped the rule in clause FA 3, and that a policy review of clause FA 3 should occur as a matter of priority. Officials agree this policy review should occur. The Society also suggested some minor rewording of clause FA 3(2) to make the policy intent even clearer, to which officials have agreed. Recommendation That the submission be declined but that the relationship of the rule to the structure of the Act and in particular to the anti-avoidance rule relating to dividend stripping is considered for inclusion as a priority matter on the policy work programme. Issue: Intended changes in law Clause: Schedule 51 Submission (5 – New Zealand Law Society) That clause LC 9(2) should be noted as an intended change. (Officials) That clause LC 9(2) and the definitions of land, mortgage and pay in clause YA 1 be listed in Schedule 51 as an intended change. 7 Comment Officials have continued their quality control review of the clauses in the bill, and now list below a number of definitions and clauses that they consider should be included in schedule 51 as intended changes in law. The Rewrite Advisory Panel considers it is appropriate for these provisions to be noted as intended changes in law: Clause in the bill The change in law LC 9(2) apportionment for tax credit for an absentee: housekeeper and low income This rule relates to the housekeeper and low income tax credits (formerly termed rebates). The policy of the rule is to apportion income of an absentee between periods of the person’s absence and presence in New Zealand. The apportionment set out in the bill is on a daily basis. In the interest of simplification, the bill omits from the 2004 Act corresponding rule the formula that apportioned the income on a “weeks” basis for persons with “regular pay periods”. A change in effect is anticipated, but the omission should result at most in a small difference in outcome in favour of taxpayers. The New Zealand Law Society indicated in their submission on the bill that it would be preferable to list this as an intended change. YA 1 definition of “land” The provision is simplified and structured so that the first three paragraphs of the rewritten definition are to apply generally for the Act. This is consistent with the objectives of plain accessible legislation and is thought highly unlikely to result in any material change in law. However, as this change in drafting could conceivably result in a change in outcome in some circumstances, the change should be identified for readers. YA 1 definition of “mortgage” The definition of “mortgage” was introduced at a time when mortgages were subject to tax as a subset of land tax. The drafting in the bill provides for the term to apply generally for the Act. This is consistent with the objectives of plain, accessible and up-to-date legislation and is thought highly unlikely to result in any material change in law. However, as this change in drafting could conceivably result in a change in outcome in some circumstances, the change should be identified for readers. YA 1 definition of “pay” The provision is simplified and structured to apply generally for the Act. This is consistent with the objectives of plain accessible legislation and is thought highly unlikely to result in any material change in law. However, as this change in drafting could conceivably result in a change in outcome in some circumstances, the change should be identified for readers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 8 9 TABLE OF OFFICIALS’ RECOMMENDATIONS ON SUBMISSIONS ON BILL – RECOMMENDED TO BE ACCEPTED The following table lists technical and drafting issues raised in submissions that officials recommend be accepted. 10 11 Parts C to E – Reco mmend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That in clause CD 50(8), the words “including interest and discount on issue” should be removed from brackets. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That, clause CT 6(1), th e words “petroleum mining permit” should be replaced by “petroleum permit”. Officials agree with the subm ission. The policy intent of section CT 6 is that it applies to all types of petroleum permits, not just a mining permit. However the policy and scope of the rule in the 2004 Act extended to permits in relation to petroleum as well as existing privileges (as defined in the Crown Minerals Act section 106) for mining and exploration licences under Part 1 of the 1937 Act. That the submission be accepted. That as a consequence of this submission the term “petroleum mining permit” in the bill be replaced by “petroleum permit”. That the defined term in clause YA 1 “petroleum permit” be restored and that the term “petroleum mining permit” as indicated in appendix 1 be retained but consideration given to whether it needs to be a defined term or whether the direct reference to the Crown Minerals Act can be made within the relevant section (DT 6(c)). New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the words “the vines or trees” should be replaced by the words “the non-listed horticultural plants” in paragraph (b) and (c) of clause DO 4(6). Officials agree that the concep t of non-listed horticultural plants provides scope for the CIR to list types of plants that are other than vines and trees. This was a policy extension introduced in the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004. The TIB item on the Act noted “It retains the same treatment that was previously provided for vines and trees and operates as a kind of default rule for horticultural plants not listed by the Commissioner.” That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants In clause DV 16, that th e words “to the extent to which the expenditure or losses arises” should be replaced by the words “except to the extent to which the expenditure or loss arises”. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and the New Zealand Law Society That, in clause DV 19(2), paragraph (a) should cross-refer to subsection (4) rather than subsection (3). That paragraph (b) of clause DV 19(2) should cross-refer to subsection (5) rather than subsection (4). Officials agree with th e submissions. That the submissions be accepted. 12 Parts C to E – Reco mmend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society Clause DV 19(7) has been oversimplified. Currently, statutory producer boards are exempt from section HF 1(2)(b) and this is not reproduced. If the intent is that a SPB is able to deduct the full amount of an association rebate without reference to mutual transaction entered into, then that is a change in policy. Officials consider the rule is in tended to address the timing of the deduction rather than the criteria for having the deduction. Officials agree this should be clarified to overcome the ambiguity identified. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The heading to subclause EA 3(4) “Determination of values” should be “unexpired portion: expenditure on goods”. This is an issue of drafting cons istency. No policy issue arises otherwise. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the heading to subclause EB 24(4) should refer to “Disposals of timber” rather than “Disposals of trading stock”. Agree that the subject matter of the subclause is to do with rights to take timber as well as standing timber (with exceptions). That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That, in clause EJ 23(3), the wording “ofdeductions” be replaced by “of deductions.” Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 13 Part F – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That the subh eading to subclause FA 8(2) is grammatically incorrect. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That the subh eadings to subclause FA 14(2) is grammatically incorrect. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the terms “carrying on” and “carrying out” should be used consistently between sections FB 4(2) and FB 4(3). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That, in clauses FB 6(2) and FB 7(2), the clarity of current section FF 7 is lost and that the transferee should be mentioned. The subject matter of these provisions is the transfer of the relationship property and the value placed on that transfer. While officials consider it is unnecessary to refer to the transferee giving consideration, officials agree that separating the acquisition and the value into two or three paragraphs in subclause (2) would improve clarity. That the submission be accepted in relation to improving the clarity. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That paragraph (b) of the definition of “close relative” in clause FC 1(2) should be removed. The policy intention of the close relative restriction is that the roll-over relief applies so long as all assets in the tax base of the deceased being transferred pass to the spouse or de facto partner or another person who is a relative within the second degree of relationship of the deceased person. The intention behind the drafting of (b) appears to be to ensure that the 2nd degree of relationship test is not applied to a spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner. However, NZICA’s submission identifies that the paragraph could have a different outcome from that intention. The wording could be restructured into the opening words. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That, in clau se FC 2, the timing of determining market value for the transfers other than on death should be clarified. Although it should not be necessary in a plain language environment, the timing is clarif ied as a matter of consistency. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That subclause FC 8(3) should be renumbered FC 8(2). Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That in clause FE 6(3), the words “the amount is calculated using the formula-” should be inserted before the formula in section FE 6. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the subheading for section FE 30(3) should be “When company A cannot be part of group”. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 14 Part F – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the formula in section FF 6(4) should use the term “tax rate” rather than “rate” to be consistent with the defined term “tax rate” in subsection FF 6(5) Officials agree that the parameters should be consistent. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That section FF 7(2)(b) sh ould be split so that each paragraph deals with a separate item. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That section FF 7(6)(b) should refer to subsection (3) rather than subsection (4). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clau se FL 1(2), the meaning of “just before” is unclear. This term is an alternative term to “immediately before,” as used in other provisions in the bill. While officials consider the meaning is clear, officials consider that the submission raises a point of drafting consistency, and agree that one phrasing should be adopted for this purpose and suggest the term “just before” be replaced by “immediately before”. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the heading to subsection FM 3(1) should be “Taxable income of consolidated group” rather than “Taxable income of group” to be consistent with the terms used in subpart FM. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That subsection FM 10(2) should state what the exceptions to the section are. A rule setting out whether an expenditure or loss is a deduction must be listed in Part D. Clause FM 10(2) refers to the rule in clause DV 16(2)(a) and (b) which refers to the exceptions. However, it could improve access to the exceptions if subclause FM 10(2) were extended along the lines “unless the exceptions in section DV 16(2)(a) or (b) apply”. That the submission be accepted, but that the drafting identify the location of the exceptions to the denial of the deduction in clause DV 16. New Zealand Law Society That in clau se FM 30, the compare note should include section NH 4(9). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause FN 5 clarifies that a resident imputation subgroup can be formed with one company. Officials agree with the submissi on, but that the clarification is better placed in clause FN 8. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause FN 9 should contain a reference to the effective date for becoming a member of an imputation group. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 15 Part F – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That subcla use FO 3(1)(c) should state that a company that derives only exempt income includes a local authority that is not a council-controlled organisation. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That, in clause FO 4, a reference to “privileges” should be reinstated as it is different from the concepts of “rights and powers”. Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That subcla use FO 15(4) is unnecessary as it repeats subclause FO 15(2). Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That subcla use FO 18(4) should clarify that it applies to the amalgamating company as the borrowing company and that it overrides subclause FO 18(2)(b). Officials agree that subclaus e FO 18(4) should override subclause FO 18(2)(b), as FO 18(1) to (3) are intended to apply only if the amalgamating company is solvent. Officials agree that this should be clarified. Subclause FO 18(4) states that the “amalgamating company that is the borrower ...”. Officials consider this is sufficiently clear that the amalgamating company is the borrowing company. That the submission be accepted in relation to clarifying that subclauses FO 18(1)-(3) apply only when the amalgamating company that is the borrower is solvent. 16 Part G – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That subclause GA 1(6) should have a reference to subsection (2) to prevent any potential misapplication of this provision. Officials consider that the linkage is sufficiently clear in a plain English drafting context, but agree that this could improve the clarity of the relationship given other subclauses contain appropriate cross-referencing. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clau se GA 2, the words “but for the arrangement” have a potentially wider meaning than the words “if the a rrangement had not been made or entered into”. This would be a law change. The words “but for the arrangement” should be replaced by “had the arrangement not occurred”. The use of “but for the arrangement” is intended to be a plainer phrasing of the corresponding phrase in the 2004 Act. While officials consider that there is no material risk of the wording being read more widely, in clause GA 2 should be worded in the same was as clause GA 1. Therefore the phrase “but for the arrangement” should be replaced by “had the arrangement not occurred” in clauses GA 2, GB 31 and GB 44 for consistency with clause GA 1. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That the refe rence in subclause GB 8(1)(c) to “a purpose or effect” does not reflect section GC 8 of the 2004 Act, which clearly requires that the arrangement has “the purpose or effect”. Officials agree that the wording “a purpose or effect” should be replaced by “the purpose or effect”. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause GB 9, the test of whether the disposal is to a NZ resident who has a 10% or more income interest should be determined immediately after disposition. Officials agree with this submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause GB 10, the test of whether the acquisition is from a NZ resident who has a 10% or more income interest should to be determined immediately before the acquisition. Officials agree with this submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That, in subclause GB 13(1)(b), the words “immediately after the disposition” should be inserted after “the disposal is not to a New Zealand resident who”. Officials agree with this submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That for clarity , in clause GB 14(1)(b), the words “immediately prior to the disposition” should be inserted after “the acquisition is not from a New Zealand resident who”. Officials agree with this submission. That the submission be accepted. 17 Part G – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That paragra phs (b) and (c) of clause GB 19(1) could potentially be narrower in scope because the requirement that the payment is contingent in (1)(c) is in addition to an agreement to defer payment in (1)(b). Officials agree that the contingent payment test should not apply to paragraph (b). That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in subc lause GB 24 (2)(g)(ii) the phrase “shares or losses” should be replaced by “shares of losses”. Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause GB 36 (2), that the words “to the extent to which this subsection applies to the arrangement” should be inserted after “Subsection (1) does not apply”. Officials agree with this submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That the words “or effect” should be deleted from clause GB 39(1)(b). Section GC 25 of the 2004 Act does not refer to an effect of the arrangement. Officials agree with this submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In GB 43, that the words “to the extent to which this subsection applies to the arrangement” should be inserted at the end of subsection (2). Officials agree with this submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That the words “u nless the land is subject to a right in favour of the seller to take timber” should be inserted at the end of cl ause GC 2 (1)(b). The omission of those words could unintentionally widen the application of clause GC 1. Officials consider that the rewording to refer only to “a disposal of standing timber” helps to clarify the application of the rule, but agree that equivalent qualifying words should be reinserted to avoid the residual possibility of a change in law. Officials consider the wording in clause GC 2(3) adequately addresses the matter raised in the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in subc lause GC 6 (3)(b): “if” should be replaced by “and”. Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. 18 Part H – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the terms “qualifying company” and “loss attributing qualifying company” be retained. Before the rewrite of the Income Tax Act 1976, the term “qualifying” was used a number of times in defined terms. An objective in the rewrite has been to refine the defined terms to give the reader a clearer se nse of the underlying policy. It has been difficult to find an appropriate wording that best provides insight into the underlying policy for both a loss attributing qualifying company and a qualifying company. The word “attributing” was chosen because of its dictionary meaning of treating something as belonging to something else. The term “attributing” in “loss attributing qualifying company” effectively means “transferring to”. Relevant aspects of the definition of the word “attribute” from the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 1 are: “To assign, give or concede to a person as a right ”; “Ascribe as belonging or appropriate to”; “Ascribe to as an inherent quality or characteristic”; “Ascribe to as an effect or consequence”. The wo rd “ascribe” is defined in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary as “assign or impute to someone or something as an action, effect, product, etc, or as a quality, characteristic or property (rarel y in a material sense”; or “reckon up, count up”. However, it is agreed that the term “attributing company” may be misleading. On balance, offi cials consider that replacing the terms “qualifying company” and “loss attributing qualifying company” with the terms “a ttributing company” and “loss attributing company” will not provide sufficient benefit to justify the change in term. Howe ver, generally, the aim of this completion of the rewrite exercise will be to avoid using labels of limited meaning, such as “qua lifying” or “speci al”, in favour of terms that give more information to a reader. The government has also signalled the possibility that the qualifying company rules are to be reviewed. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That clause HA 1(1)(a) be reworded and that the word “treated” should be removed from section HA 1(1)(b). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 1 Oxford University Press, 5 th Ed., 2002. 19 Part H – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That the referen ce in clause HA 6(1)(b) to a “flat- owning company” should be included in the definition of “flat-owning company” in clause YA 1. Officials consider that the term “flat-owning company,” is at present an undefined term. However, the policy is that for the purposes of entry to the qualifying company rules, this type of company must be a “body corporate” through which shareholders obtain use of residential property. Therefore, it would be appropriate to have the definition in clause YA 1 that relates to clau se CD 31 also apply to clause HA 6. Officials consider that this is consistent with the criteria set out in section OB 3(1)(b)( ii) (Definition of qualifying company). That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause HA 7(3) should include civil unions and de facto relationships. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause HA 8(5) should only apply to situations where a group of shareholders assume the income tax liability for the minority shareholders in an attributing company, as described in subsection (3). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That clause HA 10 should use the term “shareholder decision-making rights”, as defined in clause YA 1. Officials agree that the define d term “shareholder decision making-rights” seems to duplicate the outcome under clause HA 10. This would be a sensible rationalisation. That the submission be accepted New Zealand Law Society In clause HC 1, that the compare note should include section GC 14 and that clause HH 7 should be omitted from the compare note. Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause HC 6, that the compare note should omit section OF 2(2). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clause HC 15(5)(a)(ii), the reference to 1988 version provisions should be omitted. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted, but that the words ”, or the 1988 version provisions” be added at the end of the subparagraph. New Zealand Law Society That in clause HC 36, the references to sections OC 9 to OC 11 of the 2004 Act should be amended to refer to clauses YB 9 to YB 11. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That the agency provisions in the bill in subpart HD create uncertainty about which income the agency obligation relates – in particular, clauses HD 10, HD 19, HD 20) and HD 27. Officials agree that the drafting could clarify the nature of the obligations. That the submission be accepted. 20 Part H – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That the formula in clause HD 7(1) results in an amount of tax payable rather than a rate of tax. Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That the parameters of the formula in clause HD 7(1) are confusing and should be clarified. Officials agree that this rule can be simplified further. The calculation effectively results in the effective tax rate on the taxable income of the principal is then used to calculate the tax payable on the taxable income under the agency. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause HD 7(2)(B) should reflect that a rate scale may apply and a single rate will not produce the correct outcome. Officials agree that the formula is intended to calculate the effective tax rate that takes into account marginal tax rates. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause HD 7(2)(c) should define proportion of agency taxable income as the proportion of a principal’s taxable income that relates to the agency. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause HD 15 (3)(a) should state that a director record their dissent with both the company and the CIR. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause HD 19 omits a reference to “principal”, and this may extend the scope of the rule. Officials agree with this submission for reasons of consistency. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clause HD 20, the change in drafting in relation to apportionment may give rise to an unintended change in outcome from that under section HK 17 of the 2004 Act. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clause HD 26, the reference to “gross income” should be replaced by a reference to “income”. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clause HE 2, the provision uses an undefined term “trading transaction” and that subclause (2) requires a transaction to be both a trading transaction and one or more of the transactions referred to in (a) to (c). Officials agree with the submi ssion. Officials agree that the phrase “is a trading transaction” is unnecessary and can be omitted and the word “is” on line 2 of the clause HE 2(2) should be replaced by the word “includes”. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause HF 11 (3) refers to “time notice is given” but does not specify which notice. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 21 Part H – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That clause HR 2(3) treats Category A Income derived by a GIF as income of a notional company and that this is a more realistic reflection. Officials agree with the submission (assuming that the “notional company” treatment is the “mor e realistic” treatment) and note that the definition of “company” also recognises this notional company treatment in paragraph (c) of that definition. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clause HR 5(6), the placement of the word “not” after “mutual association” should be reconsidered. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted 22 Part L – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That the compare note for clause LB 3 should include section NF 8B(b). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause LC 9 omits one of the tests in current section KF 3: the number of weeks test. It should be noted as an intended change. Officials agree that the calculation methods have been rationalised to a single basis and also agree that this change is intended. This is a rationalisation that should be noted in Schedule 51. That the submission be accepted, and that the change is noted as an intended change in Schedule 51. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That clause LC 9 is narrower than section KF 3 of the 2004 Act. Section KF 3 of the 2004 Act applies when a person: 1. is not resident in New Zealand for part of a tax year (an absentee); and 2. is entitled to any or a combination of the child rebate, the transitional tax allowance or the housekeeper rebate (sections KC 1 to KC 4 of the 2004 Act). Section KF 3 apportions these rebates based on the period the person derives remuneration for personal services that is assessable income. For an absentee who had regular pay cycles the apportionment was based on \[complete\] weeks, and in all other situations the apportionment was performed on a daily basis. There appears to be no policy reason why a single calculation should not produce a correct apportionment of the relevant rebate. Consequently the apportionment calculation was rationalised to a single daily basis, which would provide a small benefit for absentees with regular pay cycles. However, the words “for regular pay periods” should be omitted from clause LC 9(3)(b). We do not agree with the Institute’s comments that section KC 1(3) of the 2004 Act would apply to an absentee. The policy is that an absentee is not permitted this rebate. Also, the policy of section KC 3 is that it does not apply to a person who is a non-resident of New Zealand throughout the year. It was unnecessary to consider these distinctions in policy in rewriting these provisions. That the submission be declined but that the correction be made to clause LC 9(3)(b). New Zealand Law Society That in clause LC 11(2), reference to subsection (5) should be to subsection (4). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 23 Part L – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That in clause LC 11(2)(c) there would be better clarity if the word “reducing” were replaced by “calculating”. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LD 1( 2), “33%” should be replaced by “33 and one third %”. Officials agree with the submi ssion. However, the wording of the provision requires some reco nsideration to reflect more clearly that the policy extends beyond a charitable purpose. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LE 5(2) , the formula does not replicate the existing formula: item (c) total beneficiary credits should be increased by supplementary dividends paid to beneficiaries. In addition, the layout could be better to show subtraction of person’s supplementary dividend was separate from the rest of the formula. Officials agree that item (c) should include the amount of supplementary dividends paid to the beneficiaries. However, the layout is subject to printing constraints. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LE 6, the formula does not replicate the existing formula: item (c) total beneficiary credits should be increased by supplementary dividends paid to beneficiaries. Officials agree with the submission. That the su bmission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LF 1, the cross-reference in subsection (5) should be to section LF 8 rather than section LF 7. Officials agree with the submission. That the su bmission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LF 3, the formula does not replicate the existing formula: item (c) total beneficiary credits should be increased by supplementary dividends paid to beneficiaries. Officials agree that item (c) should include the amount of supplementary dividends paid to the beneficiaries. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LF 4 the formula does not replicate the existing formula: item (c) total beneficiary credits should be increased by supplementary dividends paid to beneficiaries. Officials agree that item (c) should include the amount of supplementary dividends paid to the beneficiaries. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause LF 8(3)(a) should end in “and/or”, and not end in “or”. Officials agree that the policy is that the two limitations are not alternatives in the corresponding provision (section LD 9(2) of the 2004 Act). That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause LJ 1(5) does not make sense. Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be acc epted. New Zealand Law Society That the referen ce in clause LK 1(3) should be to subpart LQ (Tax credits for CTR companies). Officials agree with the submission. That the su bmission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clause LK 5, in the compare note: add section LC 4(6). Officials agree with the submission. That the su bmission be accepted. 24 Part L – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That in clause LL 3, the formula in subsection (1) does not replicate existing formula. The “1” should be outside the division. Officials agree with the submi ssion. The formula calculating the amount of the “grey list dividend” should be corrected. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LL 6, the formula in subsection (3) does not replicate existing formula. ((relevant standard dividend + q + q) x company tax rate) – tax withheld. Officials agree with the submission. The bracket before “company rate” should be omitted and a “)” bracket inserted after “company rate”. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LO 2, the formula does not replicate the existing formula: item (c) total beneficiary credits should be increased by supplementary dividends paid to beneficiaries. Officials agree that item (c) should include the amount of supplementary dividends paid to the beneficiaries. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LP 6( 1)(b) the words “unless the provision expressly refers to this subsection” should be added. Officials agree with the submissi on. The effect of the words in brackets from subsection LE 2(11)(b) of the 2004 Act should be included in the rewritten provision. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LQ 5( 5)(b) the words “unless the provision expressly refers to this subsection” should be added. Officials agree that the eff ect of the words following “constitution” in section LG 1(4)(b ) of the 2004 Act should be included in the rewritten provision in subparts LP and LQ. That the submission be accepted. 25 Part M – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That clause MB 4(4) repeats the formula expressed in subsection (2). If the subsections are to perform separate functions, this should be made clearer. Officials agree that the two subsections should identify their relationship. However an amendment to the corresponding provision in the 2004 Act by section 103(2) of the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 needs to be incorporated. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society Clause MB 5 (3) should exclude amounts attributable to a contribution by the person as a member of the scheme, rather than simply an amount of a contribution. The word s “attributable to” are necessary. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause MB 5, it should also be made clear that the inclusion of distributions from super schemes in assessable income is for the purpose of calculating family scheme income only. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. Child Poverty Action Group That clause MD 9(4)(a) should be omitted or alternatively the relationship with clause MD 9(4)(d) be clarified. Clause MD 9(4) contains th e provisions from section KD 2AAA(8) of the 2004 Act as they were at the time of introduction of the bill. However section 105 (1)(c) of the Taxation (Savings investment and Miscellaneous Provisions Act) 2006, which was assented to after the bill was introduced, amends this rule. The amendment clarifies that recipients of ea rnings-related compensation for incapacity arising from an accident under the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001 may be eligible for the in-work payment. Officials agree with the comment that paragraph (d) could be clarified by indicating more clearly that it is referring to the full-time earner tests in subclause MD 9(1)(a). That the submission be accepted. 26 Part O – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society In clause OA 8(7), the paragraphs should be linked by “and” not “or”. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society Clause OA 9( 2) reflects the general rule that credit/debit transferred, but does not reflect the specific rule for assessing continuity for transferred credits for all times before amalgamation (tested by reference to interests formerly held in an amalgamating company). See current section ME 29(1)(a). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society Clause OA 14(4) reflects the general rule that credit/debit transferred, but does not reflect the specific rule for assessing continuity for transferred credits for all times before amalgamation (tested by reference to interests formerly held in an amalgamating company). See current section ME 29(1)(a). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society Clause OB 1( 2)(a)(ii) should exclude a company acting only in capacity of trustee from being required to maintain ICA, and GIFs that derive only category B income. Officials agree that sub-paragr aph (ii) should contain an exclusion for a company acting in a trustee capacity, other than a company that is a GIF. There appears to be an inadvertent omission of the phrase “not bei ng a company that is a trustee” which should have appeared before “of a group investment fund to which paragraph (c) of the definition of company ...”. That the submission be accepted but that the provision not refer to category B income. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 1 (3) should be amended to allow Australian-resident companies excluded under subsection (2)(a)(i) and (v) to maintain an ICA. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 2(3)(b) should apply only for purposes of section OB 60. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 2(3) omits reference to the CIR’s discretion to allow the notice to take effect from the beginning of the tax year for the purpose of section OB 60. Officials agree with the submissi on. Officials consider that the drafting should be aligned with that set out in section OB 3(8)(c), and this would ensure that the Commissioner’s discretion can be exercised. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 2(7) should provid e that a company ends its status as an Australian ICA if it is ineligible to maintain an ICA. Subsection (8) currently makes no sense (for the purposes of subsection (7)). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 27 Part O – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 19 (4) is incorrect: th e credit arises on 31 March of the income year in which the expenditure is deducted. It should also be made consistent with the debit date in clause OB 46(4). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 27(1) needs amending: an Australian ICA company is intended to be allowed a credit for all NZ taxes paid by the company, including where the tax is withheld by others (as is usually the case with NRWT). Officials agree that the phrase “amount withheld by the company” should refer to the payer of the non-resident passive income. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 38(1) should only apply to companies at a time when they are not FDPA companies (see current section ME 5(1)(m)). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 39 (5) should ensure that for method 2 to apply the company must be an FDPA company for the whole of the tax year (see current section ME 5(7)). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 46 (4) is incorrect: th e credit arises on 31 March of the income year in which the expenditure is deducted. It should also be made consistent with debit date in clause OB 19(4). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 61(6) should provide that subsections (4) and (5) do not apply if an ICA company files a ratio change declaration. Under current section ME 8(3) it is clear that no breach occurs, not that the consequences of a breach are prevented. Officials agree that the words “t he consequences of” a breach are inappropriate and should be replaced by an override of subsection (5). That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 66(2) provides that an ICA company must pay further income tax on the day it stops being an ICA company. It should be “by the day”. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 67(1)(b) should refer to credits arising in the account in the following tax year, rather than to a single credit. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 28 Part O – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That clause OC 4(3)(b) provides that a company may only end its existence as an FDPA company if it “pays further FDP under sections OC 30 or 31”, but the company may have not FDP to pay under these sections: it should refer to “any further FDP payable under sections OC 30 or OC 31”. Officials agree that a clarifi cation would improve the linkage and readability, but the standard drafting style is “if any”. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OC 28 should provide that subsections (4) and (5) do not apply if an ICA company files a ration change declaration. Under current section ME 8(3) it is clear that no breach occurs, not that the consequences of a breach are prevented. Officials agree that the words “t he consequences of” a breach are inappropriate and should be replaced by an override of subsection (5). That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OC 31 provides that an ICA company must pay further income tax on the day it stops being an ICA company. It should be “by the day”. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OD 4(3)(b) provides that a company may only end its existence as an FDPA company if it “pays further FDP under sections OC 30 or 31”, but the company may have not FDP to pay under these sections: it should refer to “any further FDP payable under sections OC 30 or OC 31”. Officials agree that a clarifi cation would improve the linkage and readability, but the standard drafting style is “if any”. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OD 15 should refer to a CTR company that is part of a wholly-owned group rather than a consolidated group (see cu rrent MI 5(1)(f)(iii) and OE 7(3)(c)). Officials agree with the submission but note that the same question arises in clause OD 14. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OD 18 should make explicit that clauses GB 35 and GB 36 apply to CTR credits as if they were an FDP credit. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OD 21 should provide that subsections (4) and (5) do not apply if an ICA company files a ratio change declaration. Under current section ME 8(3) it is clear that no breach occurs, not that the consequences of a breach are prevented. Officials agree that the words “t he consequences of” a breach are inappropriate and should be replaced by an override of subsection (5). That the submission be accepted. 29 Part O – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That clause OE 4 should provide that a company/person that beco mes a non-resident of New Zealand stops being a BETA company. Officials agree with the submi ssion. Officials consider that providing for the consequence of the loss of eligibility to maintain a memorandum account should ideally be consistent across all memorandum accounts, and will do further work on the feasibility of a generic rule. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society Clause OE 7 (6) is confusing as the two references to income tax liability are to two different concepts. The first is to the company’s income tax liability for attributed CFC income ( calculated under subsection (8)), the second is to the company’s overall income tax liability calculated under core provisions. This should be clarified. Officials agree that the attributed CFC liability should be calculated on the basis it was the only income derived by the company. A standard drafting approach exists for this situation. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society Clause OE 11 provides a credit date for when a BETA company with debit balance ceases to a BETA company. But in current section MF 4(2)(e) it is when the company ceases to be resident in New Zealand. If it is clear in clauses OE 4 and OE 18 that the date a company stops being a BETA company is the same date that it becomes not resident in NZ, that would be acceptable. Officials agree that the matter needs clarification. Officials consider that providing for th e consequence of the loss of eligibility to maintain a memorandum account should ideally be consistent across all memorandum accounts, and w ill do further work on the feasibility of a generic rule. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society Clause OE 12(1)( c) refers to BETA debits for an amount of a payment of FDP that “may have been paid to reduce a tax loss”. The words should be “may have been paid by an election to reduce a tax loss”. The same problem is in clause OP 105. It may not be correct to refer to FDP being “paid” as no payment is ever made. What date is “day of payment”? However the same problem exists in current section MF 4(4)(a). Clauses OE 12(3) and OP 105(3) should be consistent. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 30 Part O – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That clause OE 18 should provide that a company/person that beco mes a non-resident of New Zealand stops being a BETA company. Officials agree with the submi ssion. Officials consider that providing for the consequence of the loss of eligibility to maintain a memorandum account should ideally be consistent across all memorandum accounts, and will do further work on the feasibility of a generic rule. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society The clause OF 6 definition of “credit balance” in the formula in subsection (5) should take account of the fact that transfers of pa rt of a credit balance are permitted under this section. Officials agree that the amount of “credit balance” used in the formula in section OF 6(4) is at the discretion of the taxpayer, but may not exceed the credit balance. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause OJ 16, subclause (5) should reflect the same debit date provided for in current section ME 23(5)(a). Officials agree that the date of the debit should the date of the election referred to in subclauses (1) to (3) That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OK 20 should provide that subsections (4) and (5) do not apply if an ICA company files a ratio change declaration. Under current section ME 8(3) it is clear that no breach occurs, not that the consequences of a breach are prevented. Officials agree that the words “t he consequences of” a breach are inappropriate and should be replaced by an override of subsection (5). That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clause OP 22(1)(c), the words “before or after” should be replaced by “before or on the same date” (see current ME 13(3)). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OP 52(3) provides that a company may only end its existence as an FDPA company if it “pays further FDP under sections OC 30 or 31”, but the company may not have FDP to pay under these sections: it should refer to “any further FDP payable under sections OC 30 or OC 31”. Officials agree that a clarifi cation would improve the linkage and readability, but the standard drafting style is “if any”. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clause OP 59, the words “before or after” should be replaced by “before or on the same date” (see current section ME 13(3)). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OP 93 should make explicit that clauses GB 35 and GB 36 apply to CTR credits as if they were an FDP credit. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 31 Part O – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society Clause OP 105( 3) refers to BETA debits for an amount of a payment of FDP that “may have been paid to reduce a tax loss”. The words should be “may have been paid by an election to reduce a tax loss”. It may not be correct to refer to FDP being “paid” as no payment is ever made. What date is “day of payment”? However, the same problem exists in current section MF 4(4)(a). Clauses OE 12(3) and OP 105(3) should be consistent. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clause OP 112, the words “before or after” should be replaced by “before or on the same date” (see current section ME 13(3)). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 32 Part R – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That in clause RC 7(6) there is a drafting error in line 1 where “they” should be “the”. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the reference to clau se RC 11(3) under use of GST ratio for two-month payers should refer just to clause RC 11. Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That clause RD 50(4) should refer to “setting out the tax year in which the threshold is to start to apply” rather than “the tax year in which the threshold is to apply”. Clause RD 50(4) authorises an Order in Council to set thresholds for the purpose of section RD 48. The policy intention is that the regulation should state the first year in which the threshold is to apply. That the submission be accepted and the drafting clarified. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That clause RG 6(7) should refer to section 139B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 instead of section 150 of the Tax Administration Act. Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That clause RM 21(6) should refer to subsection (2)(c) rather than subsection (3)(c). Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That in Table R1, the reference to clause RC 11(3) under use of GST ratio for two month payers should refer just to clause RC 11. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 33 Part Y – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants Clause YA 1 “designated source investments”: That the reference should be “sec tion HR 3(7)” rather than “section HR 3(8)”. An opening bracket is required before the word definitions. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants Clause YA 1 “employer’s premises”: That the defined term “employer’s premises” refers to a definition in subclause CX 23(2) and that term should be used in that subclause instead of the phrase “premises of a person”. Officials agree that there is a disconnection to be corrected. However, officials believe that the correction should be to replace “employer’s premises”, as the defined term, with “premises”. That the submission be accepted but the correction made to replace the defined term with “premises”. Antony Lipscombe New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That there is an inconsistency between section YB 14 and Table Y1 whereby sectio n YB 14(2) states that it applies to the 1988 and 1990 version provisions and Table Y1 provides that YB 14(2) applies to the 1973 and 1988 version provisions. Officials agree with the submission. That the su bmission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the headings for subclauses YB 13(1) and (4) should be clarified. That the headings for subclauses YB 13(1) and (4) should be clarified. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That clause YB 15(5) s hould refer to the term “associated person” rather than “associated” to be consistent with the heading to the subclause and the rest of the clause. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. KPMG New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants Clause YD 1(2) permanen t home (1): A permanent home is not the same as a permanent place of abode; therefore the change in wo rding changes the existing law. Officials consider that that no change is intended and that the change in wording from “abode” to “home” substitutes an older term that effectively meant “home”. However, it is also agreed that the use of “permanent home” could lead to an argument that the nuanced meaning accorded to “permanent place of abode” is no t carried over into the rewritten Act. Officials also acknowledge that the meaning of “permanent place of abode” is difficult to a pply and uncertainty exists about its application. Officials also agree that determining the extent to which the nuanced meaning can be drafted into the rewritten Act is a policy issue beyond the scope of the rewrite project. That the submission be accepted but that the relationship of the concept of permanent home to a person’s centre of economic interest be referred to Policy Advice Division for consideration of inclusion in to the tax policy work programme. 34 Part Y – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants In clause YD 4(16), that the reference to “section YD 7” which deals with the apportionment of film rental income is incorrect. The reference to “section YD 7” should be replaced by a reference to “section YD 8(2)”. That the submission be accepted. 35 Schedules – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Accountants In Schedule 50, in section 32L(4) of the TAA, the reference to “subsection (3)” should be replaced by a reference to “subsection (2)”. Officials agree with this submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Accountants In Schedule 51, that th e typographical error in relation to clauses LA 1 to LA 10 be corrected. Officials agree with this submission. That the submission be accepted. 36 37 REVISED TABLE OF OFFICIALS’ RECOMMENDATIONS ON SUBMISSIONS ON BILL – RECOMMENDED TO BE DECLINED The following table lists technical and drafting issues raised in submissions that officials recommend be declined. 38 39 Parts C to E – Recomme nd to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That subclaus e CB 30(2) is in error as it does not restrict its application to association rebates determined by reference to payments that would be taken into account in determining the member’s gross income. Officials note that this submission appears to be in relation to clause CB 33(2) rather than cl ause CB 30. Officials consider that the concluding wording of clause CB 33(1) deals with this issue. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That for great er clarity, clause DV 19(2)(a) could be substituted with the words “the total amount of association rebates paid to members during the income year”. Subsection (4) could then be deleted. The effect of the section is that the association could never achieve a deduction for more than the profits made through the transactions, so there is no harm in allowing a deduction for the full amount of the association rebate, if less than the formula amount, regardless of whether the rebate can be linked to a mutual transaction or not. Officials consider this is a matter of drafting preference. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That clause DV 19(4) does not clarify the meaning of current section HF 1(2). Officials consider that subclaus e DV 19(4) accurately rewrites section HF 1(2)(a) of the 2004 Act. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That clause DV 19(4) should emphasise more that the deduction is for the amount of association rebates paid to a member in relation to a mutual transaction. Officials consider the section alr eady achieves this objective. Th at the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society In clause DV 19, the reference to BC 4 is circular. This submission appears to be a reference to the Exposure Draft provision, rather than the b ill, as there is no reference to section BC 4 in clause DV 19 of the bill. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society In clause DV 19(6) the words “in subsection (5)” should be added to clarify which formula is being referred to. This appears to be a reference to the Exposure Draft provision, rather than the bill, as there is only one formula in clause DV 19. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society The term “reb ate” should be removed from clause DV 19(7) unless it is intended to refer to an association rebate, in which case the full term should be used. The term “the rebate” used in the provision drafting style is considered to be a clear refe rence to the term “association rebate” appearing earlier in the provision. That the submission be declined. 40 Part F – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That clause FA 3 results in an unintended law change as a result of the deletion of the proviso from the current section FC 3 and that the proviso should be reinserted into the clause. See main body of report. That the submission be declined, but that the relationship of this rule to the current legislative structure and, in particular, the anti-avoidance rule relating to dividend stripping be a priority matter on the tax policy work programme. New Zealand Law Society That in Part F, the alphanumeric system should be followed and no gaps left between subparts. The gaps in the subparts (and the parts) have been left to cater for possible future policy initiatives. This approach will permit more subject matter to be grouped using the two letter alphanumeric style so that the use of three character alphanumeric labels can be avoided. (For example, in the 2004 Act, subparts inserted with similar subject matter include subparts NBA, NBB, and NEA.) That the submission be declined New Zealand Law Society That clause FM 31 should specifically exclude local authorities from the consolidated group rules. Officials note that the wording adopted for clause FM 31(1)(c) follows the wording containe d in the amendment to the definition of “eligible company” in section 155(1) of the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. This new definition in that Act does not state that a company that derives only exempt income includes a local authority that is not a council-controlled organisation. That the submission be declined 41 Part G – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That the refe rence in clause GB 6(2) to the “relevant company” is unc lear since there are two companies referred to in subsection (1). Officials consider that subclaus e (2) sufficiently clearly (in a plain English drafting context) applies to whichever company has become an attributing/qualifying company as a result of the arrangements. Clause GB 6( 1)(b) is clear that either company may be a qualifying company. The policy of this anti-avoidance rule is to disallow entry into the rules for any company if the shares have been subject to an arrangement for the purposes of making them an attributing/qualifying company to defeat the intention and purpose of the rules. That the submission be declined. However, the words “(the relevant company)” should be inserted in clause GB 6(1)(b) after “another company”. New Zealand Law Society That for the sa ke of clarity, “to the extent” should be inserted after “this section applies when” in clause GB 8(1). Officials consider that introdu cing the words “to the extent” are unnecessary as the section identifies the scope adequately without those words. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That a rule dealing with negative amounts should be included in clause GB 29. Current section GC 14C(6) provides that if a reduction results in a negative amount, the amount is not attributable to the working person (person C). Officials consider that the comb ined operation of the rules in this provision mean that a negative amount should not arise. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society In section cl ause GB 47, for the avoidance of doubt, it would be desirable to insert the words “For the purposes of sections GB 45 and GB 46 at the start of both subsections. Section 5 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1999 states that headings to a section are part of the legislation, and the courts have interpreted that provision as applying unless the heading would be inconsistent with the text of the section. The words in this heading are consistent with the text of the section, and so no change is required. In addition, officials consider that it is undesirable to adopt an “avoidance of doubt” drafting style in a plain language approach. A section plainly and clearly expressed is intended to address those boundaries. In addition, the heading to the section indicates that the rule is for the purpose of clauses GB 45 and GB 46. That the submission be declined. 42 Part G – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society In clause GB 48, for the avoidance of doubt, it would be desirable to insert the words “For the purposes of sections GB 45 and GB 46 at the start of both subsections. Section 5 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1999 states that headings to a section are part of the legislation, and the courts have interpreted that provision as applying unless the heading would be inconsistent with the text of the section. The words in this heading are consistent with the text of the section, and so no change is required. In addition, officials consider that it is undesirable to adopt an “avoidance of doubt” drafting style in a plain language approach. A section plainly and clearly expressed is intended to address those boundaries. In addition, the heading to the section indicates that the rule is for the purpose of clauses GB 45 and GB 46. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That subclauses GB 49(1)(b) and (c) should be returned to one subsection to read “the arrangement has an effect that means that a requirement of the definition of returning share transfer is not met so as to defeat the intent and application of this Act”. Officials consider that br eaking the sentence into subparagraphs aids readers in this case as in others. However officials propose that “a purp ose” in subparagraph (c) be replaced by “the effect”. That the submission be declined, but a modification be made to subparagraph (c). New Zealand Law Society Clause GC 2(3) should be clarified to read “section GC 1(3) does not apply to land with standing timber that is subject to a right to take timber”. Officials consider the wording in clause GC 2(3) adequately addresses the matter raised in the submission. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That in clauses GC 7 to GC 11, the proposed definition of a person as a taxpayer is unusual. Taxpayer is already defi ned in clause YA 1. The word is not used as a defined term, but as a shorthand reference for the purposes of a short series of sections. Use of “taxpayer” is intended to help the reader distinguish between the various parties and is pref erable to, say, “Person A”. That the submission be declined. 43 Part H – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That clause HC 1(1)(a) should state that the subpart provides for the taxation of the income derived from trusts. Officials consider that this wordin g is inaccurate, as the trust rules include taxable distributions. The term “taxable distributions” will, in relation to a non-complying trust, include distributions of capital gains of the trust. Offici als are of the view that using the term “distributions” is the most appropriate term for income tax purposes. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That clause HA 7(2) should contain a capacity test. An additional test of capacity is unnecessary. The capacity of the trustee acting in their personal capacity is distinguished from their capacity as a trustee under the defi nition of “trustee” in clause YA 1 (section OB 1 of the 2004 Act). That definition provides: th at “Trustee for a trust,— (i) means the trustee only in the capacity of trustee of the trust; and (ii) includes all trustees, for the time being, of the trust Therefore, it is clear that HA 7(2) cannot apply to a trustee acting in a capacity other than as trustee of the trust. That the submission be declined. 44 Part H – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That in clause HC 14, the transfer of value concept in relation to distributions should be replaced with a list contained in a definition of “distribution”. The drafting approach adopted reflects the style of having a general rule with specific exclusions, rather than a list of inclusions that extend a general term to help a re ader get a clear understanding of the meaning of the definition. The 2004 Act definition of “distribution” is very extensive, with paragraph (a) applying to every vesting of interest in a beneficiary of property of a trust, any payment of property to a beneficiary of a trust, or the application for the benefit of a beneficiary of any property of a trust. In addition, this general conc ept is extended in paragraph (b) of the definition of distribution (2004 Act) to include transfers of property and service transactions between a trustee and beneficiary where the transfer value adopted benefits the beneficiary. The extended meaning includes settlements made by the trustee of the trust for the benefit of the beneficiary if the amount settled would have been either beneficiary income or a taxable distribution or from debts forgiven out of natural love and affection. While subsection (2) of clause HC 14 includes settlements, it is possible that they are already caught by section HC 14(1). This might be one example where the submission has merit. However, that could be drafted around by amending section HC 14(2) to begin: “Despite subsection (1), a settlement for the benefit of a beneficiary is treated as a transfer of value only – ” Neither the submission nor officials have been able to identify any particular situation that would fall outside the current definition that falls within the meaning of transfer of value. In subsection (12), the drafting could be improved by replacing the words after “because” with the words “the person is a beneficiary of the trust”. That the submission be declined, but the drafting in clause HC 14 be clarified New Zealand Law Society In clause HC 15, that the reference to the election under section HZ 2 needs to be included (current HH 4(6)(a)(ii)). Officials consider that this submission is incorrect as the reference to section HH 4(6)(a)(ii) of the 2004 Act is set out in clause HC 25(3), which rewrites section HH 4(6) of the 2004 Act. That the submission be declined. 45 Part H – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That, in clauses HC 16, HC 20 and CW 52, a distribution from a complying trust is not exempt income. It is not income at all but a distribution of corpus, capital gain, or accumulated income which has already been taxed to the trustee. In the bill, to “carve out” distributions from a trust that would otherwise be income in the hands of the beneficiary, it is necessary to treat the distribution as either ex cluded, exempt or non-resident’s foreign-sourced income. This ensu res consistency with the meaning of income and assessable income in the core provisions. At present, the rule in section HH 3(5) of the 2004 Act states distributions of this nature from accumulated income of a complying trust (qualifying trust) are excluded from being income of the beneficiary. This provision exists because a distribution from a trust (not being beneficiary income) could otherwise be income for income tax purposes. Officials consider that a distribution of accumulated income from a complying trust can be income in the hands of the beneficiary in some circumstances, irrespective of the treatment under trust law. An example where this can occur is the payment of a pension from a superannuation fund, which is a complying trust. The provision in section HH 3(5) of the 2004 Act is to ensure that a distribution of this nature is not included in the annual calculation of taxable income of the beneficiary. The policy of section HH 3(5) of the 2004 Act is to ensure that double taxation does not occur. Double taxation would occur as income tax is paid on the trustee income retained , and then again by the beneficiary if the distribution is income. Officials consider that the most appropriate category is exempt income as the policy is that the beneficiary may not have a deduction for expenditure incurred in deriving a distribution from a superannuation fund. No change in outcome is intended. That the submission be declined. 46 Part H – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That in clause HC 27, the transfer of value concept should be removed from the definition of “settlor”. The drafting style adopted is agai n the generalised approach with specific exclusions. If specific exampl es of transfers of property or services are identified, they will be incorporated as an exclusion from the rule. The definition of “settlor” in the 2004 Act is extensive and covers all dispositions by a person to or for the benefit of a trust (in terms of the trust) of property, making available of property at less than market value, services at less than market value. It also extends to a person who uses property or services of a trust for consideration greater than market value, and includes the abstai ning of entering into transactions and also is extended further in specific situations set out in section HH 1. Neither the submission nor officials have been able to identify any particular situation that would fall outside the current definition that falls within the meaning of “transfer of value”. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society In clause HC 29(3), that the word “is” should be changed to “has been” for consistency with current legislation. Also “an income year” should be “the income year”. The corresponding provision in the 2004 Act is section HH 4(5)(a). The relevant wording in that section is “... a settlement is first made ... on the terms of the trust...”. This is the same wording contained in clause HC 29, and therefore offi cials consider the drafting has accurately reflected the existing la w. But officials agree with the submission on the income year. That the submission be declined, but that “an income year” be changed to “the income year”. New Zealand Law Society That in clau se HC 35, the effect of section HH 3A(2) of the 2004 Act has not been included (income tax paid on behalf of a beneficiary) and this should be corrected. Also, the effect of section HH 3F(2A) of the 2004 Act has not been included (balance date of trust) and this should be corrected. Section HH 3A(2) has been rewritten as clause HD 12, and contains the agency rules for trusts. The compare note for clause HD 12 indicates that clause HD 12 relates to section HH 3A(2) of the 2004 Act. Section HH 3F(2A) of the 2004 Act has been rewritten into clause HC 35(3), in the meaning of “minor”. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That the re written clauses HD 15((3) and (4) contain an unintended broadening of the scope of the rule by rendering directors liable for all income tax liabilities the company is unable to meet after the arrangement is entered into, not mattering whether it was an effect of the arrangement that the tax liability was unable to be satisfied. Officials consider that under the plain English drafting style adopted throughout the rewrite of the Act, a first reference to a term is generally preceded by the indefinite article. Subsequent references to that term after the section are normally preceded by a definite article (for example, “the”) indicating a reference back to the original expression of that term. In this context, the term “the tax liability” identified in subclauses (3) and (4) is intended to refer to the term “a tax liability” set out in clause HD 15(1)(b) (and (c)(ii). That the submission be declined. 47 Part H – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That the de finition of “mutual transaction” in clause HE 2 does not need to refer to clause DV 19. Officials consider that the term “mutual transaction” applies for the purpose of clause DV 19 (which rewrites aspects of section HF 1) and that this cross-reference helps the reader link the two sections. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That in subp art HF, there is an inconsistency of terminology: “elect ”, “election” and “electing” should be used throughout. Not “choose”. Officials consider this is a matter of drafting style. For example, the verb “choose” is used to distinguish between the act of making an election from the outcome of the actio n, that is the noun “election”. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society In clause HF 2, it is noted that the provision refers to sections HF 2(2)(c), (3)(c), and (7) of the 2004 Act, which were removed by amendment effective September 2004. Officials note that the provisions referred to were not only repealed, but they were replaced by section 214 of the M ā ori Fisheries Act 2004 with provisions that refer to the entities referred to in the clause. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society In clause HF 4, that the reference to “genuine investment” could cause definitional issues, not guidance. The term “genuine investment” re places the concept of “bona fide investment” used in section HI 4 of the 2004 Act. Officials note that the Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines “bona fide” as meaning “acting or done in good faith; sincere(ly); genuine(ly)”. No change in meaning is intended. Officials note that this term is used elsewhere in the bill without definition as, for example, in clauses DB 56, DC 2 and GB 24. However officials propose a change to remove the tautologous words “carried out in good faith”. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That clause HF 11(2) requir es an acceptance date. Currently no requirement is set out in the drafting. Officials agree that s ection HI 3 of the 2004 Act does not provide a time at which acceptance is required. This outcome results from the amendment to section HI 3 in section 209 of the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 which changed the policy from the date of acceptance to the dates referred to in clause HF 11(2). That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That in clause HR 1, there is no reference to co-trustees; current section HD 1(1)(a) appears to be omitted. The rule in section HD 1(1)(a) of the 2004 Act has been incorporated in the trust rules in section HC 2 (Obligations for joint trustees for calculating income and providing returns). In addition, the definition of “trustee” includes co-trustees. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That clause HR 1 no longer refers to co- trustees. The definition of “trustee” in clau se YA 1 states that the term “trustee” includes all trustees fo r the time being of the trust. Therefore, officials consider it is u nnecessary to refer to co-trustees in this provision. That the submission be declined. 48 Part I – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That section IC 5 should contain an extension of time for an offset election as currently provided by section IG 2(3) of the 2004 Act. The intention is that section IC 5(2)(a) provides for the offset election and IC 5(2)(b) provides for the s ubvention payment election. The time by which the election is to be made is given by section IC 9. IC 9(2) states that the notice of election or payment under IC 5(2) must be given to the Commissioner by ... “the extended return date ... or the later date allowed by the Commissioner.” As a minor drafting correction, the word “either” should be omitted from section IC 5(2). That the submission be declined. 49 Part L – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That section LB 1(2) should only refer to the situation when the particulars of an employer monthly schedule are incorrect and not include when the Commissioner does not receive the employer monthly schedule. The opening words of sec tion LD 1(2) of the 2004 Act require that the Commissioner must have received a monthly schedule before he is able to credit PAYE in the manner set out in section LD 1(2). This wording was inserted by section 126 of the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. It is clear that the monthly schedule is necessary in order for the CIR to correctly apportion PAYE received from employers between the different employees and give the appropriate tax credit to each employee. That the submission be declined, but that the wording be reviewed to ensure that the credit is not permanently denied. New Zealand Law Society That in clau se LB 5, in the list of defined terms: add “replacement payment”. In reviewing this submission, officials have identified that there is no equivalent rule for subclause (2) in the 2004 Act and that subclause (2) should be omitted. That the submission be declined but that subclause (2) be omitted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LE 2, the last item of section LB 2(2B) of the 2004 Act has been omitted (taxpayer whose imputation credit giving rise to the tax credit is category A income of the trustee of a group investment fund). Section LB 2(2B)(d) is referring to a group investment fund to the extent of its category A income. Paragraph (c) of the definition of “company” in clause YA 1 includes a group investment fund to the extent of its category A income. Officials consider that it is unnecessa ry to refer to a group investment fund in this clause as paragraph (a ) of clause LE 2 requires the person to be a company, which includes a group investment fund to the extent of its category A income. This outcome is consistent with the Society’s observations on clause HR 2 that it is desirable to more clearly identify that a gr oup investment fund is treated as a company to the extent of its category A income. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society In clause LE 5, the exception from section LB 1(2) of the 2004 Act is omitted. A beneficiary of a group investment fund in relation to the fund’s category A income is a shareholder. This arises from paragraph (d) of the definition of “share” which treats the beneficiary’s interest in the category A income as a share for the purpose of the Act. As indicated previously, the fund is treated as a company. It is therefore unnecessary to identify that this rule not apply to a beneficiary deriving a distribution from a trust. This approach is also consistent with the Society’s observation made in submissions on clause HR 2 and with the approach for unit trusts. That the submission be declined. 50 Part L – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society In clause LF 3, there is an omission of the exception in current section LB 1(2). A beneficiary of a group investment fund in relation to the fund’s category A income is a shareholder. This arises from paragraph (d) of the definition of “share” which treats the beneficiary’s interest in the category A income as a share for the purpose of the Act. As indicated previously, the fund is treated as a company. It is therefore unnecessary to identify that this rule not apply to a beneficiary deriving a distribution from a trust. This approach is also consistent with the Society’s observation made in submissions on clause HR 2 and with the approach for unit trusts. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society In clause LO 2, there is an omission of the exception in current section LB 1(2). A beneficiary of a group investment fund in relation to the fund’s category A income is a shareholder. This arises from paragraph (d) of the definition of “share” which treats the beneficiary’s interest in the category A income as a share for the pur pose of the Act. It is therefore unnecessary to identify that this rule not apply to this beneficiary. That the submission be declined. 51 Part M – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation Child Poverty Action Group That the legislation in Part M should be redrafted to give effect to the stated purpose of clarifying and simplifying the legislation. The policy underlying the Working For Families Tax Credits is complex. While the drafting for complex policy can be expressed in plain language, experience in drafting rewrite legislation indicates that complex policy inevitably results in complex legislation. This can be illustrated by refere nce to Part O which sets out the rules for memorandum accounts where comple x policy is also addressed. The target audience of the rewrite was identif ied in the discussion document, paragraph 3.3 of Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Objectives, process, guidelines , issued in December 1994: “Regardless of how readable or user-frie ndly the rewritten Act becomes, taxpayers will usually find it easier to obtain elsewhere the tax-related information they need. Such taxpayers will still benefit, however, from the rewrite. A rewritten Act that better communicates the law will assist the producer s of secondary sources to better explain the laws.” The discussion document then identified, in paragraph 3.4, that “the primary audience for the Act itself will comprise groups such as: • the courts; • lawyers and accountants (p articularly tax specialists); • authors of secondary sources that explain the application of tax laws; • Members of Parliament; • tax policy analysts and people who want to make submissions on proposed legislation.” This policy remains the basis on which the drafting of the Income Tax Bill has been prepared. We note that Inland Revenue has on its website a series of pages dedicated to explaining entitlements and obligations in relation to the Working for Families Tax Credits that fulfils the objective of having secondary sources explain the application of tax laws to “the disadvantaged members of th e community”. This site is also supported by a dedicated website “Working For Famili es Tax Credit,” a jo int project between Inland Revenue and Work and Income. That the submission be declined. Child Poverty Action Group That clause MA 7(1)(c) be omitted from the bill. This clause defines “full-time earner” which is relevant to eligibility for the in-work payment and the family tax credit. Both of these assistance measures are based on household income. Subclause MA 7(1)(c) accu rately rewrites paragraph (a)(iii) of the definition of “full-time earner” in the 2004 Act. That the submission be declined but officials should review the draft to improve readability. 52 Part M – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation Child Poverty Action Group That paragraphs (ii) and (iii) should be removed from clause MC 6(b). The submitter offers no reason why these paragraphs should be removed. The context of the submission suggests that the submitter disagrees with the policy. The rewrite of the Act is not intended to be a forum where po licy matters such as this are considered. Clause MC 6(b) rewrites the proviso to the definition of “qualifying person” in section KD 3(1) of the 2004 Ac t. That proviso states that a pe rson is not entitled to receive the Family Tax Credit if the person is in receipt of any income-tested benefit, a veterans pension or a war widows mothers’ allowance (now termed parent’s allowance under section 32(2)) of the War Pensions Act). The change in terminology from war widows mothers’ allowance reflects the amendments to the War Pensions le gislation in the War Pensions Amendment Act 1988. The cross- reference in the Income Tax Act was not picked up at that time. That the submission be declined. Child Poverty Action Group That clause MD 2(2)(c) should reverse the order of subparagraphs (i) and (ii); (i) first reduces the amount of the in-work payment before the reduction of the amount of the family support. Officials consider that the or der of the calculation in subp aragraph (c) of clause MD 2(2) replicates the equivalent provision (section KD 2A of the 2004 Act). Officials consider that this matter is not an issue that is able to be addressed in the rewrite project. That the submission be declined. Child Poverty Action Group That in clause MD 9(4), the denial of the in-work payment to any family where the accident occurred before January 2006 is agai nst the spirit of the ACC Act, highly discriminatory and unjust. The exclusion from in-work payment of recipients of earnings-related compensation paid as a result of incapacity that arose be fore 1 January 2006 follows the provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004. They had been eligible for the Child Tax Credit only for the first three months of eligibility for compensation. Officials consider that the reve rsal of that policy is not an issue that is able to be addressed in the rewrite project. That the submission be declined. Child Poverty Action Group That clause MD 11(1)(b)(i) be amended to replace “social assistance payment” with “income-tested benefit” and not include ACC or non-income tested benefits. The subparagraph rewrites section KD 2AB(1 )(a) of the 2004 Act. The term “social assistance payment” replaces the term “specifi ed payment”. The new term is intended to provide the reader with a better indication of the nature of the payments termed “specified payments” in the 2004 Act. The types of payments included within th e meaning of the term “social assistance payment” are set out in clause MA 8. This list of payments accurately replicates the list of payments included in the meaning of “specified payment” in the 2004 Act. One of the types of payments listed is “i ncome-tested benefit”. To replace “social assistance payment” with the term “income- tested benefit” would narrow the meaning and so result in an unintended change in policy. That the submission be declined. 53 Part M – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation Child Poverty Action Group In clause MF 7, that family plus components should not be able to be adjusted beyond the increase in the Consumer Price Index as allowed for family support. This submission is concerned with the policy intention of the family plus rules. Officials consider this is a policy matter not able to be considered in rewriting the provisions. That the submission be declined. Child Poverty Action Group That the clauses in Part M relating to the in-work payment be rewritten to be consistent with principle of the Child Support Act relating to material standards of living following parental separation. This submission is concerned with the policy intention of the in-work payment rules. Officials consider this is a policy matter not able to be considered in rewriting the provisions. That the submission be declined. 54 Part O – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the use of tables in Part O is a different style from the rest of the Income Tax Bill and is a departure from the drafting guidelines. The submitter notes that the use of tables is supported where the subject matter is complicated or repetitious and would be better presented in tabular form. Officials consider that Part O contains legislation that is complex and repetitious, and that tables assist the reader to access the text of the legislation. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 1 omits a reference to the trustee company rule fr om current ME 1(3). Officials consider this is unnecessa ry as the definition of “trustee” in clause YA 1 makes clear that a trustee acting in their personal capacity is distinct from the trustee capacity. That the submission be declined. 55 Part R – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants Subpart RC – That sections MB 26, MB 28 and MB 36 of the 2004 Act be inserted into the bill. Officials noted that section MB 26 duplicates provisions in the Goods and Services Tax Act and sections MB 28 and MB 36 replicate provisions in the Tax Administration Act. These provisions are therefore unnecessary in the cont ext of the Income Tax Act. That the submission be declined. 56 Part Y – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That a definition from other legislation should be replicated in the Income Tax Act instead of defining the term by cross-reference to the primary (other) legislation. The drafting practice of adopting a specialised definition from other Acts of Parliament is addressed in the Parliamentary Counsel Office’s Drafting Manual . Paragraphs 5.257 to 5.258 of the manual states that “it is important to be aware of not redefining terms that should have a consistent meaning across the statut e book. The correct approach is to adopt the specialised definition – for example, “medical practitioner” as defined in section 5 of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 ... A definition contained in the Interpretation Act 1999 should not be repeated in other enactments.” The main purpose of this drafting practice is to ensure that when a specialised definition in its primary legislation is amended, that revised meaning applies immediatel y across the statute book. This overcomes the very real risk of error that can occur when an Act of Parliament replicates instead of cross-referring to specialised definitions in other legislation. Officials consider that this practice assists the reader by ensuring that the correct meaning of a specialised term is always contained in the Income Tax Act. Therefore, in draftin g income tax legislation, there is no reason to depart from the drafting practice mandated by the Parliamentary Counsel Office. That the submission be declined, although a reference to the Interpretation Act and, in particular, the definition of “person” in that Act could be inserted in Part A to assist the reader. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the use of acronyms is not recommended for income tax legislation. A definition is used to give a standard meaning to words or phrases that occur frequently throughout the bill. Officials consider the use of acronyms is a common feature in everyday income tax practice. The use of acronyms assists the reader by avoiding repetition of long phrases in the text of the legislation, and is easier to read. For example, a PCA company stands for the phrase “a policyholder credit account company”. Similarly, when the fringe benefit tax rules were introduced in 1985, the term FBT was quickly adopted in everyday language. Resident with holding tax very quickly became known as RWT. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants In clause YA 1, in the definition of “adjusted tax value”, the reference to paragraphs (a) and (b) in clause FO 16 is confusing and should be more specific and refer to paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause FO 16(3). Officials agree that a reference shou ld be specific and clear. However, in this case, which relates to the adjusted tax value of a pool of depreciable property, the reference is to paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition. However, some redrafting can make that clearer. That the submission be declined, but some redrafting will clarify the linkage. 57 Part Y – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That in clause YA 1 the defined term “person” should be defined fully in the Income Tax Bill or, alternatively, the definition in section 29 of the Interpretation Act 1999 should be referred to in a definition of “person” in the bill. Paragraph 5.258 of the Parliamentary Counsel Office’s Drafting Manual states: “... A definition contained in the Interpretation Act 1999 should not be repeated in other enactments.” The reason for this drafting style is that the Interpretation Act 1999 is intended to apply to every Act of Parliament and so collects together terms that are intended to have a common meaning across the entire statute book. An underlying presumption of the Interpretation Act 1999 is that the users of any legi slation are expected to know the existence and content of this Act. Officials consider that defining te rms in other legislation that are defined within the Interpretation Act 1999 undermines the purpose of the Interpretation Act. Officials consider it is inappropriate generally for income tax legislation to depart from this statute-wide drafting practice unless there is a compelling reason. “Per son” was not defined (except for limited purposes) in the Income Tax Act 2004. However, officials propose a reference in Part A to the Interpretation Act and its definition of “person”. That the submission be declined, but that a reference be made in Part AA to the Interpretation Act and, in particular, to that Act’s definition of “person” 58 59 TABLE OF OFFICIALS’ RECOMMENDED CHANGES Officials recommend that the submissions listed in the following table be accepted. The submissions fall into four types, as explained below. 1. Drafting changes required as a result of enactments passed since the bill was introduced. Examples include: • KiwiSaver Act 2006. • Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. 2. Drafting changes to increase the consistency of the language and layout. Examples include: • Putting blocks of text into subclauses or paragraphs to improve readability. • Using a single expression instead of two or more expressions of the same meaning. 3. Correcting drafting problems identified by officials. Examples include: • In clause HD 26(1), omitting “gross” from the term “gross income”. • In clause RA 22, omitting subclause (1) as being unnecessary and, in the list of defined terms to clause RA 22, omit “income tax”. 4. Drafting changes arising as a result of officials consulting with advisors to the Finance and Expenditure Committee. 60 61 Changes from 2006 amending legislation Submission Comment Recommendation Insert clause CB 25B.

1 OFFICIALS’ REPORT ON PARTS 5 AND 6 OF THE LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS BILL: TAX ASPECTS November 2007 Prepared by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue 2 OFFICIALS’ REPORT ON THE LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS BILL: INTRODUCTION This is the officials’ report on Parts 5-6 of the Limited Partnerships Bill, dealing with the tax aspects of the bill. The report is divided into three parts – a covering report (Part A), a clause by clause analysis (Part B), and an annex providing further information that the Committee has requested (Part C). Along with the introduction of limited partnership vehicles, the bill introduces new tax rules for limited partnerships and updates the tax rules for general partnerships. If the proposed regulatory rules were to be introduced without any change to the income tax legislation, a limited partnership would be characterised as a “company” for income tax purposes. As a result, income and expenses would not flow through the partnership to be taxed at partner level but would instead be taxed at the company level. The bill will ensure that the limited partnership will not be taxed. Instead, each partner will be subject to tax individually, in the same way that income from general partnerships is taxed. The bill also proposes that a limited partner’s tax loss in any given year will be restricted to the amount that the partner has at risk in the limited partnership. The introduction of a new limited partnership vehicle also highlights some problems around the current taxation of general partnerships. To resolve these problems, the bill clarifies and modernises the tax treatment of partnerships generally. The new rules also cover tax aspects of entering and leaving all partnerships, whether general or limited. They include requiring exiting partners to account for tax in certain circumstances and clarifying the extent to which selling partners must realise gains on underlying partnership assets. Partners will be required to account for tax on exiting a partnership essentially only if they have earned more than $50,000 profit from the disposal, and the carve-outs don’t apply. This is designed to reduce compliance costs. The covering report (Part B) addresses key policy issues raised by submitters and officials. These are: • Deemed dissolution of the partnership for tax purposes where there is a 50% change in ownership • Transactions between partners deemed to be at market value • Anti-streaming rule • Loss limitation rule for limited partners • Amendments should be made to the Income Tax Act 2007, not the Income Tax Act 2004 3 The clause by clause analysis (Part B) includes these key policy issues, and also deals with other technical issues raised by submitters and officials. The annex (Part C) provides further information that the committee has requested on loss attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs). 4 OFFICIALS’ REPORT ON THE LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS BILL: TAX ASPECTS PART A COVERING REPORT D EEMED DISSOLUTION OF PARTNERSHIP AT 50% CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP (CLAUSE 116, HD 3) Existing legislation is generally silent on the tax consequences of dissolving a partnership. The proposed new rules are intended to provide certainty about the tax treatment that applies in these circumstances. Proposed new section HD 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004 will therefore deem the partnership to have disposed of all its assets at market value for tax purposes on dissolution. When there is a 50 percent or more change in the partnership ownership within 12 months there will be a deemed disposal of all of the partnership property for tax purposes. This was to prevent large asset transfers that give rise to significant deferral of tax liabilities. A partnership will not automatically be treated as dissolving for tax purposes when there is a smaller change in partnership interests. Submitters were concerned that a deemed dissolution at an ownership change of 50% over 12 months is not appropriate, as the operation of the rule is not sufficiently clear. Officials’ comment The rule deeming a partnership to dissolve when there was a 50% change in ownership over 12 months was designed to prevent partners effectively selling their underlying assets in the partnership by transferring their partnership interest to another partner for the value of the underlying asset. However, if the transaction results in a greater than $50,000 profit the transferring partner will be taxed on the profit. Officials therefore consider that the provision is not necessary and can be removed. Officials consider that a deemed sale and reacquisition by all partners at market value should instead occur when the partnership dissolves through the agreement of partners, or through operation of law by which fewer than two parties remain or by an order of the court. This is necessary to ensure that there is not a permanent avoidance of tax on partnership assets. 5 TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN PARTNERS MUST BE AT MARKET VALUE (CLAUSE 116, GD 16) Proposed section GD 16 of the Income Tax Act provides that transactions between partners (except salary payments) will be treated as being at market value for tax purposes. Submitters argued that this rule should be removed, as this is a departure from existing law and practice and it can be difficult to determine market value. Officials’ comment This requirement was designed to protect the tax base. Officials were concerned that assets could be transferred in and out of a partnership, under- and over-value, for tax benefits. For example, a controlling partner could introduce valuable assets into a partnership to accelerate their own tax deductions. However, officials agree with submitters that this rule should not affect situations where non-market transactions between partners occur legitimately. Applying the rule in these circumstances could result in high compliance costs. Officials therefore recommend replacing this rule with a specific anti-avoidance rule that essentially deems a transaction to have occurred at market value where the transaction is subject to an arrangement entered into to avoid tax. This should strike an appropriate balance between the integrity of the tax system and the compliance cost concerns of the submitters. A NTI-STREAMING RULE (CLAUSE 116, HD 2(2)) In its review or the tax rules, the Valabh Committee 1 noted that the current legislation is generally silent on the apportionment of income, expenses tax credits, rebates, gains, or losses that flow through to partners. The proposed rule in HD 2(2) follows the Valabh Committee’s recommended proportionate approach by ensuring that these items are generally allocated to the partners in proportion to each partner’s share in the partnership’s income. Partners are therefore not able to “stream” different types of income to individual partners. Submitters argued that this rule should be removed, as there may be commercial reasons why items are allocated to partners in different proportions. 1 Key reforms to the scheme of tax legislation, the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (“Valabh Committee”), 1991. 6 Officials’ comment This rule ensures that different types of income cannot be streamed to take advantage of the different tax circumstances of the partners. In the absence of anti-streaming rules, certain types of income that is exempt from tax (such as capital gains) can be disproportionately allocated to partners on higher marginal tax rates, and taxable income can be allocated taxpayers on lower marginal tax rates or who are exempt from paying tax - such as a charity - in order to reduce the amount of tax that would normally be payable. The following example illustrates the issue: Two partners each own 50% of a business. Partner A is on a marginal tax rate of 39%, and Partner B is a taxpayer who is exempt from paying tax. The business earns $100 of taxable income and $100 of capital gains (non-taxable income). 1. If the profit is distributed proportionately, Partner A will have $50 of taxable income and $50 of capital gains income. Partner A’s tax liability will be: Taxable income: $50 x 39% = $19.50 Capital gains (non-taxable income): $50 x 0 = $0. Partner B’s tax liability will be: Taxable income: $50 x 0% = $0 Capital gains (non-taxable income): $50 x 0 = $0. Total tax payable is $19.50. 2. If the partners were allowed to stream the profits to take advantage of their different circumstances, they could ensure that the exempt income is disproportionately allocated to the partner on the higher marginal rate. For example, if all the taxable income is streamed to Partner B (the exempt partner), and all the capital gains are streamed to Partner A (the partner on 39% marginal rate): Partner A’s tax liability will be: Taxable income: $0 x 39% = $0. Capital gains (non-taxable income): $100 x 0 = $0. Partner B’s tax liability will be: Taxable income: $100 x 0% = $0. Capital gains (non-taxable income): $0 x 0 = $0. No tax is paid in this instance. 7 Tax could similarly be reduced by disproportionately allocating taxable income to a taxpayer on lower marginal tax rates, and allocating non- taxable income to partners on higher marginal tax rates. L OSS LIMITATION (CLAUSE 116, HD 11) Proposed section HD 11 of the Income Tax Act ensures that any loss that a limited partner claims does not exceed the amount that the limited partner has at risk in the partnership. Submitters argued that this rule should be removed to encourage investment in venture capital, and because they considered that it conflicted with the normal tax treatment for losses. Officials’ comment Without these rules, limited partnerships would provide opportunities for taxpayers to receive tax deductions in excess of the expenditure that they personally have at risk in the partnership. This is because the losses of the partnership would flow through to partners, but the partners would only be liable for the capital that they have contributed to the partnership. The rationale for restricting a limited partner’s tax losses in any given year is to ensure that the tax losses claimed reflect the level of that person’s economic loss. Given that limited partners will have limited liability on their limited partnership interest, they will not have exposure to losses greater than the amount of their investment in any year. It is therefore an appropriate policy result to allow limited partners to offset, for tax purposes, only the tax losses to which they have exposure. A MENDMENTS SHOULD BE MADE TO INCOME TAX ACT 2007 The amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 should be replaced with amendments to the newly enacted Income Tax Act 2007. Officials’ comment The Income Tax Act 2007 received Royal Assent on 1 November 2007. The 2007 Act rewrites the income tax legislation into plain language, and repeals the Income Tax Act 2004. The Income Tax Act 2007 commences on 1 April 2008. In the officials’ report on Parts 1-4 of the Limited Partnerships Bill, MED are recommending that the Limited Partnerships Act 2007 also commences on 1 April 2008. Officials therefore recommend that the current provisions relating to the Income Tax Act should be replaced with provisions relating to the Income Tax Act 2007. 8 PART B CLAUSE BY CLAUSE ANALYSIS Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response General comments 1 The aggregate approach adopted in the proposed legislation for taxing partnerships is inappropriate and should be changed to an entity approach. Under this approach, the assessability and deductibility of income and expenditure would be first tested at the entity level, and then tested at the partner level to determine whether any exemptions or modifications apply. NZICA (page 11), KPMG (pages 2-4) Disagree. The proposals ai m to codify the current tax treatment of partnerships, which is more closely aligned with the aggregate approach of treating each partner as the owner of a fraction of all the assets of the partnership for tax purposes. This partnership does not exist independently from the partners. The rules attempt to provide a reasonable balance between the integrity and accuracy of this flow-t hrough mechanism provided by the aggregate approach, and the administrative and compliance convenience of the entity approach. 2 Drafting The proposed legislation is too prescriptive. Corporate Taxpayers Group (page 8) Noted. The proposals aim to codify the current tax treatment of partnerships, and aim to remove uncertainty. A natural and unavoidable consequence of this is that in some circumstances, the legislat ion is too prescriptive. 3 Defined terms All limited partnership terms that are not defined terms in the Income Tax Act 2004 should be referenced to the appropriate Limited Partnerships Bill definition. NZICA (page 8) This is a drafting issue that has been noted. 9 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response Section CX 35 ITA 4 Position of Lloyd’s underwriters under UK Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 It is not clear how Lloyd’s underwriters under the United Kingdom’s Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 will be treated for New Zealand tax purposes. This should be clarified. NZICA (page 6) Noted. The Limited Partnerships Bill will treat foreign entities with limited liability status as companies for New Zealand tax purposes. If New Zealand resident individuals who currently invest through unincorporated bodies (such as Lloyd’s underwriters) incorporate, they will be subject to the current tax rules for investments in overseas companies (that is, generally fair dividend rate). The exemption from tax in section CX 35 will not apply. Clause 115, GD 16 5 Transactions between partners of the partnership Does not support introduction of the blanket “market value rule” in proposed section GD 16 for transactions between partners of a partnership. PwC (page 6), Deloitte (pages 7-8), Corporate Taxpayers Group (page 4), NZICA (page 16-17) Agree in part. It should be made explicit that this is an anti-avoidance rule, and should not deem all transactions to occur at market value. 6 Transactions between partners of the partnership If proposed section GD 16 enacted, leases between partnerships should be excluded from its scope. PwC (page 6) Disagr ee. See above. 7 Transactions between partners of the partnership If proposed section GD 16 is enacted in its current form section GD 10 of the ITA should be amended to exclude leases of property between partners and the partnership. PwC (page 7) Disagree. Section GD 10 is an objective rule. Conversely, the new anti-avoidance rule proposed is a subjective rule designed to apply more broadly. 10 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response 8 Transactions between partners of the partnership It should be clarified whether proposed section GD 16 is meant to apply to transactions between partners acting as members of the partnership, or to transactions between the partnership and partners not acting as partners. Minter Ellison Rudd Watts (page 1), New Zealand Law Society (page 9), NZVIF (page 22) Agree in part. It should be made explicit that this is an anti-avoidance rule, and should not deem all transactions to occur at market value. Clause 116, HD 2 9 Intention of partnership Guidance should be provided on how the intention of the partnership or partners, as per section HD 2(1)(a) is to be determined. Minter Ellison Rudd Watts (page 2), NZVIF (page 23), KPMG (page 4) Noted. The submission raises an interesting point, however officials consider that it should not present a problem in practice, as the status, intention and purpose of the partnership can be derived from a range of factors including the partnership agreement and the nature of the partnership’s business. 10 Anti-streaming rule The last word in proposed section HD 2(2) should be changed from “income” to “profit” to make it consistent with the Partnership Act 1908 which refers to the partner’s share in “capital and profits”. PwC (page 9), NZICA (page 14) This is a drafting issue that has been noted. 11 Anti-streaming rule The term “gain” should be clarified to confirm it includes capital gain amounts. NZICA (page 14) Disagree. A capita l gain amount is, by its very nature, a gain. 12 Anti-streaming rule The section should be clarified to address how it would apply if there was negative income. NZICA (page 15) Agree. Section HD 2(2) should be amended to confirm that it applies to partnership losses. 13 Anti-streaming rule The partnership agreement should override the flow-through provision where capital gains are derived by the partnership and the partnership agreement allocates capital gains to partners that were in the partnership when the asset was acquired. PwC (page 9) Disagree. This would represent an exception to the anti-streaming rule in section HD2(2) and would difficult to administer. 11 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response 14 Anti-streaming rule Proposed section HD 2(2) should be removed from the Bill. Minter Ellison Rudd Watts (page 3), NZICA (page 13), NZVIF (page 24), KPMG (page 5) Disagree. The proposed anti-streaming rule is designed to provide a specific prohibition on the streaming of different types of income, credits and deductions to different categories of partner in order to gain tax benefits. Relying on the general anti-avoidance rule in the area would result in uncertainty. 15 Anti-streaming rule The relationship between the anti-streaming rule in proposed section HD 2(2) and the “stepping-in” rule in pr oposed sections HD 5 to HD 10 should be clarified. Minter Ellison Rudd Watts (page 4), NZVIF (page 27) Agree. This can be addressed by ensuring that proposed section HD 2(2) does not apply to interests acquired from disposals which resulted in a gain or loss being recognised by the disposing partner. 16 Expenditure incurred before partner was a partner Support the proposal in section HD 2(3) to allow new partners a deduction for partnership expenditure incurred prior to the partner being admitted to the partnership. The words “may be” should be replaced with the word “is”. PwC (page 10), NZICA (page 15) Officials disagree with the submission that the words “may be” should be replaced with the word “is”. 17 Expenditure incurred before partner was a partner The provision should ensure that the deduction is allocated to either the exiting or the incoming partner. The deduction should not be available to both. Officials’ submission Agree. 18 Expenditure incurred before partner was a partner The provision should be clarified to ensure that it does not prevent an exiting partner being able to claim expenses up until the date of disposal to the entering partner. NZICA (page 15) Disagree. Official s consider that the provision already achieves this result. 19 Expenditure incurred before partner was a partner The relationship of section HD 2(3) and the general deductibility rule should be clarified. NZICA (page 15) Noted. This prov ision only addresses a particular technical issue concerning incurrence. All the other rules for deductions must still be met. This rule would override sections HD 4 – HD 10. 12 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response Clause 116, HD 3 20 Dissolution of a partnership when greater than 50% disposal of partners’ interests. The proposed section HD 3 which deems the partnership to dissolve when interests of 50% or more are disposed of in a 12 month period should be removed. PwC (page 11), Minter Ellison Rudd Watts (page 4), Deloitte (page 8), New Zealand Law Society (page 10), Corporate Taxpayers Group (page 5), NZVIF (page 25), NZICA (page 21), KMPG (page 6) Agree. This rule was designed to prevent partners effectively selling their underlying assets in the partnership by transferring their partnership interest to another partner for the value of the underlying asset. However, provided the transaction results in a greater than $50,000 profit the transferring partner will be taxed on the profit. Therefore, the provision is not necessary and can be removed. 21 Dissolution of partnership Officials consider that a deemed sale and reacquisition by all partners at market value should occur when the partnership dissolves through the agreement of partners or through operation of law by which fewer than 2 parties remain or by an order of the court. Officials’ submission Agree. This is necessary to ensure that there is not a permanent avoidance of tax on partnership assets held on revenue account. Clause 116, HD 4 and HD 5 22 Sections HD 4 and HD 5 – disallowance of disposing partner deductions and income attribution It should be clarified that sections HD 4(2) and (3) and HD 5(3) and (6) are intended to apply to both income and deductions of the acquiring partner. The actual deductions incurred and income derived by the disposing partner up to the time of disposal ought to be available to that partner. Bell Gully (page 1) Noted. Officials consider that this result is already achieved by the provisions but will consider whether the drafting can be made any clearer. 13 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response Clause 116, HD 4 23 Disposal of partner’s interest within the partnership The title to this provision should be amended to read, “adjustment of rights to profits within partnership” New Zealand Law Society (page 10) Noted. 24 Disposal of partner’s interest within the partnership The phrase contained in proposed section HD 4(1) “disposes of some or all of their partner’s interest” should be replaced with the phrase “disposes of some of their partner’s interest”. PwC (page 13), NZICA (page 20), KPMG (page 8), Bell Gully (page 1) Agree. This is a drafting error that should be rectified as suggested by the submission. 24 Disposal of partner’s interest within the partnership Proposed section HD 4 should be amended to remove the criterion that the section will apply if no consideration is paid or payable. KPMG (page 7) Disagree. Section HD 4 is intended only to apply to disposals of partners’ interests where no consideration has been provided. 26 Disposal of partner’s interest within the partnership The proposed section HD 4 should be amended to provide consistency in references to the partner’s partnership interest. PwC (page 14) Agree. This is a drafting error that should be rectified as suggested by the submission. 27 Disposal of partner’s interest within the partnership The application of secti on HD 4 in the situation where a new partner contributes new capital to the partnership, or withdraws that capital on exit, should be clarified. Minter Ellison Rudd Watts (page 4), NZVIF (page 26) Noted. Officials consider that the proposed legislation can be interpreted to achieve the correct policy result, but will reconsider the drafting to see if it can be made any clearer. Clause 116, HD 5 – HD 9 28 Sections HD 5 - HD 9. NZICA is pleased that realistic partial relief rules have been included as they will result in a saving in compliance costs. NZICA (page 24) Noted. 14 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response 29 Sections HD 5 - HD 9. The mechanism for electing whether sections HD 5-HD 9 apply should be stated. The preferred approach would be for the election to be made in the partnership return. NZICA (page 22) Agree. 30 Sections HD 5 – HD 9. To make the exit rules work appropriately there should be a requirem ent that the exiting partner provide information about their tax status to the partnership. NZICA (page 22) Disagree. Shari ng information when businesses are bought and sold is a current commercial issue. 31 Undertaking actual tax calculations to determine tax liabilities on entry or exit When partners enter or exit a partnership they should have the option of applying the entry or exit rules proposed in sections HD 5 to HD 10. Corporate Taxpayers Group (page 6) Disagree. To provide the option of electing into sections HD 6 to HD 10 would provide opportunities for inappropriate “cherry picking” of tax treatment. Clause 116, HD 5 32 Disposal of partner’s interest for $50,000 or less profit Supports the increase in threshol d to $50,000. NZICA (page 21), KPMG (page 8) Noted. 33 Disposal of partner’s interest for $50,000 or less profit The formula in section HD 5 should be removed and replaced with a simple written rule that provides that a partner is required to account for tax on exit only if the proceeds exceed the total net tax book value of the partner’s share of partnership property by more than $50,000. PwC (page 15), NZICA (page 21) Disagree. The provisions are structured so that section HD 5 is an exception to the general rule in section HD 2 that partners must account for tax when they exit a partnership. 15 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response 34 Amendments to formula in section HD 5 The formula in section HD 5(1) should be amended to provide additional clarification – namely: • The reference to “interests” in subsection (2)(a) should be replaced with a reference to “current interests” to make it consistent with subsection (1). • The formula in section HD 5(1) is intended to operate on all the partner’s disposals that have occurred in the last 12 months. Therefore the references to “current interests” and “previous interests” should be replaced with a reference to “all disposals in the last 12 months”. PwC (page 15), NZICA (page 21) Agree with first submission. Agree with second submission. 35 Consequences of section HD 5 not applying. The proposed section HD 5 should be amended to state the consequences of the section not applying. PwC (page 16) Disagree. The prov isions are structured so that section HD 5 is an exception to the general rule that partners must account for tax when they exit a partnership. 36 Section HD 5 disposal of partner’s interest Section HD 5(2)(c) should be amended to refer to “cost” not “value”. Also, it should be amended to refer to the cost of the partnership property/assets, not the cost of the interest New Zealand Law Society (page 10) Disagree with the first point. It is appropriate to use the adjusted tax book value of the asset disposed of as this provides an accurate calculation of the profit. The second point is noted. 37 Section HD 5 disposal of partner’s interest Section HD 5(2)(b) should be written as a specific anti-avoidance rule and applied at the discretion of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. NZICA (page 22) Disagree. The pr ovision is designed so that taxpayers can self-assess whether or not the rule applies. 16 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response 38 Section HD 5 disposal of partner’s interest Section HD 5 should state that the section does not apply if any of sections HD 6-HD 9 apply. NZICA (page 22) Disagree. The prov isions are structured as stand- alone rules and it is clear that sections HD 6-HD 9 can apply even if the $50,000 threshold in section HD 5 is exceeded. 39 Section HD 5 disposal of partner’s interest Section HD 5(4) should clarify that it only applies if the $50,000 threshold is not breached. NZICA (page 22) Disagree. Section HD 5(1) provides the necessary clarification as it states that section HD 5 only applies if the $50,000 threshold is breached. 40 Section HD 5 disposal of partner’s interest The definition of “net adjusted tax value of partnership property” in section HD 5(2)(c) should only measure tangible things. NZICA (page 23) Disagree. 41 Section HD 5 disposal of partner’s interest That the word “adjusted” be removed from the term “net adjusted tax value of partnership property” as it is superfluous. NZICA (page 23) Disagree. 42 Definition of “year” The term “year” should be included in the list of defined terms in proposed section HD 5. PwC (page 16) Agree. Clause 116, HD 6 43 Section HD 6 – disposal of trading stock Supports the de minimis threshold of $3 million for the exiting partner to account for income/loss on their share of partnership trading stock. Also supports the option for partnerships of five or less partners to choose whether or not to account for changes in partnership interest in trading stock. KPMG (page 9) Noted. 44 Section HD 6 – disposal of trading stock Clarify that the provision applies when the turnover of the partnership is less than $3 million. NZICA (page 24) This is a drafting point that has been noted. 45 Section HD 6 – disposal of trading stock Exiting partners of farming partnerships should have the option of using the relief under HD 6. NZICA (page 24) Disagree. Livestock is not necessarily turned over quickly. Therefore the applic ation of this provision could result in significant tax deferral. 17 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response 46 Section HD 6 – disposal of trading stock Section HD 6(5) is not effective in providing a deduction to the entering partner – as purported by section HD 6(3). The deduction would arise under the general deductibility or trading stock rules. NZICA (page 25) Disagree. Officials consider that the rules operate appropriately as currently drafted. Clause 116, HD 7 47 Section HD 7 – disposal of depreciable property Supports the de minimis threshold of an original cost price of $200,000 for the exiting partner to account for income/loss on their share of depreciable property (excluding depreciable intangible property). KPMG also supports the option to not apply the provision to small partnerships. KPMG (page 9) Noted. 48 Section HD 7 – disposal of depreciable property Section HD 7(5) is not effective in providing a deduction to the entering partner – as purported by section HD 7(3). Does the deduction more appropriately arise under the depreciation rules? NZICA (page 25) Disagree. Officials consider that the provisions operate appropriately as currently drafted. 49 Section HD 7 – disposal of depreciable property The relief provided by section HD 7 should apply if the depreciated value (rather than historical cost) of the item in question is $200,000 or less. NZICA (page 25) Disagree. Using t he depreciated value rather than historical cost could allow partners to avoid recognising their depreciation recapture. 50 Section HD 7 – disposal of depreciable property That depreciable intangible property should be included as depreciable property for relief under section HD 7. NZICA (page 25) Disagree. Including intangible property as depreciable property for relief under section HD 7 could result in significant revenue risk. 18 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response Clause 116, HD 8 51 Section HD 8 – disposal of financial arrangements That exiting partners should not have to perform a base price adjustment (BPA) for all financial arrangements held by the partnership. NZICA (page 26) Disagree. If this submission were accepted it could result in significant deferral of tax for partnerships that are in the business of trading financial arrangements. It should be noted that a BPA will not be required for most financial arrangements. 52 Section HD 8 – disposal of financial arrangements Section HD 8(1)(b) should be amended so it refers to the partners not deriving income from the partnership from a business of holding financial arrangements. New Zealand Law Society (page 10), NZVIF (page 28) Agree. This amendment will clarify that the proposed section HD 8 app lies provided that the partnership is not in the business of holding financial arrangements. 53 Section HD 8 – disposal of financial arrangements It is not clear whether the proposed section HD 8(3) overrides the requirement in the financial arrangements rules for the exiting partner to calculate the base price adjustment (BPA) and the allowance of a deduction if the result of the BPA is a negative amount. KPMG (page 9) Agree. The provisions should be clarified to ensure that an exiting partner does not perform a base price adjustment in relation to financial arrangements covered by this section. 54 Section HD 9 – short-term agreements NZICA agrees with the proposed provision. NZICA (page 26), KPMG (page 10) Noted. Clauses 116, 106 and 109 (HD 10, CB 23B and DO 5C) 55 Section HD 10 – disposal of specified livestock An entering partner should be allowed to opt out of the five year spreading method PwC (page 22) Agree. This is achieved under section HD 10(3). 19 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response 56 Section HD 10 – disposal of specified livestock Extend section CB 23B to non-specified livestock. NZICA (page 27) Agree. 57 Section HD 10 – disposal of specified livestock Section HD 10 should not apply to livestock valued under the National Herd Scheme. Officials’ submission Agree. See below. 58 Section HD 10 – disposal of specified livestock Sections CB 23B and DO 5C should be amended to generate appropriate outcomes where a partner enters the partnership part-way through an income year PwC (page 21) Disagree. Officials consider that the correct policy result is achieved where a partner enters the partnership part-way through an income year if proposed section HD 10 is amended to ensure it does not apply to livestock valued under the National Herd Scheme. 59 Section HD 10 – disposal of specified livestock Subsections (2) and (3) of proposed sections CB 23B and DO 5C should be included within the timing provisions in Part E of the Income Tax Act 2004. PwC (page 22) This is a drafting issue that has been noted. 60 Section HD 10 – disposal of specified livestock Sections CB 23B and DO 5C should be amended to include a mechanism for the exiting partner to disclose his or her net revenue gain or loss to the entering partner. NZICA (page 27) Disagree. Sharing of information when businesses are bought and sold is a current commercial issue. 61 Section HD 10 – disposal of specified livestock Section HD 10 should be incorporated in sections CB 23B and DO 5C to aid comprehension. NZICA (page 27) This is a drafting issue that has been noted. 62 Section HD 10 – disposal of specified livestock It is not clear that sections CB 23B and DO 5C achieve their policy objectives. NZICA (page 27) Disagree. The pr ovisions achieve the intended result of spreading income and deductions of incoming partners over 5 years. 20 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response 63 Section HD 10 – disposal of specified livestock Section CB 23B should be renumbered as section CB 29 to avoid confusion and to make it consistent with the new rewrite style. NZICA (page 28) This is a drafting issue that has been noted. Clause 116, HD 11 64 Limitation of limited partners’ losses The HD 11 rule that limits a limited partner’s deductions for a year to the amount of their “basis” is unnecessary and should be removed. Deloitte (page 4), Corporate Taxpayers Group (page 6), Kensington Swan (page 4), NZICA (pages 30-31), KPMG (page 10) Disagree. Without these ru les, limited partnerships would provide opportunities for taxpayers to receive tax deductions in excess of the expenditure that they pers onally have at risk in the partnership. This is because the losses of the partnership would flow through to partners, but the partners would only be liable for the capital that they have contributed to the partnership. While the deferred deduction rule that is already part of the tax law could provide some protection to the revenue base its application is more limited. 65 Limitation of limited partners’ losses A limited partner’s basis should also include current year income, as well as past year income. Officials Agree. 66 Limitation of limited partners’ tax losses – derivation of exempt or excluded income Proposed section HD 11 should be amended to ensure a partner is not denied a deduction for a partnership loss in situations where the partner has economic exposure to that loss (as the loss has been funded by exempt or excluded income). PwC (page 17), Deloitte (page 5), Grant Thornton, SKYCITY (page 1), NZICA (page 31) Officials note that excluded income and exempt income are “income” under the core provisions of the Income Tax Act, therefore no amendment is required. Officials have discussed this with one of the submitters, who agrees. Officials also consider that a partner should not receive basis for dividends received from an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund as gains from these interests will have already been included as taxable income. 21 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response 67 Limitation of limited partners’ tax losses – guarantees provided by associated persons The definition of “guaranteed amounts” in section HD 11(7) should be extended to include guarantees provided by persons associated with the partner on the limited partner’s behalf. PwC (page 18), Deloitte (page 6), NZICA (page 7), NZICA (page 34) Agree in part. It should be clarified that the definition of “guaranteed amounts” should be the lesser of the share of partnership debt of the partner (or any person associated with the partner), and the market value of any assets held by the partner (or a person associated with the partner) that are available to satisfy the debt. 68 Limitation of limited partners’ losses Loss limitation rules should only apply to limited partners. Deloitte (page 6), Corporate Taxpayers Group (page 7) Agree. If the section OB 1 definition of “partner” is amended to include general partners, the HD 11 loss limitation rules will extend to include general partners. It should be clarified that HD 11 only applies to limited partners. 69 Limitation of limited partners’ tax losses – definition of “distribution” The definition of “distribution” in proposed section HD 11(4) should exclude the market value of withdrawals to the partner from the partnership. PwC (page 18) Disagree. The remo val of proposed section GD 16 will ensure that transac tions between partners and the partnership will not be deemed to be at market value. 70 Limitation of limited partners’ losses The application of section CD 33(11) when calculating capital gains amounts should be clarified in relation to limited partners. Kensington Swan (page 4) Disagree. Officials consider that the provisions as currently drafted work appropriately. 71 Limitation of limited partners’ losses The reference to HD 12 in section HD 11(1) should be omitted as section HD 11 can never apply to a deduction allowed under section HD 12. NZICA (page 32) Disagree. Section HD 11 will apply to deductions denied by section HD 11 and then allowed by section HD 12 (see section HD 12(3)). 72 Limitation of limited partners’ losses If a limited partner becomes a general partner the person should be able to deduct any additional amounts that the person incurs. NZICA (page 33) Agree. However, a general partner that switches back to being a limited partner within 60 days of the end of the income year should be treated as a limited partner for the purposes of section HD 11 to prevent circumvention of the rules. 22 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response 73 Limitation of limited partners’ losses Section HD 11(4)(a) should include an option to include unrealised increases in the market value of the partner’s interest in the partnership as “investments”. NZICA (page 33) Disagree. This rule would be difficult to administer as the value of unrealised amounts is inherently subjective. 74 Limitation of limited partners’ losses Section HD 11(4)(b)(i) the words “the market value of withdrawals to the partner” should be changed to something along the lines of “the market value of any withdrawals from the partnership by a partner”. This would aid understanding. NZICA (page 33) Disagree. Official s consider that the current wording is sufficiently clear. 75 Limitation of limited partners’ losses The guarantee that basis is received for should be the greater (not the lesser) of the partner’s partnership debts or the market value of the property against which the guarantee may be enforced NZICA (page 33) Disagree. The submitter’s proposal, if implemented, could result in partners receiving basis for amounts that they are not at risk for. 76 Limitation of limited partners’ losses The definition of distribution in section HD 11(4)(b)(i) is confusing and should be redrafted as “the value at the time of distribution of any amounts distributed to the partner from the limited partnership.” NZICA (pages 33-34) This is a drafting issue that has been noted. 23 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response 77 Technical amendments to proposed section HD 11 • That subsection (4)(b)(i) should refer to distributions rather than withdrawals; • That subsection (4)(b)(iii) should exclude payments of interest; • That subsection (4)(c)(i) should include current year income; • That subsection (4)(c)(ii) should say “if the partner were treated as a company”; • That subsection (4)(d)(iii) is not clear and should be re-examined; • That the term “partner’s associate” in subsection (7) does not appear to be used anywhere. New Zealand Law Society (page 11), NZVIF (page 28) This is a drafting issue that has been noted. Agree. Officials consider th at subsection (4)(a)(iii) should be amended along similar lines. Agree. This is a drafting issue that has been noted. This is a drafting issue that has been noted. Agree. See response to submission on guarantees provided by associates 78 Technical amendments to proposed section HD 11 Section HD 11(4)(b)(iii) should be removed. Amounts received from financial arrangements are income and already included in HD 11(3) NZICA (page 32) Agree. See above. 79 Technical amendments to proposed section HD 11 The definition of the term “withdrawal” in section HD 11(7) should be modified to ensure it does not apply to amounts that are already included as income. NZICA (page 32) Disagree. Clause 116, HD 12 80 Section HD 12 – loss limitation carry forward rules That the proposed entitlement to a deduction in section HD 12 be modified to a right to carry forward. NZICA (page 34) Disagree. Officials consider that the provision as currently drafted is sufficiently clear. 24 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response Transitions to limited partnerships – clause 118, subpart HZ 81 Special partnerships and overseas limited partnerships becoming limited partnerships Existing special partnerships or overseas limited partnerships should be allowed to use the accounting book value of their interest in the partnership when transitioning into the new limited partnership rules. PwC (page 19), SKYCITY (page 2) Agree. Clause 119, OB 1 82 Income tax treatment of general partners General partners of limited partnerships should be included in the definition of “partner”. PwC (page 5), Deloitte (page 4), New Zealand Law Society, Corporate Taxpayers Group (page 4), SKYCITY (page 2) Agree. General partners of certain “overseas limited partnerships” can make equity contributions to the partnership. Therefore, it is necessary for New Zealand’s flow through limited partnership rules to apply to general partners of these partnerships. 83 Definition of “partner’s interests” The proposed definition of partner’s interests is circular, and should be clarified. KPMG (page 5) Disagree. Officials consider that the provision as currently drafted operates appropriately. 84 Definition of “partnership share” Further guidance needs to be provided for how a “partnership share” is to be determined, particularly where partners enter and exit the partnership during the year. PwC (page 8), Minter Ellison Rudd Watts (page 2), NZICA (page 14) Agree. The proposed definition of “partnership share” has been drafted to accommodate situations where a partner has a different share in one type of property (e.g. income) than another (e.g. partnership assets). Officials will consider whether the provision can be made any clearer, and further clarification can be provided in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin . 25 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response 85 Joint ventures and co-ownership – application of Inland Revenue Acts The phrase “for the purposes of this Act” in paragraph (c) of the defin ition of “partnership” should be amended to “for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts”. PwC (page 20) Agree. This would provide consistency with paragraph (b) of the definit ion of “partnership”. 86 Treatment of foreign limited partnerships that do not have a general partner The definition of “foreign corporate limited partnership” should be amended to clarify whether it includes foreign limited liability partnerships that have separate legal status but do not have a general partner. Deloitte (page 6), Corporate Taxpayers Group (page 7) Agree. The definition of foreign corporate limited partnership in clause 119 should be amended so that it applies whether or not the limited partnership has a general partner. Clause 121, OE 4 87 When is income sourced in New Zealand? The proposed source rule in OE 4(1A) should be amended so that income is apportioned appropriately between resident and non-resident partners. Deloitte (page 8), NZICA (page 9) Disagree. Officials cons ider that such an amendment would add unnecessary complexity. Administrative matters 88 Income and expenditure of co-trustees Proposed amendments to section HD 1 of the ITA and section 42 will mean co-trustees will no longer be able to file a joint return. Amendments should be made to section HH 4 and proposed section 42 to ensure co-trustees can still make joint returns. PwC (page 23), NZICA (pages 11, 36) Disagree. The definition of trustee already includes co-trustees. 89 Overseas limited partnerships with no New Zealand presence It should be made explicit that only the New Zealand resident partners of overseas limited partnerships need to file tax returns, and a provision should be inserted in the Bill to make it clear that when a partnership has no New Zealand presence there is no filing requirement by the partnership Corporate Taxpayers Group (page 7) Disagree. Officials consider that the draft legislation already achieves this. 26 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response 90 Partnership filing requirements The current IR 7 and IR 7P forms should be reviewed to ensure that the information contained in those forms is consistent with the information required to be disclosed under section 42 of the TAA. PwC (page 24), NZICA (page 11) Noted. 91 Section HK 17 – general partners and absentees In the case of a general partner of a limited partnership, the general partner should determine the absentee’s liability as if the general partner is fulfilling the absentee limited partner’s tax obligations. NZICA (page 35) Disagree. Officials co nsider that the legislation is already clear on this point. Other matters 92 Limited partnerships and listing agreements Limited partnerships that are party to a listing agreement should be companies for tax purposes. Officials’ submission Agree. MED are recommending that limited partnerships be allowed to list, as this does not pose regulatory concerns . However, from a tax perspective, listed limited partnerships cannot be administered as flow-thr ough entities. This is because the tax rules for entering a partnership require knowledge of the exiting partner’s tax liability. This information is virtually impossible to obtain where partnership interests are bought and sold through a secondary market. This recommended treatment is consistent with the current provisions in the bill for overseas limited partnerships, which are companies for tax purposes if they are listed. 93 Re-write of the Income Tax Act 2004 Any changes in relation to the tax rules for partnerships will also need to be reflected in the Income Tax Bill 2006. PwC (page 25) Noted. 27 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response 94 Application of the GST Act 1985 to limited partnerships The legislation should provide clarity as to whether a limited partnership will be treated as a company or unincorporated body for GST purposes PwC (page 26) Disagree. It is su fficiently clear that a limited partnership will be treated as a company for GST purposes. 95 Partners and partnerships that have different balance dates Partners should include in their income year all partnership income from partnerships that have the same income year. Deloitte (page 9), Corporate Taxpayers Group (page 8) Noted. This is a current issue and there is insufficient time to consider whether the recommended solution is appropriate in all cases. 96 Tax deductibility of interest for partnerships An amendment is required to ensure that interest incurred by a partnership is tax deductible even if it is on a loan taken out to make distributions of current year profits Deloitte (page 9) Noted. This is a current issue and there is insufficient time to consider whether the recommended solution is appropriate. 97 Associated persons The associated persons rules should not apply to limited partnerships, particularly where these limited partnerships have five or fewer persons NZICA (page 8) Noted. The associated persons rules are currently the subject of a review, with any future tax changes likely to be proposed in future tax bill. 98 Associated persons That the application of the associated persons rules to the new partnership provisions require further consideration NZICA (page 9) See above. 99 Non-resident partners and fixed establishments Clarify whether non-resident limited partner has fixed establishment in NZ due to membership of the partnership NZICA (page 10) Disagree. The po licy intention of the limited partnership rules is to provide flow-through treatment and limited liability to limited partners. The review is not intended to change the rules on whether non-resident limited partners are taxable on income attributable to a permanent establishment in New Zealand. Whether or not a non-resident has a permanent establishment in New Zealand will depend on the facts of individual cases. 28 Number Issue Submission Subm itter Officials’ response 100 Treatment of New Zealand limited partnerships in foreign jurisdictions Clause 10 of the bill should be clarified to make it clear that separate legal personality does not affect the tax treatment of limited partnerships in overseas jurisdictions. NZVIF (page 9) Disagree. The ta xation of limited partnerships in other countries depends on the laws of those other countries, which New Zealand’s domestic law cannot influence. In certain situations two countries can treat fo r tax purposes limited partnerships differently depending on, among other things, their interpretation of a double tax agreement. Countries can potentially resolve their differences in interpretation through bilateral discussions using the mutual agreement procedure in double tax agreements. 101 Treatment of New Zealand limited partnerships in foreign jurisdictions The treatment of New Zealand limited partnerships in foreign jurisdictions should be addressed in future. NZVCA (page 4), NZVIF See above. 102 Special tax provisions for Maori businesses The bill requires special tax provisions for domestic capital investment into Maori businesses. Te Ratonga Ture Disagree. This is outside the scope of the bill. 29 PART C ANNEX Loss attributing qualifying companies and limited partnerships Loss attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs) have some qualities that are similar to the proposed limited partnership vehicle. Both entities can flow through income, gains and losses to their owners (respectively, shareholders and limited partners), while providing them with limited liability. Unlike proposed limited partnerships, LAQCs must be small, closely held companies. They cannot have more than five shareholders. There is no restriction on the number of limited partners in a limited partnership. LAQCs are often used in forestry investments. Forestry investments incur expenses over a number of years, but may only earn income at the end of the investment’s life. A disadvantage of investing in forestry through a normal company is that deductions cannot be used by the shareholders until the end of the investment, when income is earned. Investing through an LAQC means that the losses flow through to investors, so that they can use the investment’s losses against their other income in the year that they are incurred. The discussion document on tax treatment of partnerships that was issued in 2006 asked for submissions on whether it is necessary to retain LAQCs, given the introduction of new limited partnership rules. Submitters argued that LAQCs would still be needed, as limited partnerships are not fully substitutable for LAQCs. Different regulatory requirements apply to LAQCs and limited partnerships – for example, LAQCs need only one investor, whereas limited partnerships require a general partner and a limited partner. There are also some differences in tax treatment – for example, investors can exit an LAQC without triggering tax consequences, whereas there will generally be tax consequences for limited partners upon exit if their profit is over $50,000. Further, there would be transactional costs for existing LAQCs if they were required to become limited partnerships. No final decisions were made, but the issue of whether LAQCs are still needed will be the subject of a future review. It should be noted that the contents of the Limited Partnerships Bill will not affect the LAQC rules.
Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill (No. 2) Officials’ Report to the Education and Science Committee on Submissions on the Bill February 2007 Prepared by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department and the Ministry of Education CONTENTS Overview 1 Policy changes 2 Three-year repayment holiday 3 Repayment obligations for borrowers not on a repayment holiday 9 Extending the amnesty on student loan penalties 14 Interest-free loans for borrowers studying full-time overseas at undergraduate level 18 Information matching between Inland Revenue and Customs 20 Late payment penalty rate 21 Hardship relief 22 Removal of interest write-offs for borrowers ineligible for interest-free loans 23 Interest write-offs incorrectly given 24 Technical amendments 25 Charging interest on late payment penalties 26 Advising of absence from New Zealand 27 Applications in writing 28 Application of care and management 29 Need for new Part 3 30 Overdue amounts of less than $250 31 Small balance threshold 32 Other issues raised by submitters 33 Differentiating between borrowers who are overseas and those in New Zealand 34 Interest-free loans for borrowers working overseas for a charitable organisation 35 Interest 36 Causes of permanent long-term departures from New Zealand 37 Ability to grant borrowers an exemption to the 183-day interest-free loans requirement 38 Access to funding for nursing education 39 Effect of student loans 40 Role of Inland Revenue 41 Student loan scheme 42 Separate agency for student loans 43 1 OVERVIEW The Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill (No.2) amends the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992. The changes in the bill deal with concerns that the current rules for overseas borrowers are discouraging many from meeting their repayment obligations and may deter some borrowers from returning home. The bill aims to reduce the current barriers to borrowers who are living overseas from returning to New Zealand. To achieve this, a number of changes are being introduced. The amnesty on student loan penalties is being extended, giving overseas borrowers in arrears the chance of a fresh start. In addition, a three-year repayment holiday is being introduced for overseas-based borrowers. This change recognises New Zealanders’ tradition of OE, which can confer certain benefits on New Zealand when borrowers return with new skills. Interest will continue to be charged during a repayment holiday. For overseas-based borrowers not on a repayment holiday, repayment obligations will be simplified and will be based on the size of their loan balance. Because interest-free loans are generally limited to borrowers living in New Zealand there is an increased financial incentive for borrowers to leave New Zealand without informing Inland Revenue. To ensure that borrowers receive their correct entitlements under the Student Loan Scheme Act, the bill introduces an information match between the New Zealand Customs Service and Inland Revenue. Other changes in the bill include giving the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the ability to grant borrowers studying full-time overseas an interest-free loan, reducing the late-payment penalty rate and making the hardship provisions more flexible. Fifteen submissions were received on the bill and were generally in favour of the amendments. 2 Policy Changes 3 THREE-YEAR REPAYMENT HOLIDAY Clauses 9 and 35 Submissions (1 – New Zealand Medical Students’ Association, 2 – Association of University Staff of New Zealand, 4 – New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations, 8 – Association of Staff in Tertiary Education, 9 – NZEI Te Riu Roa, 10 – C Browne, 12 – New Zealand Nurses Organisation, 13 – New Zealand Council of Trade Unions) The amendments that establish a three-year repayment holiday for borrowers based overseas should proceed. The amendments are supported because: • The repayment holiday will be of benefit to all graduates by preventing the accumulation of penalties while they are overseas. It removes a disincentive for graduates to return to New Zealand, while at the same time creating an incentive to return after three years. (New Zealand Medical Students’ Association ) • The repayment holiday is another important step in ensuring that student loan borrowers have the same opportunities as previous generations to travel and work without being tied to student loan obligations. (Association of University Staff of New Zealand) • Any interim measure that reduces difficult and unfair repayment obligations for borrowers is worth supporting. Tertiary education students/graduates should be provided with every opportunity to explore the world upon graduation or during a break in their studies, and be provided with the same sorts of experiences that previous generations enjoyed – working and travelling without having harsh student loan repayment obligations. (New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) • It is a matter of fairness to ensure that current and future generations of young New Zealanders have opportunities for “the big OE” without having to fear returning or indeed having to decide never to do so. (Association of Staff in Tertiary Education, NZEI Te Riu Roa, New Zealand Nurses Organisation, New Zealand Council of Trade Unions) • Young New Zealanders are always going to want to travel overseas. Overseas travel and experience serves to enrich and enhance the skills brought back to New Zealand. (C Browne) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Submission (5 – Business NZ) 4 • The amendments that establish a three-year repayment holiday for borrowers based overseas should not proceed: • The establishment of a repayment holiday could create incentives for borrowers to leave the country. • The concept of a repayment holiday raises fundamental questions of fairness: why should borrowers who have left the country effectively be rewarded, when those who stay in New Zealand meet their repayment obligations and make an economic contribution to the country are not? • The effective removal of any requirement by non-resident borrowers to keep repaying their loans for three years would seem to undermine incentives for personal financial prudence and responsibility. Comment Officials do not consider that introducing a repayment holiday for overseas-based borrowers will create incentives for borrowers to leave the country. Research conducted by the Ministry of Education has shown that borrowers’ decisions to leave New Zealand are generally independent from the fact that they have a student loan. In addition, overseas-based borrowers are not eligible for the full interest write-off which gives effect to interest-free loans. Interest-free loans for New Zealand-based borrowers create incentives for borrowers to remain in New Zealand. In relation to the issue of fairness, the benefit of interest-free loans recognises the contribution to society and the economy made by those living in New Zealand. Furthermore, borrowers who make repayments on their loan (whether compulsory or not) are reducing the size of their loan balance. Borrowers who are overseas and choose not to make repayments will have their loan balance increase because debt escalation is the result of compounding interest. Hardship provisions are available so that borrowers in New Zealand can lower their repayment obligation, including to nil, if payment would cause them serious financial hardship. Inland Revenue will continue to encourage voluntary repayments from borrowers who are on a repayment holiday, and is looking at ways to make it easier for borrowers living overseas to make repayments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (15 – National Council of Women of New Zealand) The introduction of a repayment holiday has met with mixed views from NCWNZ members. On the one hand, some members are wary of giving more discretionary powers to the Commissioner while others see the possibility of a more compassionate approach when it comes to female students and graduates or even males who become parents. 5 Comment It should be noted that all overseas-based borrowers are entitled to a repayment holiday. There is no discretion for the Commissioner to grant a repayment holiday to certain overseas-based borrowers and not others. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (15 – National Council of Women of New Zealand) Another National Council of Women of New Zealand member wondered what the holiday implied in terms of female students who stayed in New Zealand, because their contribution could potentially be as valuable as that of an overseas-based borrower. Some members expressed the view that the repayment holiday should be available for borrowers living in New Zealand. One member suggested giving the Commissioner the ability to grant a repayment holiday for the first three years of the life of a borrower’s child. Comment New Zealand-based borrowers’ repayment obligations are income-contingent which protects borrowers with little or no income. Furthermore, hardship provisions mean that a borrower’s repayment obligation can be negotiated, including to nil, if payment would cause serious hardship. As noted previously, interest-free loans for New Zealand-based borrowers recognises the contribution made by such borrowers to New Zealand’s society and economy. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (4 – New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) Supports the repayment holiday being able to be taken in one or more periods. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 6 Submission (4 – New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) Borrowers should be able to apply to the Commissioner to extend their repayment holiday beyond three years – for example to five years, if they intend to live and/or work overseas for more than three years. Comment The three-year repayment holiday is intended to allow borrowers to go overseas short- term without their loans increasing at a punitive rate. The suggestion would, in effect, allow for a five-year repayment holiday for all borrowers overseas, meaning that those borrowers overseas long-term would not have any repayment obligations for a significant period of time. The policy was designed to recognise the traditional “OE”, which typically lasts less than five years. Officials consider that entitlement to a repayment holiday should be automatic. Requiring borrowers to apply to the Commissioner for a repayment holiday increases administration and compliance costs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (4 – New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) All overseas borrowers should be entitled to a repayment holiday from 1 April 2007. Those who are already overseas, having been there for one, two, three or more years should not be penalised from being provided with the opportunity to take a three-year repayment holiday. There should be some recognition for those borrowers relative to the harsh and unaffordable repayment rules they have had to experience. Comment It should be noted that all borrowers are entitled to a three-year repayment holiday in their lifetime. However, transitional rules mean that certain borrowers who are overseas-based as at 1 April 2007 would need to first become New Zealand-based before going overseas again to be able to use their repayment holiday or to use the full three-year period. There is a trade-off between simplicity and equity in setting the rules for borrowers already overseas. The simple option would be for all borrowers who are overseas- based after 1 April 2007 to be automatically entitled to a three-year repayment holiday from that date. However, it could be argued that it is inequitable for borrowers who have been non-compliant and who do not avail themselves of the fresh start provided by the amnesty to be immediately entitled to the full three-year period. Officials consider that the transitional rules provide an equitable solution. Borrowers who have been compliant (or who comply with the amnesty terms) are immediately 7 entitled to the full three-year repayment holiday. Borrowers who have been non- compliant and who do not come within the amnesty are entitled to a repayment holiday based on the period of time they have been overseas. If such a borrower becomes New Zealand based they will be entitled to the remainder of the three-year period the next time they go overseas. It is a reasonable expectation that such borrowers will have become compliant again, generally through having repayment deductions from salary or wages. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (3 – New Zealand Law Society) The provisions that provide for a borrower’s entitlement to the three-year repayment holiday, and in particular the way the amnesty eligibility ties in with that entitlement, are unnecessarily complex. Comment Officials agree that the provisions are complex. This complexity arises because of the trade-off between simplicity and equity (and consequently the drafting of the provisions is complex). The rules are straightforward for all borrowers who become overseas-based after 1 April 2007. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (14 – B and K Holland) The repayment holiday should include past years. Comment Borrowers who come within the amnesty and meet its terms will have no penalties applied to their accounts. Instead, compounding interest will apply in its place. This gives the same result as if the repayment holiday included past years. If the repayment holiday was automatically retrospective for all borrowers who have failed to meet their obligations, in effect this would be an automatic amnesty. Officials consider that for borrowers to reap the amnesty benefits they should be required to demonstrate a willingness to repay their loan. This is why borrowers who come within the amnesty must make repayments over a two-year period to have no penalties applied to their accounts. 8 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (14 – B and K Holland) The Committee should ensure that clauses of this nature are not designed to continue the “indentured” nature of the student loan contract. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 9 REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR BORROWERS NOT ON A REPAYMENT HOLIDAY Clause 9 Submissions (3 – New Zealand Law Society, 4 – New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) Why should there be a different approach to repayment obligations between overseas- based and New Zealand-based borrowers? Should income-based assessments for all overseas-based borrowers be preferred to loan balance-based assessments? (New Zealand Law Society) Repayment obligations for overseas-based borrowers should be income-contingent. Calculating a repayment obligation based on the size of the borrower’s loan is not a fair way to determine repayment obligations. Such a regime will severely penalise borrowers who may have large loans yet low-to-medium incomes while overseas. (New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) Comment An income-contingent approach would be administratively complex and potentially difficult for borrowers to understand their obligations. Borrowers overseas would be required to self-assess their income and their repayment obligations would be calculated accordingly. This in itself causes problems because borrowers who are non-resident for tax purposes currently have no requirement to declare their overseas-sourced income. Furthermore, Inland Revenue would have no way of verifying whether the income declared was correct – double tax agreements which provide for the exchange of information do not apply for student loans purposes. This means that the intent of an income-contingent-based system for overseas based borrowers could potentially be undermined. An additional problem with an income-contingent repayment approach for overseas- based borrowers is determining the level at which to set the repayment threshold. Currently, borrowers in New Zealand are required to make payments when their income exceeds $17,160 per year. For a borrower living in London, this threshold is relatively low given the cost of living there. On the other hand, for a borrower living in Vietnam, the threshold is relatively high. England has recently introduced an income-contingent system for overseas borrowers whereby the repayment threshold is calculated by reference to the price level index of the borrower’s country of residence. There are seven different price level index bands (meaning that there are seven different repayment thresholds), with the index being calculated using comparative price level indices produced by the Statistical Office for the European Communities or the World Bank. Officials consider that introducing a similar system in New Zealand would be administratively complex and difficult for borrowers to understand. The three-year repayment holiday should mean that the majority of borrowers will be in a position where they are earning enough income so they can meet the required 10 repayments when the holiday ends. Hardship provisions will, however, continue to exist so that borrowers overseas can renegotiate their repayment obligations with the Commissioner if payment would cause serious hardship. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Submission (3 – New Zealand Law Society) There are two instances where a borrower may find the different repayment obligations for New Zealand-based borrowers and overseas-based borrowers problematic: • where a borrower is intending to be overseas-based for a period beyond the repayment holiday period and they will be earning little or no income. In such cases the borrower will be subject to repayment obligations greater than those if they had remained in New Zealand and earned a similar amount; and • borrowers who travel overseas for a period of time that takes them out of the 183-day residence rule will be required, for the period they are in breach of the rule, to modify their repayments. For example, a borrower who travels away from New Zealand for more than 31 days (but perhaps not much more) will be in breach of the 31-day rule and forced to amend their repayments. Comment Overseas-based borrowers earning little or no income Inland Revenue will have the ability to reduce an overseas-based borrower’s repayment obligation, including to nil, if payment would cause serious hardship. This should mitigate concern that the different repayment obligations for New Zealand- based and overseas-based borrowers are unfair. Borrowers who travel overseas for periods that take them outside the 183-day residence rule Once borrowers have qualified for the full interest write-off which gives effect to interest-free loans (generally by being present in New Zealand for 183 or more consecutive days) they will continue to be eligible for the write-off until they have been overseas for 184 consecutive days or more. If a period that would have been 184 or more consecutive days is broken by a period or periods in the aggregate of 31 days or less in New Zealand, the time spent in New Zealand will be treated as having been spent overseas. This is to stop borrowers coming back to New Zealand for very short periods in order to continue receiving the interest write-off. The effect is that borrowers will become subject to the repayment rules for overseas- based borrowers only if they spend more than six months out of New Zealand (including a period or periods in aggregate of 31 days in New Zealand during that six- 11 month period). Officials do not consider this to be onerous. Borrowers who leave the country for short periods will continue to be subject to the rules for New Zealand- based borrowers. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (2 – Association of University Staff of New Zealand) Introducing progressive repayment rules for overseas borrowers will help make the student loan scheme fairer and less punitive for borrowers. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (11 – I Johnston) Requiring people to repay their student loan at a rate of one-fifteenth of the loan balance plus interest is prohibitive to people making a good life for themselves. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (10 – C Browne) If this bill is not passed, the submitter considers the repayments required on her student loan would be crippling. This would put the submitter in a weak position to contribute to the economy upon return to New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (5 – Business NZ) 12 Further thought should be given to the need for, and nature of new repayment obligations for non-resident borrowers. The benefits to borrowers of the new repayment obligations vary considerably (and are seemingly arbitrary), depending on the level of an individual’s debt. If there is a need to reduce the annual repayment obligations for all non-resident borrowers, another option would be to reduce the proportion of the principal that borrowers are required to pay – for example, to one-twentieth or one twenty-fifth. This would ease repayment burdens, while distributing the benefits fairly across all borrowers. Comment Non-resident repayment obligations were initially designed so that loans would be repaid in a maximum of 15 years. This was achieved by requiring quarterly payments of a fixed amount of the principal (based on the loan balance at the beginning of the tax year following the year of departure), plus the estimated interest for the year. If the loan balance was less than $15,000, $1,000 of the principal was required each year. For loans over $15,000, principal of 1/15 th of the loan balance was required. For many borrowers the amount that they are expected to pay is simply not achievable. For example, a non-resident borrower with a loan balance of $60,000 will have a repayment obligation in the first year following departure from New Zealand of nearly $8,000. A resident borrower would need to have income of nearly $100,000 to have the same liability. Because the existing non-resident repayment regime is unaffordable for many, officials consider that there is a need to reduce the annual repayment obligations for overseas-based borrowers. Officials agree that the proposed repayment obligations have potential inequities around the steps. With a $15,000 loan balance, the repayment obligation is 7% of the principal. With a loan balance of $15,001, the repayment obligation is 13% of the principal. These inequities must be considered against the benefits of having repayment obligations which will be simpler for borrowers to understand. Officials consider that any repayment obligation which includes the estimated interest on a borrower’s loan balance for the year will be difficult for borrowers to understand. On balance, officials consider that the simplicity of the proposed amendments outweighs the inequities that exist around the proposed steps. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (14 – B and K Holland) The existing repayment obligations that appear to be assigned to borrowers living overseas, in the submitter’s personal case, appear to not be agreed to in the student loan contract and therefore appear to be unlawful. The submitter also notes that the 13 1992 student loan contract provides that borrowers will not be charged interest if their income does not reach a threshold in any given year. Comment Section 63 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 provides that the Act supplements the provisions of the student loan contract and prevails in the event of any inconsistency. The existing repayment obligations and interest write-off provisions for borrowers living overseas are therefore lawful. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (14 – B and K Holland) Compliance is low because the system places no duty of care on agencies that are primarily benefiting from the monies earned and because there is no real communication from government agencies. Comment Inland Revenue is currently looking at what steps it could take to make it easier for overseas based borrowers to make repayments (including ways to make communication with borrowers simpler and easier). Recommendation That the submission be noted. 14 EXTENDING THE AMNESTY ON STUDENT LOAN PENALTIES Clauses 4, 19, 30 and 35 Submissions (2 – Association of University Staff of New Zealand, 4 – New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations, 8 – Association of Staff in Tertiary Education, 9 – NZEI Te Riu Roa, 12 – New Zealand Nurses Organisation, 13 – New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, 14 – B and K Holland) Support the extension of the amnesty on student loan penalties from 31 March 2007 to 31 March 2008: • News of the changes to student loan interest and repayment obligations could take a long time to reach many overseas-based borrowers and an extra year of the amnesty would help to ensure that borrowers are not penalised. (Association of University Staff of New Zealand) • The amnesty should be provided because the existing repayment obligations for borrowers living overseas are unaffordable for many. (New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) • Time is needed for borrowers who are overseas to become aware of the amnesty and thus avoid being unwittingly penalised. (Association of Staff in Tertiary Education, NZEI Te Riu Roa, New Zealand Nurses Organisation, New Zealand Council of Trade Unions) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Submission (3 – New Zealand Law Society) The Law Society is surprised to see that a default penalty of 5% of the borrower’s outstanding loan balance is deemed to apply where a borrower fails to apply for, or qualify for, the amnesty. Provisions allow for the penalty to be reduced in line with any actual repayment penalty for the given period, but such a reduction is not mandatory. The provision should be viewed closely by the Committee to ensure that cannot lead to discrepancies in the treatment of borrowers who fall within this proposed section. Comment The intention is that the penalty added to borrowers’ accounts would be the lesser of 5% of the borrower’s loan balance or the penalties that would have been charged under the existing rules. 15 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (14 – B and K Holland) The amnesty should be extended probably far beyond April 2008 and its end date should be linked to an accountability report by Inland Revenue that shows the majority of loan holders have been notified of the extension. Notification should be attempted by sending the information to the permanent addresses that exist on the front page of all loan contracts. Comment The purpose of the amnesty is to give borrowers a “one-off” opportunity to have a fresh start. If the amnesty on penalties was extended well beyond 31 March 2008, by its very nature it would no longer be an amnesty and would effectively constitute a policy shift. Officials consider that it is not feasible to show that the majority of loan holders have been notified of the extension; Inland Revenue does not have valid contact details for many borrowers eligible to come within the amnesty. In addition, Inland Revenue does not generally hold copies of loan contracts and, even if it did, it is likely that the address details would no longer be valid in many cases. Inland Revenue is planning an advertising campaign to inform borrowers about the amnesty. In particular, this campaign will target borrowers’ friends and family living in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (14 – B and K Holland) The Committee should recognise that little or no public notification was given to borrowers about the existing amnesty. Comment Formal advertising of the existing amnesty was deferred because of the policy changes in the bill. Inland Revenue is planning a formal communications campaign based on the terms of the extended amnesty. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 16 Submission (14 – B and K Holland) Penalties should never have been imposed on loans, including on younger members of society who have not been adequately counselled on the financial ramifications of signing a student loan contract. Comment If penalties were not imposed when borrowers failed to meet their repayment obligations, borrowers would simply not repay their loans. For the system to work, it is vital that those who do not comply with the rules are seen to face the consequences. StudyLink, the service of the Ministry of Social Development responsible for student loan applications, suggests that student loan applicants get independent advice and think about the financial implications before taking out a student loan. The documents produced for borrowers suggest the need to budget/calculate what needs to be borrowed and how this will be repaid. Since 1999 applicants under 18 generally need a parent or guardian to sign the student loan contract giving their consent before a loan application is accepted. Officials consider it reasonable to expect that the parent or guardian will have exercised some care and responsibility in explaining the implications to the applicant of what they are signing up to. Recently, StudyLink has undertaken a pilot programme whereby they engage with students to try and make sure that the key messages around the financial implications of taking out a student loan are understood, including where they can get advice and assistance to make good decisions about their study and how they will fund it. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (14 – B and K Holland) The amnesty should include the writing-off of interest and penalties of borrowers living overseas who are willing to take the cut in pay, increase their cost of living, and return to New Zealand to offer their skills and inspiration to the homeland. Comment If borrowers who came within the amnesty had both interest and penalties written off then non-compliant borrowers would be better off than compliant non-resident and resident borrowers. In addition, there would be a significant fiscal cost to do this. 17 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (14 – B and K Holland) Encourage Inland Revenue to be informed of the amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (14 – B and K Holland) A clause in writing should state that if an amnesty is entered into, that no law in the future can repeal the interest write-offs that have been given. In addition, it should be recognised that often younger members of society do depend on the government and do expect that it is looking out for the best interest of its citizens. There should be a guarantee that those who have entered into the amnesty will not be bounced back and forth if and when a new government is elected. Comment Under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty Parliament must always be free to legislate for the public good. This means that one parliament cannot bind another. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 18 INTEREST-FREE LOANS FOR BORROWERS STUDYING FULL- TIME OVERSEAS AT UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL Clause 14 Submissions (2 – Association of University Staff of New Zealand, 8 – Association of Staff in Tertiary Education, 9 – NZEI Te Riu Roa, 12 – New Zealand Nurses Organisation, 13 – New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, 14 – B and K Holland) The new power granted to the Commissioner to grant borrowers studying full-time overseas at undergraduate level an interest-free loan is supported. The new power recognises the benefit to New Zealand of students who live and study in overseas countries. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Submission (14 – B and K Holland) The exemption is too limited. It sets forth the precedent that university education is more important than anything else and should be rewarded. There are many crafts, including arts, music, cultural and environmental activities which can be deeply enhanced by time overseas in communities which have already flourished. Thus, those borrowers who are willing to sacrifice time in their homeland to gain experience in other fields should not be valued less than those at university. The application of this study rule appears to be the continuation of the class system. Comment One rationale for the exemption is to build research connections and support study where there is little or no provision in New Zealand. If the exemption were extended further, it would be difficult for the government to have confidence in the quality of study undertaken overseas. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submissions (4 – New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations, 12 – New Zealand Nurses Organisation) 19 The submission supports the amendment so that student loans are available to people studying at overseas tertiary institutions. (New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) The submission supports the provision of accessing funds for study in undergraduate education opportunities overseas. (New Zealand Nurses Organisation) Comment The bill gives the Commissioner the ability to grant borrowers studying overseas an interest-free loan. It should be noted that this change does not mean that borrowers can take out a loan for study that is undertaken overseas. Rather, it means that any existing loan they had before leaving New Zealand will be interest-free while they are studying. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Submission (8 – Association of Staff in Tertiary Education) The exemption should also be available to those undertaking post-graduate study. Comment The exemption is already available to those undertaking full-time post-graduate study overseas. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 20 INFORMATION MATCHING BETWEEN INLAND REVENUE AND CUSTOMS Clauses 28, 36, 38 and 39 Submissions (3 – New Zealand Law Society, 5 – Business NZ, 14 – B and K Holland, 15 – National Council of Women of New Zealand) The proposed information match between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) is supported. However, the Law Society is concerned about access to the record of a borrower’s travel. B and K Holland make the comment that the information match should not be used to “catch” people. The National Council of Women of New Zealand made the comment that the information match plus increased administration costs were seen as reasons for reassessing the value of the student loan scheme. Comment The information match between Inland Revenue and Customs will not create any additional information for Customs. The movement of borrowers to and from New Zealand will be recorded in Inland Revenue’s computer system to track the periods for which borrowers are entitled to an interest-free loan (the main purpose of the match being to determine entitlement to interest-free loans). Processes will be put in place to ensure that only those staff members of Customs and Inland Revenue that require access to the information can obtain it. Inland Revenue is also considering the period for which historical information needs to be retained. The National Council of Women of New Zealand’s comments on reassessing the value of the student loan scheme are outside the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 21 LATE PAYMENT PENALTY RATE Clause 17 Submissions (2 – Association of University Staff of New Zealand, 4 – New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations, 14 – B and K Holland) The reduction in the penalty rate which applies to overdue payments is supported. B and K Holland claims he did not receive notice of the amounts due. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Submission (5 – Business NZ) The submission opposes the reduction in the penalty rate which applies to overdue payments, and considers that instead the focus should be on ensuring that borrowers are made aware that they may be entitled to hardship relief. Comment Once a borrower’s repayment obligation becomes overdue it is subject to a compounding penalty which is equal to 26.82% a year. This has the effect of doubling the amount overdue every three years. While some borrowers in arrears will be entitled to hardship relief this is not necessarily the case. Officials consider that setting the late payment rate roughly equal to the rate which applies to many credit cards strikes the correct balance between providing a disincentive to clear other debt before student loan payments and a punitive penalty rate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 22 HARDSHIP RELIEF Clause 23 Submissions (4 – New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations, 8 – Association of Staff in Tertiary Education, 9 – NZEI Te Riu Roa, 12 – New Zealand Nurses Organisation, 13 – New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, 14 – B and K Holland) The changes being made are supported. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Submission (14 – B and K Holland) The Committee should look into the hardship of those borrowers who return home. The submitter claims that because he had not completed a university course he was not entitled to $10,000 being offered by the government to help people return home. Comment Provisions are available so that repayment obligations can be negotiated, including to nil, if payment would cause serious hardship. The submission in relation to the $10,000 government funding is beyond the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 23 REMOVAL OF INTEREST WRITE-OFFS FOR BORROWERS INELIGIBLE FOR INTEREST-FREE LOANS Clauses 16 and 23 Submission (14 – B and K Holland) The provisions which repeal the interest write-offs for borrowers ineligible for interest-free loans should be looked into. It appears government agencies are using tactics to bounce borrowers back and forth and yet there is no duty of care to give borrowers options. Comment The interest write-offs that existed prior to interest-free loans being introduced are being abolished because they are inconsistent with the policy intent of interest-free loans, which is to encourage borrowers to remain in, or return to, New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 24 INTEREST WRITE-OFFS INCORRECTLY GIVEN Clause 33 Submission (14 – B and K Holland) The clause in which interest write-offs are not required to be reversed in cases where borrowers have repaid their loans is supported. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (14 – B and K Holland) Borrowers overseas should be given the opportunity to make a full and complete repayment of their loan balances without interest during the amnesty period. If not, it could be construed that inner channels allowed some people who were notified that they could pay off their loans without interest while those people who had not sought out nor been provided with any amnesty information would be penalised while having to continue with interest. The submitter claims that Inland Revenue has added interest without notification and Inland Revenue says that they cannot write-off interest. Comment Inland Revenue did not inform any borrowers that they could pay off their loans without interest. Allowing overseas borrowers to pay off their loans balances without interest would mean that these borrowers would be better off than compliant resident borrowers who have paid interest in past years. In addition, there would be a significant fiscal cost to do this. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 25 Technical Amendments 26 CHARGING INTEREST ON LATE PAYMENT PENALTIES Clause 18 Submissions (1 – New Zealand Medical Students’ Association, 4 – New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations, 14 – B and K Holland) The amendment which ensures that interest cannot be charged on an amount which has become overdue and thus subject to late payment penalties is supported. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 27 ADVISING OF ABSENCE FROM NEW ZEALAND Clause 10 Submissions (2 – Association of University Staff of New Zealand, 4 – New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations, 14 – B and K Holland) The amendments extending the length of time by which borrowers can be overseas without informing Inland Revenue from three months to six months is supported. This differentiates longer holidays from more permanent changes in living circumstances and will simplify matters for borrowers. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Submission (14 – B and K Holland) The submission notes that in their personal case Inland Revenue did not follow through with sending assessments and their loan went out of control. Inland Revenue should ensure that where a permanent address was listed on the loan contract of the mother, Inland Revenue should attempt to notify borrowers of assessments and changes. Comment As noted earlier, Inland Revenue does not generally hold copies of loan contracts and, even if it did, it is likely that the address details would no longer be valid in many cases. There are also privacy issues associated with sending borrowers’ details to a person other than the borrower without specific consent. Inland Revenue already has a process in place whereby borrowers can nominate another person to act on their behalf. Inland Revenue sends assessments annually where a valid address is held. In addition, statements of the borrower’s account are sent twice a year. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 28 APPLICATIONS IN WRITING Clauses 21 and 23 Submission (1 – New Zealand Medical Students’ Association) The submission supports the amendment which removes the requirement that applications for relief from penalties must be made in writing in all circumstances. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (3 – New Zealand Law Society) Allowing applications for relief from penalties or having to meet a repayment obligation on hardship grounds to be made by telephone may mean that there is insufficient evidence to support the decision the Commissioner reaches. Comment The amendment is intended to streamline applications for relief if Inland Revenue already holds evidence to support an application made by a borrower. For example, most borrowers are salary and wage earners and Inland Revenue receives income details from employers on a monthly basis. If there is any doubt about the information which a borrower is supplying by telephone, a written request may still be required. Inland Revenue also records all telephone calls made to one of its call centres. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 29 APPLICATION OF CARE AND MANAGEMENT Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Tax Administration Act and the Student Loan Scheme Act should be amended to allow the Commissioner to correct interest and to apply the care and management provisions to correct student loan balances which are wrong as a result of administrative error. Comment It has been Inland Revenue’s position that care and management applies to the Student Loan Scheme Act. In the past Inland Revenue has used care and management to ensure that miscalculated loan balances, due to administrative errors, do not result in borrowers having to suffer the consequences of those errors. Practically, this means that interest that has been over-charged as a result of error has been refunded but under-charged interest has been written off. However, a review of the care and management provisions has concluded that there is uncertainty as to its application. The scope of the care and management provisions, as it applies to student loans is limited to repayment obligations and does not encompass interest. Another issue identified as part of this work is that there is a provision which, on a literal interpretation, may prevent the Commissioner issuing an amended statement of re-calculated interested. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 30 NEED FOR NEW PART 3 Clause 9 Submission (15 – National Council of Women of New Zealand) The Council appreciates the need for the new Part 3 of the bill as being less cumbersome than inserting a myriad of deletions and amendments for previous clauses. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 31 OVERDUE AMOUNTS OF LESS THAN $250 Clause 22 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The amount of arrears which Inland Revenue may refrain from collecting should be increased from $250 to $333. Comment With the reduction in the penalty rate from 2.0 to 1.5%, the amount which does not incur any late-payment penalty increases to $333. It is uneconomical to pursue such small amounts. Any amount which Inland Revenue refrains from collecting will not be written off but will be payable in a future year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 32 SMALL BALANCE THRESHOLD Clause 20 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The small balance threshold for borrowers’ end-of-year repayment obligations and employer repayment deductions should be increased from $5 to $20 only for debit amounts. Comment Inland Revenue currently refunds income tax which is overpaid by more than $5 or and write-off amounts underpaid of $20 or less. It would be inconsistent to have a higher overpaid student loan amount that is not refunded. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 33 Other issues raised by submitters 34 DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN BORROWERS WHO ARE OVERSEAS AND THOSE IN NEW ZEALAND Submission (14 – B and K Holland) The Committee should recognise that a fundamental unfairness exists to “re- categorise” loan borrowers simply because they move overseas. A burden of financial duty is placed on them which is not applied to Kiwis living in the country. Comment Interest-free loans are available only to borrowers living in New Zealand. Therefore, there is a need to distinguish between New Zealand-based and overseas-based borrowers. As noted earlier, there are also reasons why officials consider it necessary to have different repayment obligations for New Zealand-based and overseas-based borrowers. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 35 INTEREST-FREE LOANS FOR BORROWERS WORKING OVERSEAS FOR A CHARITABLE ORGANISATION Submission (1 – New Zealand Medical Students’ Association) Interest-free loans for graduates undertaking work overseas for charitable organisations is supported. Comment The Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to grant borrowers a full interest write-off (which gives effect to interest-free loans) if they are working as a volunteer or for token payment for a charitable organisation named in regulations to the Act. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 36 INTEREST Submissions (4 – New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations, 6 – K Hays, 7 – L Clarke, 14 – B and K Holland) The concept of interest should be completely removed from the Student Loan Scheme. (New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations) Students who incurred a student loan in the 1990s should have their interest reduced. Their loans have grown so large that they have despaired of ever repaying the loan and many have left the country. (K Hays) The interest rate should be reduced. Repayment of the principal amount, plus a 1% administration fee and perhaps even an inflation contribution would make the target of repayment far more achievable for borrowers. (L Clarke) The Committee should recognise an interest rate should be set which is not higher than commercial bank rates and is only a small figure designed to encourage loan seekers to be “advantaged by a student loan”. (B and K Holland) Comment Since April 2006, borrowers living in New Zealand are eligible for interest-free loans (including borrowers who took out their loans in the 1990s). Generally, only those borrowers who are living overseas for more than six months are ineligible for an interest-free loan. The policy intention of interest-free student loans was to encourage borrowers to remain in, or return to, New Zealand and to contribute to New Zealand’s society and economy. Completely removing interest or reducing the interest rate for borrowers living overseas would be inconsistent with this aim and would have a potentially significant fiscal cost. The interest rate is set on an annual basis and is the average of the 10-year bond rate plus a small margin to cover administration costs. The interest rate for the current tax year is 6.9 percent. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 37 CAUSES OF PERMANENT LONG-TERM DEPARTURES FROM NEW ZEALAND Submission (5 – Business NZ) More work should be done to understand the key causes of permanent long-term departures from New Zealand and the points at which the government can or should intervene. Comment Officials agree that it is not clear whether, or to what extent, student loans are a factor in borrowers going overseas. Work to understand the causes of permanent long-term departures is beyond the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 38 ABILITY TO GRANT BORROWERS AN EXEMPTION TO THE 183- DAY INTEREST-FREE LOANS REQUIREMENT Submission (15 – National Council of Women of New Zealand) The submission supports the Commissioner being able to grant borrowers living overseas an exemption to the 183-day requirement in certain circumstances, meaning that such borrowers will be eligible for an interest-free loan. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 39 ACCESS TO FUNDING FOR NURSING EDUCATION Submissions (12 – New Zealand Nurses Organisation) The student loan criteria for length of courses eligible for a student loan should include return-to-nursing programmes. The Committee should look at amendments that would make it possible for “Return to Practice” vocational short courses to be eligible for student loans. Future initiatives for nurses and midwives to access student loans or allowances are needed as New Zealand is competing internationally to retain nursing graduates for the health workforce in New Zealand. Comment The Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 deals with the repayment of student loans, not eligibility criteria for obtaining a student loan or student allowances. The submissions are therefore beyond the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 40 EFFECT OF STUDENT LOANS Submissions (14 – B and K Holland) The Committee should: • realise that amendments of the nature of those in the bill have been written by elite members of the law using a language that is designed to not only exclude, but to preclude any ability for the average citizen to understand. The Committee will therefore not be offering help for the masses of people who have been swallowed by the student loan scheme, but instead will push them further away from being able to take any personal responsibility for their financial status with the government; • note the submitter’s personal case as an example of how the loan scheme did not educate or inform the borrower about how the debt could get out of hand; • seek better language for loan contracts and any amendments put into action with examples of what can occur with loan and debt build up; • seek better loan policies so that younger, inexperienced people are not disadvantaged by loan agreements and legal and governmental jargon, thus signing away their futures. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 41 ROLE OF INLAND REVENUE Submission (14 – B and K Holland) Although the submitter had a permanent address of their mother listed on the student loan contract pages Inland Revenue failed in its duty to provide the submitter with thorough information before taking out the loan and failed in its contractual agreement to send assessments. As a result, the debt contracted for has multiplied exponentially and instead of helping the submitter’s chances to get ahead as intended, the student loan scheme has hindered the submitter’s capacity to do so. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 42 STUDENT LOAN SCHEME Submission (14 – B and K Holland) The Committee should call into action public policy so that the marginalised and impoverished strata of society is not “funding” the government through this “investment scheme” called the Student Loan Scheme of 1992 and all amendments made to that scheme. Comment The submission is beyond the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 43 SEPARATE AGENCY FOR STUDENT LOANS Submission (14 – B and K Holland) The Committee should recommend that a separate distinct agency be set up to operate, facilitate, administer and keep track of all past, present and future student loan contracts. Comment The submission is beyond the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined.
Page 1 21 December 2007 Special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue The new KiwiSaver legislation This report will form the basis of an article to appear in the Tax Information Bulletin. The legislation giving effect to compulsory employer contributions and the employer tax credit is contained in the Taxation (KiwiSaver) Act 2007, which received Royal assent on 19 December 2007, and will apply from 1 April 2008. The new Act also includes a number of other amendments. The most significant, discussed in this special report, are changes to the member tax credit, the establishment of a process to deal with invalid KiwiSaver enrolments, changes to the definition of “salary and wages”, changes to complying fund rules, and regulatory regime changes. BACKGROUND The government announced in Budget 2007 a number of changes to KiwiSaver that significantly increase the incentives to join and to continue making regular contributions. The key changes are: • A tax credit to members that matches their contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme, or a complying superannuation fund, up to a maximum of $20 per week. The legislation giving effect to the member tax credit was enacted in May, in the Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Act 2007, and applies to contributions made from 1 July 2007. • A compulsory employer contribution when an employee contributes to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund that will be phased in over four years, starting at 1 percent from 1 April 2008, reaching 4 percent of gross salary or wages from 1 April 2011. This has been legislated for in the Taxation (KiwiSaver) Act 2007. • An employer tax credit which will reimburse employers for contributions they will be required to make into their employees’ KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund up to a maximum of $20 a week for each employee. This has also been legislated for in the Taxation (KiwiSaver) Act 2007. Page 2 KEY FEATURES The new rules for KiwiSaver and complying funds involve changes to the KiwiSaver Act 2006, Income Tax Act 2004, Tax Administration Act 1994, Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 and the KiwiSaver Regulations 2006. The main changes are: • New rules for the member tax credit, the main changes being: 1. The period of membership for the purposes of calculating the member tax credit is clarified, and a definition of “creditable membership” is introduced. 2. Contributions received by the Commissioner but not transferred to a provider in the member credit year will count towards the calculation of the credit, and a definition for “member credit contributions” is introduced. 3. The formula for calculating the amount of credit is simplified. • Rules to establish compulsory employer contributions. • Rules to establish the employer tax credit. • Rules for dealing with “invalid KiwiSaver enrolments”. • Amendments to the definition of “salary or wages”. • New rules for minimum employee contributions. • A number of changes have been made to the regulatory regime: 1. The definition of “independent trustee” is amended to remove the requirement that the trustee be independent from the administration and investment managers of the scheme. 2. An amendment has been made to section 206 of the KiwiSaver Act to provide that persons are not investment brokers if they merely exercise a function, duty or power under the KiwiSaver Act. 3. A new section has been introduced to require all KiwiSaver schemes and complying superannuation funds to disclose their approach to responsible investment. 4. A new section provides transitional relief for KiwiSaver and complying superannuation fund providers for any non-compliance with any Act until 31 January 2007. • A number of changes have been made with respect to complying superannuation funds: 1. The definition of complying fund rules has been amended. 2. Compulsory employer contributions to complying superannuation funds must be allocated to the investment profile chosen by members and be fully vested. 3. The Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 has been amended to enable schemes that provide insurance benefits that are linked to superannuation accumulation to reduce those insurance benefits if members elect to transfer their complying superannuation fund accumulation to a KiwiSaver scheme. 4. To obtain complying superannuation fund status, a registered superannuation scheme will have to satisfy the requirements for the scheme to be registered before 1 July 2007. Page 3 A number of other changes have also been made and will be described in a Tax Information Bulletin to be published in 2008. DETAILED ANALYSIS Member tax credit (sections KJ to KJ 5 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections MK1 to MK8 of the Income Tax Act 2007) A number of changes have been made to the member tax credit rules as enacted by the Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Act 2007. Section references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise specified. Creditable membership The requirements that a person must meet to be eligible for the member tax credit are set out in section KJ 2. New section KJ 2(a) introduces the requirement of having a “creditable membership” of KiwiSaver or a complying fund. Accordingly, a new definition of “creditable membership” has been included in section OB1. The definition provides that when a person joins KiwiSaver or a complying fund, the period of eligibility for the member tax credit begins from the earlier of: • the first of the month in which contributions are deducted from an employee’s salary or wages; or • the first of the month in which a contribution is received by Inland Revenue (a voluntary contribution paid directly to Inland Revenue); or • the first of the month in which securities are allotted by a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund. Contributions paid to Inland Revenue – transitional rule A transitional rule applies as a result of the legislative requirement that all contributions must be paid to Inland Revenue during the period 1 July to 30 September 2007. This transitional rule treats membership as beginning on the first of the month in which a provider receives a valid application for membership from a person if contributions are received by either Inland Revenue or the provider during the period 1 July to 31 October 2007. Amount of member tax credit The amount of the member tax credit payable is calculated under the formula in section KJ 3. It has been amended to correct a drafting error and to clarify the calculation of the credit. If a person meets the requirement set out in section KJ 2 for the full member credit year (1 July to 30 June), the amount of the credit is the total amount of contributions received during the year up to a maximum of $1042.86. If the person does not met the requirements in section KJ 2, the credit is apportioned on the basis of the number of days the person meets the requirements. Two possible formulas for calculating the credit are provided, with the relevant formula depending on whether the amount contributed by the member is more or less than 1042.86 ÷ 365 (2.857 per day). Page 4 First formula: member credit contributions 1 included days 2 Second formula: $1042.86 x included days 365 If the amount calculated by the first formula is less than 1042.86 ÷ 365 (2.857 per day) the amount of the member tax credit is equal to the total amount of that person’s contributions for the member credit year (1 July to 30 June). If the amount calculated under the first formula is equal to or greater than 1042.86 ÷ 365 (2.857 per day) the amount is calculated by the second formula. Example 1 Tracey is automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver on 15 April 2008 through her employer. Her eligibility for the member tax credit begins on 1 April (deductions made from salary or wages in April), 91 days before the end of the member credit year (30 June 2008). Tracey makes contributions to her KiwiSaver scheme during this 91-day period totalling $500 (approximately $38.00 a week). As the amount that she has contributed is greater than 1042.86 ÷ 365 (2.857), the amount of her member tax credit is calculated using the formula: $1042.86 x 91 (included days) 365 Tracey’s tax credit entitlement for the 2007/08 member credit year is $260.00 (13 weeks at $20.00). Example 2 Mike opts into KiwiSaver through his employer on 26 April 2008. The first contributions from his pay will not be deducted until May, so he makes a voluntary contribution to Inland Revenue that is received on 28 April 2008. Mike’s eligibility for the member tax credit begins on 1 April 2008, 91 days before the end of the member credit year (30 June 2008). Mike makes contributions to his KiwiSaver scheme during this 91-day period totalling $200 (approximately $15.38 a week). As the amount he has contributed is less than 1042.86 ÷ 365 (2.857), the amount of his member tax credit for the 2007/2008 member credit year is equal to the total amount of his member credit contributions for the member credit year = $200.00 (approximately $15.38 x 13 weeks). 1 “Member credit contributions” are the total amount of a person’s member credit contributions for all of the person’s complying superannuation funds and KiwiSaver schemes for the member credit year. 2 Included days are the number of days in the member credit year on which the person meets the requirements in section KJ 2. Page 5 Member credit contributions A new definition of “member credit contributions” is introduced and includes amounts received and held by the Commissioner. These are contributions received and held by Inland Revenue but not on-paid to the provider until after the member credit year. These will count as contributions for calculating the member tax credit for that year. Employer contributions, amounts diverted under a mortgage diversion and amounts refunded are excluded for the purposes of calculating the credit. Processing claim for credit Section KJ 4(2) has been amended to provide that upon receipt of a claim, Inland Revenue has 30 working days to process and pay the claim to the provider. Member tax credits are paid to providers on a first-come basis. There is no longer a pro-rating of the payment between providers if the member has more than one provider. Payment of credit New subsection KJ 4(3) provides the circumstances in which the Commissioner may make a payment to individual members or to another provider. A final payment may be made to the member or the member’s estate for reasons of serious illness, death or when the member’s account is closed. Inland Revenue will pay the credit to the member’s provider at the time the claim is made. If there is, or will be, a change in provider (a request for transfer), the credit will be paid to the new provider if requested by the first provider. Allocating the credit Section KJ 5 (3) has been amended to clarify the rules in relation to allocating the member tax credit. The provider must allocate the member tax credit according to the current investment allocation instructions the member has elected or the investment allocation to which the member has been allocated. Claiming the credit The provider must claim the tax credit in the “form prescribed by the Commissioner”. Providers will make a claim after 30 June each member credit year on the basis of the contribution information they hold (and Inland Revenue does not hold) at that date. That will include information such as the amount of contributions received directly by the provider and the amount of contribution subject to a mortgage diversion. Inland Revenue will calculate and pay the credit based on the information received and the contribution information it holds. All contributions for complying funds will, however, need to be received by 30 June to count towards the calculation of the credit in that year as all complying fund contributions are made directly from the employer to the provider. (Inland Revenue does not hold information for complying funds.) Page 6 The actual process for claiming the member tax credit is still being developed by Inland Revenue and providers. It will require providers to furnish necessary information to Inland Revenue to enable it to calculate the member tax credit. Inland Revenue will calculate the member tax credit on the basis of such information and will make supplementary member tax credit payments, where appropriate, when additional information is available in relation to money in the holding account. Providers retain the ability to make supplementary claims for periods for which they have obtained the information needed to make a claim – either when no claim was previously lodged, or when less than the maximum eligible claim has previously been paid. However, because Inland Revenue will be calculating the entitlement to the member tax credit based on information provided to it and also on the qualifying contributions it holds, KiwiSaver providers may not need to make supplementary claims after the end of the member credit year. As complying superannuation fund providers may not always hold the relevant IRD numbers for their members, an amendment enables complying superannuation funds that do not have a member’s IRD number to supply other information to Inland Revenue to assist it in making the payment. If it is unable to make the payment on the basis of the information provided, Inland Revenue will inform the provider so that the provider can write to the member requesting the necessary information. Section 68C (3)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to clarify that the IRD number need be provided only if known. Transfers – information to be provided Section 56 of the KiwiSaver Act has been amended so that KiwiSaver providers are no longer required to provide information about the amount of the member tax credit received or information about previous claims made by them to a new KiwiSaver provider on transfer. This is because Inland Revenue will hold this information. However, the following details will still need to be provided to another scheme on transfer: • the value of qualifying contributions received directly; • mortgage diversion arrangements; • any periods of ineligibility owing to residence outside New Zealand; and • the date on which a person first became a member of a KiwiSaver scheme. Permanent emigration Clause 14(2) of Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act has been amended to provide that when KiwiSaver members permanently emigrate and transfer all of their funds in their KiwiSaver scheme to a foreign superannuation scheme the nominal value of the credit up to the value of their accumulation in the scheme will be repaid to the Crown. Page 7 Compulsory employer contributions New Subpart 3A of Part 3 of the KiwiSaver Act (sections 101A to 101K) requires an employer to make an employer contribution for each employee who has deductions for KiwiSaver or complying superannuation fund 3 contributions from his or her gross salary or wages. This requirement will be phased in as follows: From Employer compulsory contribution rate as a percentage of gross salary or wages 1 April 2008 1% 1 April 2009 2% 1 April 2010 3% 1 April 2011 4% The introduction of compulsory employer contributions will increase the incentive for employees to contribute to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund by having contributions deducted from their salary or wages. Existing contributions will count towards the compulsory amount in certain circumstances to prevent employers already making employer contributions to existing registered superannuation schemes from having to make additional compulsory employer contributions. New section 101B provides rules relating to who should bear the cost of the compulsory employer contributions. In the first instance, compulsory employer contributions will be paid in addition to the employee’s gross salary or wages as an additional payment (benefit) on top of existing remuneration. However, from 13 December 2007, employers and employees (or unions) may agree as to how compulsory employer contributions will be funded, provided that agreement is an outcome of good faith bargaining. General rules for compulsory employer contributions New section 101A requires employers to pay a compulsory employer contribution for employees if they meet the requirements set out in section 101C (employee requirements). 4 The requirements are that employees are: • paid salary or wages from which the employer deducts, or is required to deduct, contributions for their KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund; 3 A complying superannuation fund is a section within a registered superannuation scheme that has been approved by the Government Actuary as having met certain criteria, such as KiwiSaver lock-in rules and portability. 4 An employer contribution is an employer superannuation contribution (specified superannuation contribution) made by an employer to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund and includes compulsory contributions. It does not include amounts, such as group life insurance, that do not count as a contribution under section 68(2) of the KiwiSaver Act. See the definition of “employer contribution” in section 4 of the KiwiSaver Act. (Note that for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007, the term “employer’s superannuation contribution” replaces the term “specified superannuation contribution”.) Page 8 • aged 18 and over; • not entitled to withdraw an amount from their KiwiSaver scheme or complying fund under the scheme rules that require lock-in (that is, the age of eligibility for New Zealand superannuation or five years of membership, whichever occurs later); and • not a defined benefit scheme member. If an employee does not meet any of these requirements, the employer is not required to make a compulsory employer contribution for that employee. This does not prevent an employer making voluntary contributions to an employee’s KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund if the employee does not meet these requirements. Employers are required to make compulsory contributions if they are required to make KiwiSaver deductions from an employee’s salary or wages. For example, if an employee is subject to the automatic enrolment rules but the employer does not make a deduction of KiwiSaver contributions, the employer is still required to pay a compulsory employer contribution for that employee. A defined benefit scheme member (defined in section 4 of the KiwiSaver Act) is an employee whose employer makes contributions to an existing registered superannuation scheme that is a defined benefit scheme. (The retirement benefits for employees are calculated by reference to their salary or wages.) Compulsory employer contributions are not payable for members of defined benefit schemes if: • the scheme was registered before 17 May 2007; • the employer provided access to eligible employees before 17 May 2007; and • the employee was employed by the employer before 1 April 2008 and the employer makes or has agreed to make contributions before that date. In addition, an employee will be treated as a defined benefit scheme member in the following circumstances (provided that the foregoing requirements are met): • The scheme is one that succeeds the scheme that has to be registered by 17 May 2007, provided that all relevant members transferred to that scheme by virtue of section 9BAA of the Superannuation Schemes Act. • If an employee is covered by a collective agreement in force before 17 May 2007 and expiring after 1 April 2008 that requires the employer to make contributions to that scheme. • If the employee has changed employment and the new employer is required to make contributions to that scheme on the same basis as the previous employer. This would cover the situation where an employee is treated as a defined benefit scheme member but changes employment and the new employer is required to continue to contribute to that scheme for that employee. Page 9 Calculation of compulsory employer contribution New section 101D sets out the rules for determining the amount of the employer contribution. The amount of the contribution payable by an employer is calculated using the following formula: Payment of salary or wages multiplied by CEC rate – other contributions – hybrid scheme contributions The “payment of salary or wages” is the amount of gross salary or wages from which the employer deducts or required to deduct an employee’s contribution to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund. The “CEC rate” is: • 1% if the payment of gross salary or wages is made for a pay period in the year starting on 1 April 2008; • 2% if the payment of gross salary or wages is made for a pay period in the year starting on 1 April 2009; • 3% if the payment of gross salary or wages is made for a pay period in the year starting on 1 April 2010; • 4% if the payment of gross salary or wages is made for a pay period in the year starting on or after 1 April 2011. The CEC rate for a year applies only if the whole pay period is in the year specified. For example, if a pay period for an employee spans 1 April 2009, then the 1 percent rate will apply for the employer contributions in respect of the payment of salary or wages for that pay period. The 2 percent rate will apply to the next pay period. “Other contributions” is the total amount that an employer pays (or credits) an employee in relation to payment of gross salary or wages if the amount is: (a) an employer contribution made in absence of this section (that is, voluntary contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund): (b) an employer superannuation contribution made to a registered superannuation scheme if: • the scheme (or the prior scheme if the scheme is a successor scheme) was registered before 17 May 2007; 5 • the scheme provides access to eligible employees before 17 May 2007; • the employee is employed by the employer before 1 April 2008 and the employer makes or has agreed to make employer contributions before that date, or the employee is covered by a collective agreement that is in force before 17 May 2007 and expires after 1 April 2008 requiring employer contributions to the registered superannuation scheme; and 5 In relation to a successor scheme, all the relevant members have to be transferred by virtue of section 9BAA of the Superannuation Schemes Act. Page 10 • the registered superannuation scheme provides that the contributions vest in the employee within five years of becoming a member. 6 (c) an employer contribution in relation to an employee who is a member of Parliament, a judicial officer, or a sworn member of the police or a class of employee prescribed in regulations made under section 230A of the KiwiSaver Act. “Hybrid scheme contributions” cover those contributions an employer makes to a scheme where the retirements benefits are calculated by adding to employee’s total contributions a percentage of those contributions. Such schemes are not included in the “defined benefit scheme member” exclusion or in “other contribution”. The amount of the contribution is given by the following formula: Member’s contributions (the amount of the employee’s contributions for the period to which the payment of gross salary or wages relates) multiplied by the vesting percentage (the percentage of the employee’s total contributions to be added to those contributions five years after the employee first became a member of the scheme). Employer contributions that are paid from reserves will be treated as employer contributions for the purposes of “other contributions”. Also, the amount of the employer contribution will be the amount payable before the deduction of employer’s superannuation contribution tax (specified superannuation withholding tax). 7 Example 3 Joe is member of his employer’s existing superannuation scheme and joins KiwiSaver. Joe, the scheme and his employer meet the rules of “other contributions” in section 101D of the KiwiSaver Act. Joe’s employer makes a matching 2% employer contribution to the existing scheme every pay period. His employer will not be required to make compulsory employer contributions in the 2008/09 tax year or 2009/10 tax year as the amount of “other contribution” equals or is greater than the amount of the compulsory employer contribution payable. However, from 1 April 2010 Joe’s employer will be required to make a 1% compulsory employer contribution to his KiwiSaver scheme and a 2% contribution from 1 April 2011 as the contributions to the existing scheme are less the compulsory amount. Section 101E allows an employee and employer to agree the allocation of compulsory employer contributions between an employee’s KiwiSaver Scheme and complying superannuation fund. If no agreement is reached, the compulsory employer contributions are first allocated to the employee’s KiwiSaver scheme and then to the complying superannuation fund (if any). 6 To determine the amount of the contribution that vests within the five-year period when a contribution is paid, the employer is required to calculate, on the basis of the vesting scale in the trust deed, the amount that will vest if the employee is still a member after five years. It is not necessary to adjust amount calculated if the contribution does not actually vest. 7 Employer’s superannuation contribution tax from 1 April 2007. Page 11 Application of section 101B Section 101B(1) provides that compulsory contributions 8 are to be paid in addition to an employee’s gross salary or wages used in section 101D(3) (on top of remuneration). Subsections (2) and (3) provide that a contractual arrangement of parties to an employment relationship cannot defeat the intention of subsection (1). That is, if the contractual arrangements specify that the employee must pay the cost of compulsory employer contributions from the employee’s existing salary or wages, the arrangement has no effect. However, on or after 13 December 2007, parties to an employment relationship are free to agree contractual terms and conditions that ignore the “on top of” remuneration requirement and the provisions of this section do not apply. Subsection (4) inserts an avoidance of doubt provision so that the duty of good faith as described in the Employment Relations Act 2000 always applies when parties to an employment relationship bargain for terms and conditions relating to compulsory contributions and associated matters, such as the employer tax credit. Enforcement of the payment of compulsory employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme Sections 93 and 101F(1) require employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme to be paid to Inland Revenue at the same time as employee contributions via the PAYE system. Other amounts that do not count as contributions under section 68(2) of the KiwiSaver Act (such as group life insurance) must be paid direct to the provider. The payment of compulsory employer contributions via Inland Revenue provides a mechanism to allow Inland Revenue to police the payment by employers. Non-payment of compulsory employer contributions will be subject to current collection and enforcement practices. Section 216 of the KiwiSaver Act has been amended to provide a specific penalty for employers that do not comply with the requirement to pay compulsory employer contributions. From 1 April 2009, section 216 will be repealed and employers will be subject to the penalties that apply for the non-compliance of other PAYE-type tax obligations. Furthermore, the definition of tax in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be amended from 1 April 2008 to include compulsory employer contributions. This will allow the Commissioner to use existing collection powers. Enforcement of the payment of compulsory employer contributions to complying superannuation funds Section 101F(2) requires compulsory employer contributions to a complying superannuation fund to be paid direct to the provider. The payment must be made no later than one month after the payment of the salary or wages to which the contribution relates. 8 A compulsory contribution is an amount of compulsory employer contribution calculated by section 101D ignoring the application of section 101D(5)(d). Page 12 In keeping with current practice, it will be the responsibility of the provider to ensure compulsory employer contributions from an employer are made. It is expected that the current practice of employers certifying that all employer contributions have been made will continue. New section 101H requires a provider to give notice to an employer requesting payment if the provider is aware that the employer has failed to pay compulsory employer contributions. A copy of that notice must be provided to the Government Actuary. If payment does not occur within one month of the notice being given and the amount of the unpaid contributions is more than $500, the provider must give notice to the Government Actuary of the default. New Section 101I specifies that once notification has been received, the Government Actuary must determine the amount of any short payment. The Government Actuary can use existing powers under the KiwiSaver Act to investigate the matter and determine the amount outstanding. Once the Government Actuary has determined the amount of any short payment, the employer will be notified of the amount and will have 28 days to pay or dispute the amount. If the amount remains unpaid and no objection has been received, the amount will be transferred to Inland Revenue for collection. The amount will be due and payable to the Commissioner 20 working days after the notice is received. The definition of “tax” in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is amended to include compulsory employer contributions to a complying superannuation fund. This will allow the Commissioner to impose penalties and use existing collection powers from 1 April 2009 when such debts are referred to the Commissioner for collection. Rules for providers Section 101G requires the provider to allocate the compulsory employer contributions across the investment products that the member has subscribed to or been allocated. Such contributions are to vest immediately. In addition, section 101G(3) requires the provider to notify Inland Revenue the date that a member will be entitled to withdraw his or her accumulated interest in the scheme. This must be done within two months of the person becoming entitled to withdraw the accumulated interest. Inland Revenue must notify the member’s employer of that date so that the employer can cease making compulsory employer contributions. Withdrawal of compulsory employer contributions The KiwiSaver Act allows a member to withdraw employer contributions that have vested in an employee in the following circumstances: • to assist with the purchase of the member’s first home (which includes second chance buyers) 9 ; • for significant financial hardship; • for serious illness; 9 A second chance buyer is a previous home owner who is in the same financial situation as first-home buyers in terms of income and assets. Second chance home buyers will apply to Housing New Zealand for a determination of whether they are in the same financial situation as a first-home buyer. Page 13 • on permanent emigration from New Zealand; • on the death of the member; • as required by any statute such as an order made under section 31 of the Property(relationships) Act 1976; and • upon the age of eligibility of New Zealand superannuation of five years of membership, whichever is the later. As section 101G(2) provides that compulsory employer contributions will vest immediately in the member, such contributions will be able to be withdrawn in the foregoing circumstances. The KiwiSaver Act prevents employer contributions being diverted under a mortgage diversion facility, and this applies for compulsory employer contributions. Shareholder-employees of a close company Employers of shareholder-employees of a close company will be required to make compulsory employer contributions for them if their remuneration from the company is subject to PAYE and they are having KiwiSaver contributions deducted from that remuneration. Salary or wages for the purposes of the KiwiSaver Act excludes salary or wages or other income to which section OB 2(2) (meaning of source deduction payment: shareholder-employees of close companies) applies and, as a result, only salary or wages subject to PAYE will give rise to a compulsory employer contribution. Private domestic workers The KiwiSaver Act has been amended to clarify how KiwiSaver applies to private domestic workers, who are required to pay their own PAYE. As a result, private domestic workers can be both an employee and employer under the KiwiSaver Act, and the Act has been clarified to reflect this. Private domestic workers can deduct KiwiSaver contributions from their salary or wages and can choose to be an employer for the purposes of compulsory employer contributions. If they pay compulsory employer contributions, they will be entitled to the employer tax credit. Employer contributions counting towards the employee contribution rate The KiwiSaver Act allowed employer contributions to count towards the employee contribution if the parties agreed. With the advent of compulsory employer contributions, this provision was to be amended from 1 April 2008 to require a minimum employee contribution of 4% unless the transitional rates in proposed section 66A applied (limited to employees who had already entered into such an agreement). The Finance and Expenditure Committee recommended that the transitional rule be extended to all employees if their employer agreed to contribute at the 4% contribution rate. New section 66A allows employees to enter into an agreement with their employers that the employer will contribute at least 2% towards the employee’s 4% minimum contribution rate, from 1 April 2008 until 31 March 2011, if: Page 14 • the employer and employee agree that they will use the transitional rates of contribution; • the employer contribution for the payment of salary or wages is equal to or greater than the relevant transitional rate for the employee; and • the employer contribution vests in the employee immediately after it is made. The minimum contribution rate for employees whose employer agrees to contribute towards their contribution rate will be: Pay period Minimum employee contribution Minimum employer contribution Total contribution From 1 April 2008 2 percent 2 percent 4 percent From 1 April 2009 2 percent 2 percent 4 percent From 1 April 2010 3 percent 3 percent 6 percent From 1 April 2011 onwards 4 percent 4 percent 8 percent Employer tax credit (sections KJ6 to KJ10 of the Income Tax Act 2004) New section MK 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (section KJ 6 of the Income Tax Act 2004) provides a tax credit to employers to help offset the costs of making matching compulsory employer contributions to an employee’s KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund. The tax credit will be equal to the lesser of the employer’s contribution or $20 a week for each employee. Sections MK 9 to MK 16 of the 2007 Act (sections KJ 7 to KJ 12 of the 2004 Act) set out the eligibility rules and how the credit is to be applied. To minimise compliance costs and cash-flow implications of compulsory employer contributions, the payment of the tax credit is integrated into the PAYE remittance process. It is expected that employers will pay Inland Revenue a net amount after deducting the tax credit from their PAYE liability for the payment period. (Section references are to the 2007 Act unless otherwise specified.) This tax credit can be claimed by any employer (including tax-exempt entities such as charities) provided the employer is making an employer contribution to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund for an employee who meets the requirements in section MK 9. The employer tax credit applies to employer contributions made to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund from 1 April 2008. Entitlement New section MK 1(2) allows an employer who makes a contribution on behalf of an employee a tax credit for the payment period equal to the amount calculated under section MK 10. To be eligible for the credit the employer must met the requirements in section MK 9. Page 15 Eligibility requirements To be eligible for the employer tax credit, the employer must: (a) pay an employer contribution in respect of an employee who is aged 18 or over and is not entitled to withdraw an amount from a KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund under the scheme rules that require lock-in (that is, the age eligibility for New Zealand superannuation or five years of membership, whichever occurs later); (b) provide details of the amount of the credit in an employer monthly schedule or remittance certificate (although that is not required if subsection (2) applies); and (c) be an employer to which KiwiSaver applies (that is, be a employer who is tax- resident in New Zealand or, if not tax-resident, be an employer who carries on a business from a fixed establishment in New Zealand or chooses to apply the KiwiSaver Act on behalf of employees). Subsection (2) applies when the employer has unpaid compulsory employer contributions. Amount of credit The amount of the tax credit allowable to an employer is equal to the lesser of: • the amount of the employer contributions for the employee for the payment period; and • the amount calculated using the formula – $20 multiplied by weeks in payment period. “Weeks in payment period” means the number of weeks for the payment of the employee’s salary or wages for which the employee meets the eligibility requirements in paragraph (a) above, including weeks in that period in which no employer contribution is made. Parts of a week are expressed as a decimal. A “payment period” means that period in which PAYE is withheld in relation to an employee and includes a period of a month or a period of 1 st to the 15 th of a month and a period from the 16 th to the end of a month. For example, if during a payment period for the month of April an employer makes employer contributions of $50, the amount of the tax credit will be $50 because the actual employer contributions are less than the amount calculated by the formula ($85.71). If the actual employer contributions were more than $85.71, the amount of the tax credit for that month would be limited to $85.71. The tax credit is available in respect of both voluntary and compulsory employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund. Page 16 Application of tax credit New sections MK 11 to MK 13 set out the rules relating to how the tax credit will be applied. The tax credit is integrated into the PAYE remittance process so that the value of the credit is given to employers at the same time as the employer is required to remit the contributions to providers or Inland Revenue. Section MK 11 provides that the tax credit arises when the PAYE is due for the month or the date of payment of PAYE for a private domestic worker in which the employer contributions were made. For example, tax credits for contributions made during April 2008 for a monthly payment period would arise on 20 May 2008, being the payment date for that period. Subsection (2) deals with the situation when subsection MK 9(2) applies, which covers short payment of compulsory employer contributions to a complying superannuation fund or a KiwiSaver scheme. Sections MK 12 and MK 13 deal with the use of the tax credits to offset employer contributions and other PAYE liabilities. The tax credit calculated for a payment period is used as follows: • first, to pay KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions due for that period or amount owing to a complying superannuation fund referred to in a notice received by the Commissioner under section 101I(5) of the KiwiSaver Act; • second, to pay voluntary KiwiSaver employer contributions for that payment period; • third, to pay any other amounts payable for that payment period by the employer; • fourth, to pay any other amount payable by the employer to the Commissioner (arrears of an amount due under an Inland Revenue Act); and • fifth, refunded to the employer. From 1 April 2009, new section 101I of the KiwiSaver Act requires the Government Actuary to send a notice to Inland Revenue detailing the amount of compulsory employer contributions to a complying superannuation fund that is owed by the employer. When such a notice is received by Inland Revenue or there is a short payment of compulsory employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme, new section MK 13 allows the employer tax credits used under sections MK 12(1)(b) or (c) to be used to meet that amount owing. When this occurs, a tax liability of the amount of the credits used becomes payable by the employer to the Commissioner. Miscellaneous provisions New section MK 14 provides that if employer contributions are refunded as a result of an employee opting out of KiwiSaver, the amount of any tax credits claimed in respect of such contributions is refundable to the Commissioner. New section MK 15 provides that if someone is employed by a number of employers who are associated for tax purposes, the associated employers will be considered as one employer for the purposes of claiming the tax credit. This is to prevent associated employers claiming more than one credit for the same employee. Page 17 Private domestic workers who are employers for the purposes of the KiwiSaver Act are treated as paying salary or wages to themselves in the capacity of an employee for the purposes of the employer tax credit rules. This means that they are able to claim the credit if employer contributions are made. Section DC 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (contributions to employees’ superannuation schemes), which allows an employer a deduction for contributions to an employee’s superannuation scheme, is amended to limit the amount of the deduction for contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation to the amount for which no credit was claimed. Definition of “salary and wages” (section 4 of the KiwiSaver Act) The definition of “salary and wages” in section 4 of the KiwiSaver Act has been amended in the following ways: • from 1 July 2007, to clarify that all weekly compensation and paid parental leave payable under Part 7A of the Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987 are salary or wages for the purposes of KiwiSaver; and • from 1 April 2008, to exclude the value of benefits by way of the provision of board or lodging or the use of a house or quarters, or the payment of allowances instead of such benefits (para (b)(i) of the definition of the definition of salary or wages in the Income Tax Act 2004); • to exclude a redundancy payment as defined in the Income Tax Act 2004; • to exclude expenditure on account of an employee and allowances if those amounts are overseas accommodation and other costs of living. For the purposes of compulsory employer contributions, the following are not salary or wages: • all weekly compensation and paid parental leave; • weekly compensation paid by an employer, unless the employer chooses to treat such payments as salary or wages. This means that these payments are not subject to compulsory employer contributions. For contributions to complying funds, bonuses, commissions and other amounts that are not included in gross base salary or wages are excluded. This enables employers that contribute to complying funds to apply current practice (gross base salary, or a variant of this) as a contributions multiplier. This change means non-regular payments are excluded and contributions, including compulsory employer contributions, are calculated on the same gross base salary basis as an employee’s contribution. However, employers will have to use gross salary and wages as a basis for contributions for those employees that choose to opt into KiwiSaver. Page 18 Initial and confirmed back-dated validation of invalid membership (sections 18 and new section 59 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006) Invalid KiwiSaver enrolments occur in a range of circumstances. This can happen, for example, when people join KiwiSaver who are not entitled to because they do not meet the residency requirements. Alternatively, they could be incorrectly automatically enrolled, perhaps because they are under 18 years of age or over the New Zealand superannuation qualification age. A new subpart 4 (sections 59A – 59D) has been added to Part 2 of the KiwiSaver Act (allocation of people to KiwiSaver Schemes) to provide rules for invalid KiwiSaver enrolments. Section 59A of the KiwiSaver Act provides for the circumstances in which an enrolment is invalid and to which the invalid enrolment rules apply. They are when: • a person does not meet the requirements of section 6 of the KiwiSaver Act – that is, at the time the person was automatically enrolled or opted in, he or she is not living or normally living in New Zealand 10 and is not a New Zealand citizen or is entitled in terms of the Immigration Act 1987 to be in New Zealand indefinitely; or • a person who does not meet the requirements of the automatic enrolment rules has been automatically enrolled – for example, when the person is less than 18 years of age or is a casual employee; or • a person who is not entitled to opt in to KiwiSaver does so – for example, because the person is over the New Zealand superannuation qualification age or is already a member of a KiwiSaver scheme. New section 59B provides that the Commissioner or the relevant provider must be notified of an invalid enrolment as soon as practicable after it is discovered. The section also provides that, for a period of time, providers are able to treat as valid enrolments that have been identified as invalid in as far as the administration of the fund is concerned. The time period for initial back-dated validation begins on the earliest of: • the day the Act applied; or • the automatic enrolment rules applied; or • the opt-in rules applied to the person. The time period ends on the earliest of: • three months after the mistake was discovered by the KiwiSaver provider; or • three months after the provider was notified by the Commissioner or other person; or • the day that the provider pays the member’s accumulation for the person to the Commissioner. 10 Excluding state services personnel serving outside New Zealand, employed on New Zealand terms and conditions and serving in a jurisdiction where offers of KiwiSaver scheme membership are lawful. Prior to the date of enactment, the requirement was that the member be personally present in New Zealand at the time of enrolment. Page 19 New section 59C provides for the validation of a member’s enrolment by the end of the time period of initial back-dated validation provided in section 59B if the person meets the rules for membership. This means that all persons who subsequently meet the membership criteria will have their membership validated. In the case of persons who should not be subject to the automatic enrolment rules, enrolment will be validated if they do not opt out and they are eligible to be a member. This section will apply if at the time during the period specified in new section 59B, persons are eligible to be a member because they meet the requirements of section 6 and are: • less than the New Zealand Superannuation qualification age (65 years of age); and • have not opted out under the opt-out provisions in section 18, which have been extended to include persons invalidly automatically enrolled – the invalid enrolment will be validated by the Commissioner and the Commissioner must notify the provider of this. Example 4 Sam finished school when he was 17 and started working for a builder. His employer automatically enrolled him into KiwiSaver. Six months later Sam’s KiwiSaver provider became aware of the fact that even though he was now 18, at the time he was automatically enrolled, he was only 17 years old (and the automatic enrolment rules should not have applied to him), so he had been invalidly enrolled. Sam will be validated as a member and remain enrolled as the opt-out period has expired. New section 59D provides for a refund process that will apply if the time period of initial validation ends and confirmation of backdated validation under section 59C has not occurred. The section sets out what the provider and Commissioner must do. The provider must pay the member’s accumulation to the Commissioner and immediately provide the Commissioner with: • notice of the amount of the contributions received by the provider directly and when they were received; • the amount paid out under mortgage diversion and when paid; and • the amounts of any permitted withdrawals, when they were paid, their type and the amount of any Crown contribution in the permitted withdrawal. The Commissioner must refund: • the amount of the person’s contributions received by the provider minus any crown contribution (such as the member tax credit) and amounts diverted under mortgage diversion or paid out by the provider as a permitted withdrawal; plus • any amount held by the Commissioner (but not yet passed to the provider) net of interest. Page 20 The total amount of contributions refunded will include interest. Interest is calculated using the formula in section 87. For the purposes of the calculation of interest on refunds arising from invalid KiwiSaver enrolments, “interest period” is defined as beginning on the day the Commissioner or the provider received the contribution and ending on the day the Commissioner pays the refund. Section 59(D)(4) provides that the refund is to be made to the person, the person’s employer, the Crown or any other person that made the contribution. The Commissioner can make the refund in proportion to the Commissioner’s best estimate of what they contributed, less amounts diverted under mortgage diversion or paid as a permitted withdrawal. Section 59(D)(5) provides for the treatment of members’ accumulated interest paid to the Commissioner by the provider and any contributions in the holding account. The money is treated as public money, and the Commissioner is required to pay it into the Crown Bank Account. Example 5 After Kate had completed her final year of school she started working at her local bakery over the summer before starting university. Kate’s employer had automatically enrolled her into KiwiSaver. Two months later Kate became aware of the fact that had been automatically enrolled. As she was only 17 years old (under the age of eligibility for KiwiSaver membership) the enrolment was invalid. Kate had already turned 18 by the time she became aware of the fact that she had been invalidly enrolled. This meant her enrolment could be validated or Kate could choose to apply for opt-out under section 18 (extension period). An opt-out has to be made in the period that ends three months after the date on which the Commissioner receives the first contribution in respect of Kate. Regulatory regime for KiwiSaver and complying superannuation funds A number of changes have been made to the regulatory regime for KiwiSaver and complying superannuation funds. The key changes are noted below and the remaining changes will be covered in a Tax Information Bulletin to be published in 2008. Member statements New section 125A of the KiwiSaver Act requires the trustees of KiwiSaver schemes and complying superannuation funds to provide annual personalised statements to each member in the scheme. The statement will need to include, at a minimum, information relating to the contributions received by the scheme on behalf of members and the value of the members’ accumulation at the end of the year. Page 21 Register of complying superannuation funds Section 158 of the KiwiSaver Act has been expanded to enable the KiwiSaver register also to include a sub-register of complying superannuation funds. The information recorded on the sub-register will be largely similar to the information recorded in respect of KiwiSaver schemes, and will include contact details for trustees, the date of approval of complying fund status and annual financial balance dates. The details to be included in the register of complying funds are specified in section 161 of the KiwiSaver Act. The register will apply from 1 April 2008. Unreasonable fees The definition of “complying fund” rules in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 is amended to include a reference to rule 2 in Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act. As such, all complying superannuation fund providers are required to ensure that the fees charged for membership in the complying superannuation fund are not unreasonable. Breach of this rule will amount to a breach of section 35 of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 and may be enforced through the provisions in the Superannuation Schemes Act that allow the Government Actuary to direct, de-register or order the wind-up of a scheme. The generic appeals processes in the Superannuation Schemes Act will also apply. An amendment has been made to section 40 of the Superannuation Schemes Act that enables a Court to enforce the requirement that fees not be unreasonable. Notification of fee changes An amendment has been made to both the KiwiSaver Act and the Superannuation Schemes Act to require trustees of a scheme to notify the Government Actuary of any changes to the fees that are being charged to members in that scheme. Section 189B of the KiwiSaver Act and section 39 of the Superannuation Schemes Act requires a trustee of a scheme to notify the Government Actuary of any changes to the fees charged for membership in a complying superannuation fund or a KiwiSaver scheme. There has been a corresponding amendment to section 40 of the Superannuation Schemes Act and section 189C of the KiwiSaver Act that enables a court to enforce the unreasonable fees requirements. This amendment has replaced the provisions in clause 2 of Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act that allowed enforcement by the Court. The prohibition against unreasonable fees, however, is still contained in clause 2 of Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act. Responsible investment New section 205A has been introduced to require all KiwiSaver schemes and complying superannuation funds to disclose their approach to responsible investment. The disclosure of this approach must be in the form required by the KiwiSaver Act. The Act specifics that the disclosure must be in the investment statements of the scheme and must be included at the end of the “who is providing it for me?” section of the investment statement. The disclosure statement must be in the form prescribed by the section. Failure to comply with this requirement is treated as a failure to comply with the Securities Regulations 1983. This allows the Securities Commission to monitor and enforce compliance with this provision. Page 22 Transfers and insurance Section 9D of the Superannuation Schemes Act has been amended to enable schemes that provide insurance benefits that are linked to superannuation accumulation to reduce those insurance benefits if members elect to transfer their complying superannuation fund accumulation to a KiwiSaver scheme. The insurance benefit may be reduced by an amount that is proportionate to the amount that is transferred out of the complying superannuation fund to a KiwiSaver scheme. For example, if a complying superannuation fund member has an accumulation of $100,000 and elects to transfer $50,000 of that accumulation to a KiwiSaver scheme, the complying superannuation fund may reduce the life insurance benefit attached to that member’s account by $50,000. Further amendments A number of other amendments have also been made to the KiwiSaver Act, including: Application Section 6 of the KiwiSaver Act is amended so that the Act applies to people who, at the time they become subject to the automatic enrolment rules or opt in are, or normally are, living in New Zealand. This amendment applies from the date of assent. Excluding casual employees from the automatic enrolment rules Section 12 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 has been amended to exclude casual employees from the automatic enrolment rules. “Casual employment” is defined by reference to the Holidays Act 2003 as employment that is “intermittent or irregular”. The effect is that if employees are paid holiday pay regularly with their salary or wages they will be excluded from automatic enrolment. Those employees can continue to opt in to KiwiSaver, either by providing a deduction notice to their employer or by contracting directly with a scheme provider. Effect of opting in by employees Section 36 of the KiwiSaver Act is amended to clarify that persons opting in via a provider must specify the name of their employer if they are employees, thereby clarifying that deductions are required from salary and wages. Refund of initial contributions Section 113 of the KiwiSaver Act is amended so that in respect of applications for a refund of initial contributions held in the Inland Revenue holding account on the grounds of significant financial hardship, the Commissioner will have the authority to consider whether alternative sources of funding have been explored and to limit the amount withdrawn. Page 23 Restrictions on transactions New section 117B of the KiwiSaver Act imposes investment restrictions on KiwiSaver schemes with fewer than 20 members. For the purposes of determining the number of members, a person associated with a member under section OD 8(3) of the Income Tax Act will be treated as one person. This provision will: • require a transaction between the scheme provider and a person associated with either the provider or a member to be at market value; • limit to 5% of the scheme’s assets, investments related to or managed by the provider (other than in their capacity as a provider), a member, or a person associated with a provider or member; and • prevent a provider from lending money or providing financial assistance to a member or a person associated with the provider or member.
1 A special report by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue 23 February 2007 NEW TAX RULES FOR OFFSHORE PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT IN SHARES This report will form the basis of an article to appear in the Tax Information Bulletin. The Income Tax Act 2004 has been amended to provide new rules for taxing offshore portfolio investment in shares. The new rules generally apply to an investment by a New Zealand resident in a foreign company when the investor owns less than 10 percent of the company. The main changes are that the “grey list” exemption in the foreign investment fund rules has been removed and a new fair dividend rate method – which broadly taxes 5 percent of a portfolio’s opening value each year – generally applies to interests of less than 10 percent in foreign companies. If the total return on the share portfolio is less than 5 percent then individuals and family trusts pay tax on the lower amount (they pay no tax if the shares make a loss). Under the new rules, investments in Australian-resident companies listed on an approved index of the Australian Stock Exchange, such as the All Ordinaries index (the 500 largest listed companies) are taxed the same as New Zealand investments: they are taxable on dividends if the investment is held on capital account or on dividends and realised gains if held on revenue account. There is a NZ$50,000 cost threshold for investments in offshore companies outside Australia held by individuals, below which these investments continue to be taxable under general income tax rules (for example, on dividends only if held on capital account). Under the new rules, offshore portfolio investment in shares is taxed consistently, regardless of the country where the investment is located and whether the investment is made by an individual directly or through a collective investment vehicle. The new rules manifest the government’s policy that New Zealand residents should be taxed on their world-wide income. Background The previous tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares favoured investment in the eight “grey list” countries (Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States). Investments in companies resident in these countries were taxed only on dividends if they were held on capital account (which was the case for most individuals). Dividend-only taxation was, in many instances, an inappropriate tax base because many foreign companies have a policy of 2 paying low or no dividends. The investor could still, however, derive an economic gain from the investment via an increase in the share price. It was therefore quite easy to achieve a low tax or no tax result for direct portfolio investment in shares outside New Zealand. This could give higher income or more sophisticated taxpayers significant scope to minimise their tax burden by investing offshore. On the other hand, portfolio investment in some high growth and lower tax countries, including trading partners in Asia and Latin America, were over-taxed relative to investment in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. In particular, investors faced significant tax barriers to investment in these countries as a result of the application of the previous foreign investment fund rules, which generally taxed full accrued capital gains (and captured the full effect of currency fluctuation and share price volatility). This inhibited connections with these newer and increasingly important investment destinations. The tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares therefore operated very unevenly. A further problem with the previous “grey list” exemption was the difference in tax treatment between investments in those jurisdictions made directly and those made through a collective investment vehicle. Under the “grey list” exemption, individuals were typically taxed only on dividends because they held their shares on capital account. On the other hand, collective investment vehicles were taxed on their “grey list” investments mostly on a revenue account basis (dividends and realised gains) because they were normally in the business of trading in shares. As was the case with investment in New Zealand companies, collective investment vehicles faced a tax disadvantage under the previous tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares. The new rules are aimed at creating more consistent and coherent tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares by type of investment (direct versus investment through a collective investment vehicle) and jurisdiction (grey list versus non-grey list and New Zealand). In particular, the changes reflect the need to ensure that investments via portfolio investment entities and other managed funds are not tax disadvantaged relative to direct investment; this is important from the perspective of encouraging investment through KiwiSaver. Overall, the new rules attempt to levy a reasonable level of tax on offshore share investments. The exemption for investments in Australian-resident listed companies reflects the fact that Australian dividend yields, like those in New Zealand, are relatively high. The exemption also takes into account the special relationship between New Zealand and Australia under Closer Economic Relations. Consequently, dividend-only taxation is a reasonable approach for Australian-resident listed companies because the Australian tax system encourages distributions, as the New Zealand tax system does. Dividend-only taxation is not feasible for taxing investments in companies resident in jurisdictions whose tax systems do not encourage the payment of dividends. For these investments a reasonable level of tax should be collected each year. The new fair dividend rate method, which broadly taxes 5 percent of a portfolio’s opening value each year, seeks to do so. Proposals to reform the tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares were outlined in the government discussion document, Taxation of investment income, released in June 2005. This discussion document built on the work carried out in earlier reviews, including the Tax Review in 2001. The new offshore tax rules have 3 been the subject of extensive consultation and reflect a number of amendments in the course of policy development, to take into account various concerns raised during consultation. Key features The new tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares mainly involve changes to the foreign investment fund rules in the Income Tax Act 2004. The main features of the new rules are: • The previous exemption in the foreign investment fund rules for investments of less than 10 percent in companies resident in “grey list” countries has been abolished. (The “grey list” countries are Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.) • Investments in Australian-resident companies listed on an approved index of the Australian Stock Exchange, such as the All Ordinaries index (the 500 largest listed companies), are exempt from the foreign investment fund rules. The general income tax rules will continue to apply to these Australian investments: that is, taxable only on dividends if the shares are held on capital account and on dividends and realised share gains if the shares are held on revenue account. However, investments in Australian- resident listed companies held by portfolio investment entities are generally taxable only on dividends. • A NZ$50,000 minimum threshold applies to an individual’s investments in foreign companies other than Australian-resident listed companies. If the original cost of these shares totals NZ$50,000 or less, the foreign investment fund rules do not apply to the individual. This threshold does not generally apply to trusts. • Investments in certain Australian unit trusts that meet minimum investment turnover requirements and use the RWT proxy rules are exempt from the foreign investment fund rules. • There are two temporary exemptions for investments in certain grey list companies for five years and two years respectively. Investments in Guinness Peat Group plc qualify for the five-year exemption (that is, for the 2007-08 to 2011-12 income years) and investments in the New Zealand Investment Trust plc qualify for the two-year exemption (that is, the 2007-08 and 2008-09 income years). Investors who hold shares in these companies on revenue account may elect for the exemption not to apply to them. • There is an exemption for venture capital investments in which grey list companies that were previously resident in New Zealand and maintain a significant New Zealand presence. • There is a limited exemption for offshore shares acquired through employee share purchase schemes if there are restrictions on the disposal of the shares. The exemption applies only for the duration of the restrictions. 4 • The “grey list” exemption will continue to apply for non-portfolio investments of 10 percent or more in foreign companies. However, because of their widely held nature, the following entities do not qualify for this grey list exemption: portfolio investment entities, superannuation schemes, unit trusts, life insurers and group investment funds. • Two new income calculation methods under the foreign investment fund rules – the fair dividend rate and cost methods – have been introduced to apply generally to less than 10 percent interests in foreign companies. • Under the fair dividend rate method: o Tax is paid on 5 percent of the share portfolio’s opening market value each year. o If the investor is an individual or family trust and the total return (dividends and capital gains) on the portfolio is less than 5 percent then tax can be paid on the lower amount with no tax payable when the total return is nil or negative. o Paying tax on an amount lower than 5 percent is achieved by allowing individuals and family trusts to use the comparative value method. Individuals and family trusts have the ability to switch freely between the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods between income years. o Within the same income year an individual or family trust must apply either the fair dividend rate method or the comparative value method. It is therefore not possible to use the fair dividend rate method for shares which produce a total return of over 5 percent (thereby getting the benefit of the 5 percent cap under that method) and use the comparative value method for shares which produce a total return of less than 5 percent in the same year. o Generally only shares held at the start of an income year are taken into account and therefore purchases and sales of shares during a year are ignored. o However, shares that are both purchased after the start of an income year and sold before the end of the same income year are taxed on the lower of 5 percent of their cost or the actual gains made on these “quick sales”. o Dividends are not taxed separately; however, foreign withholding tax deducted from dividends is still available as a foreign tax credit. o There are no foreign investment fund losses. • The fair dividend rate method cannot be used for “guaranteed return”-type investments. The comparative value method must be used for these investments. • The cost method taxes 5 percent of the cost of a person’s investments, with the cost base increased by 5 percent each year to proxy for an increase in the value of the investment. This method is available for investments for which it is not possible to obtain market values (except by 5 independent valuation) and therefore it is not practical to apply the fair dividend rate method. The cost base can be reset by independent valuation every five years. • Investors can use the other methods for calculating foreign investment fund income or loss – branch equivalent, accounting profits, comparative value and deemed rate of return – if they satisfy the conditions for using these methods. • The previous ring-fencing rules for foreign investment fund losses (other than those calculated under the branch equivalent method) have been repealed. • The rules for converting amounts from foreign currency into New Zealand currency have been made consistent. In particular, the changes require taxpayers to be consistent in their use of currency conversion methods. • The rules dealing with when a person enters into or exits from the foreign investment fund rules, such as when a person becomes a resident of New Zealand or the $50,000 minimum threshold is exceeded so a person enters into the rules, have been amended to cater for the new fair dividend rate and cost methods. • Offshore investments which become subject for the first time to the new foreign investment fund rules enter the new rules at their market value on the start date of the new rules (which for most individuals will be 1 April 2007). Application date The new tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares apply for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2007. For the large majority of individuals who have a standard balance date of 31 March, this means that the new rules apply from the start of their 2007-08 income year on 1 April 2007. For early balance date taxpayers, the new tax rules apply from the start of their 2008-09 income year; for example, for a person with a 31 December balance date, the new rules apply from the start of their 2008-09 income year on 1 January 2008. For late balance date taxpayers, the new tax rules apply from the start of their 2007-08 income year; for example, for a person with a 30 June balance date, the new rules apply from the start of their 2007-08 income year on 1 July 2007. A special application date rule applies for companies, group investment funds, or superannuation funds that intend to be portfolio investment entities. These entities may choose to delay the application of the new offshore tax rules until 1 October 2007 when the new tax rules for portfolio investment entities come into force. This deferral is effected by the entity giving a notice to the Commissioner before 1 April 2007 (if the entity exists before that date) or within one month of the day on which the entity comes into existence (if the entity comes into existence between 1 April 2007 and 1 October 2007). This special application date rule for prospective portfolio investment entities is intended to align the start dates of the new offshore tax rules and the new tax rules for portfolio investment entities. 6 It is intended that the special application date rule of 1 October 2007 for entities intending to become portfolio investment entities also applies to early balance date taxpayers that choose to become portfolio tax rate entities (other than those choosing to pay provisional tax under section HL 22) because of the operation of section HL 12(2) and section 38(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Such early balance taxpayers are treated as having a late balance date of 30 September 2007; this means that the new offshore tax rules can also apply to such entities from 1 October 2007. Detailed analysis Interests subject to the new foreign investment fund rules (sections EX 29 to EX 31) The foreign investment fund rules apply to a wide range of interests in foreign entities. The rules broadly seek to tax the income earned by foreign entities on interests held by New Zealand residents. The rules provide a mechanism for attributing the income of a foreign entity to a New Zealand resident who has an interest in that entity. In particular, the following interests, subject to certain exemptions discussed below, are subject to the foreign investment fund rules: • Interests in a foreign company (including a foreign unit trust). These interests are measured by reference to direct income interests as defined in section EX 31. • Rights to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme. • Rights to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy. The main change to the scope of the previous foreign investment fund rules is that the general exemption for interests in grey list companies no longer applies to less than 10 percent (that is, portfolio) interests. $50,000 minimum threshold for application of foreign investment fund rules (sections CQ 5 and DN 6) A minimum threshold applies to an individual’s investments in foreign companies below which the foreign investment fund rules do not apply. The term “individual” is used here to refer to a natural person. If the original cost of these shares totals NZ$50,000 or less at all times in an income year, the foreign investment fund rules do not apply for that year. The individual investor will continue to pay tax only on dividends if they hold the shares on capital account. This minimum threshold also encompasses interests in foreign superannuation schemes and life insurance policies. It should be noted that this rule is a threshold rather than an exemption. Therefore, if the cost of a person’s offshore shares exceed $50,000 all their shares are subject to the foreign investment fund rules and not just the excess costing more than $50,000. The $50,000 minimum threshold takes into account brokerage fees if these form part of the cost of acquiring any shares. 7 The exchange rate on the date of purchase of any shares in foreign currency should be applied for the purposes of the NZ$50,000 minimum threshold. This information can be obtained from websites which contain on-line currency conversion calculators – for example, www.oanda.com/convert/classic , which goes back to January 1990. The New Zealand Reserve Bank’s monthly exchange rate data is also acceptable to Inland Revenue for this purpose: www.rbnz.govt.nz/statistics. Exchange rate information is also available from all major trading banks. A married couple or a couple in a de facto relationship or civil union can qualify for a total NZ$100,000 threshold. This can be achieved by half of the shares costing $100,000 being held in each spouse’s name, the shares being wholly jointly owned, or a combination of individual and joint ownership. Each spouse would have to add half the cost of the jointly owned shares to their individual shares to ascertain if they come under or over the threshold. For example, if each spouse holds shares in their own name costing $20,000 and jointly own shares costing $60,000, then both spouses would qualify for the threshold. Each spouse’s $50,000 total is calculated by adding the shares they individually own ($20,000) and half ($30,000) of the shares they jointly own. However, if one spouse in this example instead individually owned shares costing $40,000 then that spouse would not qualify for the threshold: the spouse’s total would be $70,000 ($40,000 plus $30,000 share of jointly owned shares). The other spouse would still qualify for the threshold. A special rule is available for establishing whether investments that were acquired before 1 January 2000 fall within the minimum threshold. For these shares, the market value at 1 April 2007 may be halved and used to calculate the amount to be added to the cost of investments acquired on or after 1 January 2000 to determine whether the minimum threshold is exceeded. The rule is designed to assist investors who have no record of the cost of investments they have held for many years. Treating the cost of pre-2000 interests as half of the market value is optional but, once elected, the treatment cannot be changed in subsequent income years. Also, if this option is chosen it must be used for all investments acquired before 1 January 2000. The NZ$50,000 minimum threshold for the application of the new offshore tax rules also applies to the following small range of trusts: • The settlor of the trust is a relative or legal guardian of the beneficiary, or a person associated with a relative or legal guardian of the beneficiary, and is required by a court order to pay damages or compensation to the beneficiary. • The settlor is the ACC. • The trust is of the estate of a deceased person and the current income year begins before the date that is five years after the person’s death. • The settlor of the trust is the estate of a deceased person and a court order requires the proceeds of damages or compensation to be settled on the trust for the beneficiaries of the trust. Family trusts that are not within the limited range outlined above, such as discretionary trusts, do not get the benefit of the $50,000 minimum threshold because of the risk of multiple trusts being used for the benefit of the same individuals. 8 If an investor holds shares in a year costing more than the NZ$50,000 threshold and disposes of a sufficient quantity of them during the same year to bring the cost of shares held under the threshold, they will still be subject to the new offshore tax rules in that year (as they have held shares costing greater than NZ$50,000 for part of the year). They will, however, qualify for the threshold in the following year, assuming they do not purchase any additional shares in that year. Shares in foreign companies, that are covered by the various exemptions from the foreign investment fund rules, such as those for investments in Australian-resident listed companies and certain grey list companies, do not count towards the NZ$50,000 minimum threshold. The NZ$50,000 minimum threshold is based on the cost of offshore shares held rather than their market value. This is so taxpayers can refer to actual cost when determining whether the threshold applies to them, rather than having to track changing market values over time. The NZ$50,000 minimum threshold is designed to reduce compliance costs. The threshold attempts to strike a balance between accuracy and simplicity for individual investors with relatively small amounts invested offshore and recognises that any additional accuracy gained from applying the more complex foreign investment fund rules (compared with dividend-only taxation) may be outweighed by the compliance costs. Exemption for investments in Australian-resident listed companies (section EX 33C) Investments in Australian-resident listed companies are generally exempt from the foreign investment fund rules. This means that investors, other than portfolio investment entities, who invest directly in Australian-resident companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange will continue to be taxed under general income tax rules – they will be taxed on dividends only if the share is held on capital account, and on dividends and realised share gains if held on revenue account. Investments in Australian-resident listed companies by portfolio investment entities will be taxable only on dividends, subject to the portfolio investment entity having full equity risk in the Australian share. This is because any realised share gains are treated as excluded income under section CX 44C. The exemption for Australian-resident companies is restricted to companies listed on an approved index of the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). The approved ASX indices include the ASX All Ordinaries (the 500 largest listed companies), ASX 50 Leaders and ASX 200. The exemption should cater for most New Zealanders’ portfolio share investments in Australia. The following website contains a list of companies on the ASX All Ordinaries index: http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/au/page.topic/indices\_asxallo/2,3 ,2,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0.html 9 The exemption applies only to interests in Australian-resident companies that are required to have a franking account in accordance with Australian tax law. Generally, a New Zealand investor that receives a “franked” dividend from a company that is listed on the ASX All Ordinaries index will be entitled to this exemption from the foreign investment fund rules. The exemption should therefore be relatively easy to self-assess. Interests in Australian unit trusts do not generally qualify for the Australian exemption because they are not required to have a franking account and will therefore be subject to the new foreign investment fund rules (an exception for interests in certain Australian unit trusts is discussed below). The exemption does not apply to an investment in an Australian-resident company whose residence tie-breaks to a country other than Australia or New Zealand under an Australian tax treaty. This is because such a company may not be subject to full Australian or New Zealand tax. New Zealand’s Inland Revenue has a close working relationship with the Australian Tax Office, which will allow the use of this exemption to be monitored. Australian unit trusts (section EX 33D) Investments in certain Australian unit trusts that turn over a sufficient proportion of their investments each year and use the RWT proxy rules for meeting the tax obligations of its New Zealand investors are exempt from the new foreign investment fund rules. For the exemption to apply the Australian unit trust is required to turn over a minimum of 25% of its profit-making assets each year. This requirement would encourage distributions to be made to New Zealand-resident unit holders. The minimum turnover requirement does not take into account investments in loss because otherwise there could be an incentive to dispose only loss-making investments to meet the minimum turnover requirement. Inland Revenue has no problem with shares being sold and immediately repurchased for the purpose of satisfying the turnover requirement (aka “bed and breakfast” arrangements). The exemption is only available to those investors in the qualifying Australian unit trust who elect to use the RWT proxy mechanism. This is because this mechanism gives assurance that New Zealand tax liabilities will be satisfied. It is also expected that the RWT proxy, who will generally be a New Zealand-based agent, will be able to advise investors on whether an Australian unit trust meets the turnover requirements. The exemption for investments in Australian unit trusts that meet minimum turnover requirements and where the investor elects to use the RWT proxy mechanism is meant to accommodate current arrangements, where investors in certain Australian unit trusts have their tax liabilities satisfied under the RWT proxy rules, thereby reducing compliance obligations. 10 Australian unit trusts were not generally included in the exemption from the foreign investment fund rules in section EX 33C for Australian investments because they could be used as roll-up vehicles to invest outside Australia in companies that pay little or no dividends (and therefore avoid the new offshore tax rules). New Zealand investors could invest in these vehicles and derive income in the form of capital gain, without a tax liability arising on this income in either Australia or New Zealand. The minimum turnover requirement in the limited exemption in section EX 33D addresses this concern. Temporary exemptions for investments in certain grey list companies (section EX 33B) There are two temporary exemptions from the foreign investment fund rules for five years and two years respectively for investments in certain grey list companies (that is, companies resident in Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States). Five-year exemption for investments in New Zealand-owned grey list companies Under this temporary exemption, investments in companies that meet certain criteria would continue to be taxable under the general income tax rules for a period of five years, that is, for the 2007-08 to 2011-12 income years. The main criteria for this temporary exemption are that the investment is in a grey list company that on 17 May 2006 (the date of introduction of this legislation): • is listed on a recognised exchange in both New Zealand and a grey list country; • is liable to income tax in a grey list country; • has more than 20,000 shareholders who have addresses in New Zealand on the company’s New Zealand share register and these shareholders hold shares in the company carrying voting interest of more than 50 percent; and • has assets of which more than 50 percent in total value are shares in other companies carrying voting interest of more than 50 percent. For this exemption to apply the grey list company must within 30 days after the date of enactment (18 December 2006) of this legislation, give to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue notice that on 17 May 2006 the company satisfied the above criteria. The rationale for this temporary exemption is to allow time for completion of the government’s review of the controlled foreign company tax rules. Pending the outcome of this review, which includes consideration of whether the controlled foreign company rules should exempt income from active investment while continuing to tax income from passive investment, some grey list companies may 11 consider relocating to New Zealand. If this were the case, the offshore tax rules for portfolio investments would not apply to investments in such companies. The outcome of this review would be important for a company like Guinness Peat Group plc in its consideration of whether to relocate, as its primary investment would likely be an active investment in a controlled foreign company. Two-year exemption for investments in grey list companies investing in Australasian shares There is also a temporary exemption of two years (that is, the 2007-08 and 2008-09 income years) from the new foreign investment fund rules for interests in grey list companies that invest primarily in Australasian equities. For investors to qualify for this two-year holiday, the grey list company would need to have at least 90 percent of its assets (by value) invested in New Zealand-resident listed companies and Australian-resident listed companies; also at least 50 percent of the grey list company’s assets (by value) must be invested in New Zealand resident companies. This Australasian investment requirement would have to be maintained throughout the two-year exemption period. Further criteria for this exemption are that the grey list company must, on 17 May 2006 (the date of introduction of this legislation): • be listed on a recognised exchange in both New Zealand and in a grey list country; • have shareholders of which more than 40 percent have addresses in New Zealand on the company’s New Zealand share register; • be liable to income tax in a grey list country; • have assets of which at least 50 percent in total value are shares in New Zealand-resident companies; and • have assets of which at least 90 percent in total value are shares in New Zealand-resident listed companies and Australian resident listed companies. It is also necessary for the grey list company in the 30-day period after the date of enactment (18 December 2006) of this legislation to give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue notice that on 17 May 2006 it satisfied the above criteria. The purpose of this temporary exemption is to allow the relevant grey list companies time to relocate to New Zealand and become portfolio investment entities. This is because New Zealand investors in grey list entities that have a predominantly Australasian investment policy would benefit if this happened. Such entities would benefit under the portfolio investment entity tax rules from not having their capital gains from trading Australasian shares taxed. 12 Revenue account investor election (section EX 33B(3)) Investors who hold shares on revenue account that qualify for the temporary exemptions from the new foreign investment fund rules can elect that the exemption not apply, which means that such shares will be taxed under the foreign investment fund rules. The election is made in a return of income for an income year; the election is irrevocable and applies for that income year and the remaining years of the exemption period. Institutional investors (that is, portfolio investment entities and other managed funds) would generally hold their investments on revenue account, and would be taxable on any gains that are realised. In many cases, the fair dividend rate method would result in a lower tax liability for such investors. A fair dividend rate method would also be easier for managed funds to apply under the portfolio investment entity tax rules. This election is likely to be particularly beneficial for portfolio investment entities as attribution of income to investors would be simple under the fair dividend rate method. In contrast, if the general tax rules were to apply, investors would be subject to tax on realised gains on these investments. This would require deferred gains and losses to be allocated across tax years and current and future investors, which would be difficult for portfolio investment entities to manage. Publication of list of qualifying companies An amendment has been made to the secrecy provisions to allow Inland Revenue to publish the names of companies that it has received notification from that they meet the criteria for the temporary exemptions from the foreign investment fund rules (section 81(4)(mc) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). Guinness Peat Group plc has given notice to the Commissioner under section EX 33B(1)(b) that it meets the criteria for the five-year exemption. New Zealand Investment Trust plc has given notice to the Commissioner under section EX 33B(2)(b) that it meets the criteria for the two-year exemption. Venture capital exemption (section EX 33(3) and (4)) There is an exemption from the new offshore tax rules that is designed for venture capital investments in New Zealand-resident start-up companies that migrate offshore to gain access to additional equity financing. Without this exemption the New Zealand investors could end up holding portfolio interests subject to the foreign investment fund rules. The policy basis for this exemption is that venture capital investments do not compete with investment via New Zealand managed funds and therefore are not the target of the new rules. The criteria for the venture capital exemption are: • The investment is shares in a grey list company that was previously a New Zealand-resident company. 13 • The investor acquired the shares before the company migrated from New Zealand and before the shares were listed on a recognised exchange. It is intended that these investors will be able to continue to invest in the company after it has listed without losing the exemption. • The grey list company has a fixed establishment in New Zealand, which has at least $1 million of expenditure (not including interest) each year or 10 full-time employees or contractors providing services. • Before migrating, the company had been tax-resident in New Zealand for a minimum of 12 months and had the majority of its assets and employees in New Zealand for at least a year. • The exemption lasts for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates. • The shares would enter the foreign investment fund rules at market value at the end of the 10-year exemption period. The exemption also applies to shares purchased in a grey list company that owns a New Zealand company that meets the above criteria. This variation to the exemption caters for situations where shares in a grey-list company are received in exchange for shares in a New Zealand-resident company. The 10-year exemption period starts from the income year in which the grey list company acquires a majority of the shares of the New Zealand-resident company. Employee share purchase scheme exemption (section EX 33(5)) There is a limited exemption from the new foreign investment fund rules for individuals who hold shares in a foreign company acquired through an employee share purchase scheme that satisfies the following criteria: • The foreign company is resident in a grey list country and is the employer of the employee or owns, directly or indirectly, the New Zealand-resident employer of the employee. • The shares are acquired through employment under a share purchase agreement (as defined in section CE 7). • There are restrictions in the share purchase agreement applying to the disposal of the shares for a period that satisfies the requirements in section CE 3. Employees have up to six months from the date the restrictions on disposal no longer apply to dispose of their shares before the foreign investment fund rules apply to the shares. After this period, the shares would enter the foreign investment fund rules at their market value. Non-portfolio grey list exemption (section EX 33(1) and (2)) Interests of 10 percent or more, (non-portfolio interests) in grey list companies (those resident in Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States) are exempt from the new foreign investment fund rules. The 14 company must be liable for income tax in the grey list country it is resident in for this exemption to apply. The investor’s interest in the grey list company must be 10 percent or more at all times in the relevant income year for the exemption to apply. If the interest falls below 10 percent after the start of the income year and the fair dividend rate method can be applied to the interest there will be no foreign investment fund income in that year. The grey list exemption for interests of 10 percent or more in grey list companies does not apply if the interest is held by a portfolio investment entity, superannuation scheme, unit trust, life insurer or a group investment fund. This exception is because of the widely held nature of such investors. Other exemptions from the new rules Other exemptions from the foreign investment fund rules which existed before these changes, such as those for interests covered by the controlled foreign company rules and employment-related pensions continue to apply, other than the previous general grey list exemption. Methods for calculating foreign investment fund income or loss The amendment Act introduces two new methods for calculating foreign investment fund income – the fair dividend rate method and the cost method. It is expected that the fair dividend rate method will be the primary method for calculating foreign investment fund income for less than 10 percent interests in foreign companies. The only significant exceptions to this would be when individuals and family trusts choose to use the comparative value method when the total annual return from an investment is less than 5 percent and when the comparative value method (or deemed rate of return method) is required to be used for portfolio investments which have a guaranteed return nature. These exceptions are discussed further below. The comparative value method takes into account the full economic returns (capital gains and dividends) from an investment. The deemed rate of return method is the back-up method to the comparative value method and can be applied when current market value information about an investment is not available and is based on the original cost of the investment. The branch equivalent and accounting profits methods remain available for use by taxpayers who satisfy the conditions for their use. Significant information is required to use these methods, which are designed to tax investors on their share of a foreign company’s underlying earnings. Fair dividend rate method (sections EX 44B to EX 44E) Under the new fair dividend rate method tax is paid on 5 percent of the opening market value of an investor’s offshore portfolio share investments held at the start of an income year. However, if the investor is an individual or family trust and the actual 15 return is less than 5 percent, tax can be paid on this lower amount with no tax payable when the total return is negative. On-line calculators will be available on the Inland Revenue website to assist people to calculate their foreign investment fund income using the fair dividend rate method. Non-natural person investors (other than family trusts) are taxed on 5 percent of the value of shares held each year. There is no variation to this rate in years where the investor earns less than 5 percent. General features of fair dividend rate method The fair dividend rate method: • taxes 5 percent of the market value of offshore shares held at the start of an income year; • applies only to portfolio investments in offshore shares – that is, interests of less than 10 percent in a foreign company – that have verifiable market values; • works on a pooled approach, rather than on an investment-by-investment approach, for shares that qualify; • ignores purchases and sales of shares during a year, except when the shares are bought and sold in the same year – separate “quick sale” rules, described below, apply for these. Therefore, there is no foreign investment fund income in the year of purchase in relation to shares that are acquired after the start of an income year. Conversely, there is no reduction in foreign investment fund income in relation to shares held at the start of an income year that are sold during the year; • does not tax dividends separately (this is achieved through section EX 47). However, foreign withholding tax deducted from dividends is still available as a foreign tax credit under section LC 1(1) and (4); and • does not result in foreign investment fund losses. The primary formula for the fair dividend rate method is: 5% x opening market value (total for all shares for which method is used) plus quick sale adjustment (for shares bought and sold in same year, discussed below). Application of method to individuals and family trust investors For individual investors and family trusts, a variation to the fair dividend rate approach outlined above is allowed. Under this variation if investors can show that their total return on all their offshore shares, for which the fair dividend rate method is allowed to be used, is less than 5 percent of the opening market value they are taxable on the lower amount. If the total return for the year is nil or negative, no tax would be payable (and no loss recognised). The total return is calculated using the comparative value formula in section EX 44: 16 (closing market value of shares held + total sales proceeds + dividends received) – (opening market value of shares held + total value of purchases) Example 1 When an individual makes a total return of more than 5 percent John holds offshore shares that have a market value of $100,000 at the start of the year. These shares are worth $115,000 at the end of the year. John also derives a $10,000 dividend. Under the fair dividend rate method, John pays tax on 5 percent of $100,000 or a lower amount if his return for the year is less than 5 percent. No tax is payable if he makes a negative return. John's total return for the year is the $15,000 capital gain on his shares and the dividend of $10,000. His total return is therefore $25,000. However, his taxable income for the year is limited to 5 percent of the opening value of his shares. This would result in taxable income of $5,000. (Under the fair dividend rate method the $10,000 dividend is not separately taxed.) Example 2 When an individual makes a total return of less than 5 percent Mary also holds offshore shares that have a market value of $100,000 at the start of the year. These shares increase in value to $102,000 at the end of the year. Mary also receives a $1,000 dividend. As in the previous example, Mary would pay tax on 5 percent of $100,000 (her opening value) unless she can show that she made a return of less than this. Mary's total return for the year is $3,000 (comprising a capital gain of $2,000 and a dividend of $1,000), which is less than 5 percent of her opening value of $100,000. Therefore, Mary is only taxed on $3,000. Example 3 When an individual makes a loss Judy holds offshore shares that have a market value of $100,000 at the start of the year, which decrease in value to $75,000 at the end of the year. She also receives a $10,000 dividend. As in the previous examples, Judy would be taxable on 5 percent of the opening value of her shares unless she can show that her total return for the year is less than 5 percent. Judy's total return for the year comprises a capital loss of $25,000 and the dividend of $10,000. Her net return is therefore a loss of $15,000. Because Judy has made a 17 negative return on her offshore shares, no tax is payable under the fair dividend rate method. Application of method to managed funds and other non-natural person investors For New Zealand managed funds, including portfolio investment entities, and other non-natural persons (except family trusts) the variation outlined above does not apply. This means that tax payable is on a fixed 5 percent return irrespective of how investments perform. A fixed fair dividend rate is more consistent with the portfolio investment entity rules than a variable rate. For most managed funds – referred to in the legislation as “unit valuers” – the 5 percent fair dividend rate applies to the average value of the entity’s offshore portfolio share investments for the year. That is, for investment vehicles, such as unit trusts and superannuation funds, that calculate the value of their investments and their investors’ units on a regular basis, the taxable income for each valuation period (which could range from a day to a quarter) would be calculated using the following formula: 5% x market value of investments at start of period x the number of days in the period number of days in the income year The values that are used by unit valuers for unit pricing purposes are acceptable to Inland Revenue for purposes of applying the fair dividend rate method provided a consistent approach is taken. This policy should cater for daily unit valuers in relation to the treatment of weekends and public holidays. Rules for shares that are bought and sold in the same income year (“quick sales”) Shares that are purchased after the start of the income year and then sold before the end of the same income year are taxed on the lower of 5 percent of the cost of the purchase or the actual gains made on these “quick sales”. The so-called “quick sale” rules are designed to tax shares that are bought and sold within the same income year – that is, for a taxpayer with a standard income year, shares that are purchased after 1 April and sold before the following 31 March. Without these rules, no tax would be payable on these shares as they would not be reflected in the value of shares held at the start of the year or in the value of shares held at the start of the following year. The quick sale rules for investors (other than daily valuers) allow them to pay tax based on the lower of 5 percent of the average cost or the actual gains made on any “quick sales”. In the legislation the amount which is added to the standard fair dividend rate formula (5% x opening market value) to take account of shares bought and sold in the same income year is referred to as the “quick sale adjustment”. The quick sale adjustment is calculated as the lower of 5 percent of the cost of shares that are bought and sold in the same year – referred to the legislation as the “peak 18 holding adjustment” – and the actual gains made on any such shares – referred to in the legislation as “quick sale gains”. The peak holding adjustment is the total of the amounts (a pooled approach) calculated for each foreign company using the formula: 5% x quick sales x average cost. The “quick sales” amount in the peak holding adjustment formula is the lower of: • the difference between the greatest number of shares held in the foreign company during the income year and the number of shares held in the foreign company at the start of the income year; and • the difference between the greatest number of shares held in the foreign company during the income year and the number of shares held in the foreign company at the end of the income year. The “average cost” component in the peak holding adjustment formula is the amount of expenditure that the shareholder incurs during the income year in acquiring or increasing their shareholding in a foreign company divided by the total number of shares acquired in the foreign company during the income year. Using the average cost approach takes account of the situation when different parcels of shares in the same company are purchased during the year at different prices. Taking the average cost of all such share parcels purchased in the year is easier than requiring investors to track the cost of each share that is subsequently sold. The “quick sale gains” component of the quick sale adjustment is the greater of zero and the total amount for all shares bought and sold in foreign companies during the year (a pooled approach) calculated by taking the total amount derived from holding (including any dividends) or disposing of the shares in a foreign company and subtracting the total expenditure incurred in acquiring the interest (this would not include holding costs such as interest). In ascertaining whether shares are bought and sold in the same year for the purposes of the “quick sale gains” part of the quick sale adjustment, a last-in-first-out (LIFO) method applies to determine whether shares in a foreign company sold in a year were purchased in the same year. Capping the quick sale adjustment to the actual gains made on shares that are bought and sold in the same income year, militates against over-taxation of quick sales that could occur if there was a high turnover of shares. Example 4 Jane holds 10,000 shares worth $30,000 in Co.A and 10,000 shares worth $50,000 in Co.B on 1 April 2007. On 30 May, she buys another 1,000 shares in Co.A for $4,000 and on 15 October she buys another 4,000 shares in Co.A for $20,000. On 30 November she receives dividends of $1,000 from Co.A. and $2,000 from Co.B. On 19 2 February 2008, Jane sells 3,000 of her Co.A shares for $15,000. At the end of the year, Jane’s remaining 12,000 Co.A shares are worth $48,000 and her 10,000 Co.B shares are worth $55,000. Jane would be taxable on $4,000 (that is, 5% of $80,000) under the standard fair dividend rate method. However, Jane also bought 3,000 shares in Co.A during the year that she sold before the end of the year. The average cost of these 3,000 shares is $4.80 ($24,000 cost of acquiring new shares in the year divided by 5,000, the number of new shares). Her quick sale adjustment for these shares is the lesser of her peak holding adjustment and her quick sale gains. Her peak holding adjustment is: 5% x 3,000 (quick sales) x $4.80 (average cost) = $720 Jane’s quick sale gains takes into account the total proceeds from holding or disposing of shares she bought and sold in Co.A during the year. These proceeds include a $200 dividend, which is the pro rata share of the $1,000 dividend paid on the Co.A shares that is attributable to the 3,000 shares bought and sold in the year (the 3,000 shares sold divided by the total 15,000 shares multiplied by the $1,000 dividend). Jane’s remaining proceeds are the $15,000 sale proceeds from the 3,000 quick sale shares. From the total proceeds she subtracts the expenditure on the quick sale shares, which is the number of quick sale shares (3,000) multiplied by their average cost ($4.80) as calculated above. Therefore Jane’s quick sale gains are: ($15,000 + $200) – $14,400 = $800 Jane’s quick sale adjustment is therefore $720 (being the lesser of the peak holding adjustment of $720 and the quick sale gains of $800). Jane’s income under the fair dividend rate method is the sum of the opening value result ($4,000) and the quick sale adjustment ($720). This is $4,720. Jane could be taxable on a lesser amount if she is able to show that her total return under the comparative value method in section EX 44 is less than $4,720. This option is only available for natural persons and family trusts. Jane calculates that her actual return is: ($103,000 + $15,000 + $3,000) – ($80,000 + $24,000) = $17,000 As Jane’s total return is more than $4,720, she is taxed at her personal tax rate on $4,720. Example 5 NZ Co. holds 20,000 shares worth $120,000 in Foreign Co.A and 10,000 shares worth $80,000 in Foreign Co.B on 1 April 2007. On 15 May, NZ Co. buys a further 5,000 shares in Foreign Co.A for $30,000 and a further 5,000 shares in Foreign Co.B for $40,000. On 1 October NZ Co. receives a $2,000 dividend from Foreign Co.A. On 1 February 2008, NZ Co. sells 2,000 shares in Foreign Co.A for $14,000 and 3,000 shares in Foreign Co.B for $18,000. 20 NZ Co. would be taxable on $10,000 (that is, 5% of $200,000) under the standard fair dividend rate method. However, because NZ Co. also bought 2,000 shares in Foreign Co.A and 3,000 shares in Foreign Co.B during the year that it sold before the end of the year it would also have to calculate a quick sale adjustment. NZ Co’s quick sale adjustment for the shares it has bought and sold during the year is the lesser of its peak holding adjustment and its quick sale gains. NZ Co’s peak holding adjustment is the total of the amounts from applying the peak holding adjustment formula for each of Foreign Co.A and Foreign Co.B. For Foreign Co.A the calculation is: 5% x 2,000 (quick sales) x $6.00 (average cost) = $600 For Foreign Co.B the calculation is: 5% x 3,000 (quick sales) x $8.00 (average cost) = $1,200 NZ Co’s peak holding adjustment is therefore $1,800 ($600 + $1,200). NZ Co’s quick sale gains is the total of the amounts from applying the quick sale gains formula for each of Foreign Co.A and Foreign Co.B. NZ Co’s quick sale gains for Foreign Co.A takes into account NZ Co’s total proceeds from holding or disposing of the 2,000 shares in Foreign Co.A that it bought and sold during the year. These proceeds include a $160 dividend which is the proportion of the $2,000 dividend paid on the Foreign Co.A shares that is attributable to the 2,000 shares sold during the year (the 2,000 shares sold divided by the total of 25,000 shares multiplied by the $2,000 dividend). NZ Co’s other proceeds from Foreign Co.A are the $14,000 sale proceeds from the 2,000 quick sale shares. From the total proceeds ($14,160) NZ Co. subtracts the expenditure on the quick sale shares which is $12,000 (the 2,000 quick sale shares multiplied by their average cost of $6.00). Therefore, NZ Co’s quick sale gains calculation for Foreign Co.A is: ($14,000 + $160) – $12,000 = $2,160 NZ Co’s quick sale gains calculation for Foreign Co.B takes into account the total proceeds from holding or disposing of the 3,000 shares in Foreign Co.A that it bought and sold during the year, that is the $18,000 sale proceeds. From this amount NZ Co. subtracts the expenditure on the quick sale shares, which is the number of quick sale shares (3,000) multiplied by their average cost ($8.00). Therefore, NZ Co’s quick sale gains calculation for Foreign Co.B is: $18,000 – $24,000 = $6,000 loss Combining the quick sale gains results for Foreign Co.A ($2,160) and Foreign Co.B ($6,000 loss) produces a $3,840 loss. Because the final result cannot be less than zero, NZ Co’s quick sale gains amount is zero. 21 NZ Co’s quick sale adjustment is therefore zero, being the lesser of its peak holding adjustment ($1,800) and its quick sale gains (zero). NZ Co’s foreign investment fund income under the fair dividend rate method is therefore $10,000 (based on the $200,000 opening market value of its interests). The quick sale rules do not apply to entities that value their investments daily. Where the valuation period is more than a day (for example, a month or a quarter) the entity needs to apply the quick sale rules to shares bought and sold during the respective valuation period. For example, a unit trust that values its investments quarterly would apply the quick sale rules to any shares that are bought after the start of the quarter and sold before the end of the quarter. Share reorganisations There are also rules to deal with situations where an investor buys and sells shares during an income year (or valuation period for managed funds) and there is a share split between when the shares were purchased and when they were sold. This is described as a “share reorganisation” in the legislation. The rules establish the average cost of the “equivalent interest” that is sold for the purposes of the applying the fair dividend rate method. Foreign investment fund losses No foreign investment fund losses can be produced under the fair dividend rate method (section EX 44B(4)). A matching restriction on foreign investment fund losses has been included in the comparative value method which applies when individuals and family trusts choose to use that method instead of the fair dividend rate method for their less than 10 percent interests in foreign companies in an income year because the total return from all such investments in the year is less than 5 percent of opening market value. If a person has a total foreign investment fund loss under the comparative value method from all their less than 10 percent interests in the year the loss is reduced to zero (section EX 44(6B) and (6C)). Example 6 Joe has portfolio interests (less than 10 percent interests) in Foreign Co A and Foreign Co B. Joe elects to use the comparative value method (instead of the fair dividend rate method) in a year. His investment in Foreign Co A produces a foreign investment fund loss of $1,000 and his investment in Foreign Co B produces foreign investment fund income of $400. Joe’s total foreign investment fund loss for the income year is $600. Section EX 44(6C) reduces this total foreign investment fund loss to zero. This rule ensures a similar treatment of foreign investment fund losses for less than 10 percent interests in foreign companies under both the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods. The above restriction on foreign investment fund losses does not apply if the less than 10% interest in a foreign company is a “guaranteed return” investment of a type listed in section EX 40(8)(a) (discussed below). The foreign investment fund loss restriction 22 does not apply to these interests because they are subject to comprehensive taxation under the comparative value method (which means they are not allowed the benefit of the 5 percent cap under the fair dividend rate method). Cost method (section EX 45B) A cost-based method is available for offshore portfolio investments for which it is not possible to obtain market values (except by independent valuation) and therefore it is not practical to apply the fair dividend rate method. This back-up method taxes 5 percent of the cost of a person’s investments, with the cost base increased by 5 percent each year to proxy for an increase in the value of the investment. The main features of the cost method are: • It taxes 5 percent of the cost of the portfolio investment each year plus an uplift of 5 percent to account for investment growth. • No tax is payable in the year in which the investment is acquired, as there would be no cost base at the start of the year. • The cost base for each subsequent year (referred to as the “opening value” in the legislation) is adjusted by any sales and purchases in the previous year and increased by the foreign investment fund income for the previous year (5 percent of the “opening value” in the previous year), to account for investment growth. • Any dividends derived are not taxed separately (this is achieved through section EX 47). However, foreign withholding tax deducted from dividends is still available as a foreign tax credit under section LC 1(1) and (4). Any dividends are not subtracted from the opening value in the next year (this is because 5 percent deemed growth is likely, on average, to underestimate the actual increase in the value of the investment). • The rules for shares bought and sold within the same income year (“quick sales”) apply to portfolio investments for which the cost method is used. • The method applies on an interest-by-interest basis rather than on a pooled basis. • No foreign investment fund losses can be produced under the cost method. Investors also have the ability to use an independent valuation as the initial cost base if there is no readily available market value for the investment (for example, because the company is not listed). This would be a one-off valuation requirement to allow these investments to access the cost method. Investors also have the ability to re-value their interests in companies subject to the cost method through an independent valuation and adjust their opening value accordingly. This allows investors to lower their cost base if the capital value of their investment has decreased. This resetting of the cost base through an independent valuation can be done once every five income years. The main example of an interest for which the cost method is allowed to be used would be shares in a foreign company that are not listed on a recognised exchange and 23 for which a verifiable market value is therefore not readily available (meaning it is not practical to apply the fair dividend rate method). Example 7 On 1 April 2007, Peter holds an interest in a family company that is resident in the United Kingdom. He put in capital of $20,000 for which he received an 8 percent shareholding. The market value of his holding cannot be obtained without an independent valuation. Therefore, Peter is allowed to use the cost method. Under this method, his taxable income for the 2007-08 year would be calculated as 5 percent of $20,000 = $1,000. In the 2008-09 year, assuming Peter has not acquired or disposed of any interests in the company, his cost base is deemed to have increased by 5 percent (that is, by $1,000). His taxable income in the 2008-09 tax year would therefore be 5 percent of $21,000 = $1,050. His taxable income in the 2009-10 year would be 5 percent of $22,050 = $1,102 (again assuming he has not acquired or disposed of any interests in the company). Rules for shares that are bought and sold in the same income year (“quick sales”) Shares that are purchased after the start of the income year and then sold before the end of the same income year are taxed at 5 percent of their average cost. As with the fair dividend rate method, these rules are necessary because without them no tax would be payable on such shares as they would not be included in the opening value. The quick sale rules in the cost method are similar to those in the fair dividend rate method except that the actual gains on quick sales are not taken into account. Therefore, the rules are simpler to apply as they are based simply on 5 percent of the average cost of quick sale shares. The term “quick sales” in the legislation refers to shares that are bought and sold during the income year. The “average cost” of these quick sale shares is calculated by dividing the total expenditure incurred on acquiring new shares in the year by the total number of shares acquired in the year. Using the average cost approach takes account of the situation when different parcels of shares in the same company are purchased during the year at different prices. Other foreign investment fund calculation methods Although the new fair dividend rate and cost methods will be the primary methods for calculating foreign investment fund income for less than 10 percent interests in foreign companies, investors have the option of using the other methods for calculating foreign investment fund income or loss - branch equivalent, accounting profits, comparative value and deemed rate of return - if they satisfy the conditions for using these methods. 24 Removal of foreign investment fund loss ring-fencing rules (sections DN 5, DN 8, IE 4 and IG 5) The previous ring-fencing rules in section DN 8 for foreign investment fund losses (other than foreign investment fund losses calculated under the branch equivalent method) have been repealed. If a taxpayer has a ring-fenced foreign investment fund loss from the 2006-07 or an earlier income year that has previously not been used, it will become deductible in 2007-08 as foreign investment fund losses are no longer ring-fenced (other than those arising under the branch equivalent method). Currency conversion rules The rules for converting amounts from foreign currency into New Zealand currency have been standardised for all foreign investment fund calculation methods (other than the branch equivalent method which has separate currency conversion rules). For the fair dividend rate, cost, comparative value and deemed rate of return methods, investors have two options for performing exchange rate conversions: • conversion using the exchange rate on the day for which market value is determined or on which each amount is derived or incurred; or • conversion at the average of the close of trading spot exchange rates for the fifteenth day of each month that falls in the year. For a person using the accounting profits method, the person must choose for all the calculations of the net after-tax accounting profits to be in: • the currency of the foreign investment fund’s accounts, with the result then converted at the average of the close of trading spot exchange rates for the fifteenth day of each complete month that falls in the accounting period; or • New Zealand currency. Having chosen a currency conversion method for an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund, a person must use the same method for that interest in subsequent income years. Therefore, it will no longer be possible to change currency conversion methods from year to year for the same attributing interests. A person is also required to use the same currency conversion method for all attributing interests for which they use the same foreign investment fund calculation method. For example, if a person chooses to use only the fair dividend rate method for their offshore portfolio share investments they must use the same currency conversion method – the actual (spot) exchange rates or an annual average rate – for all those investments. These changes, which require consistency in the use of currency conversion methods, are intended to prevent taxpayers changing their currency conversion method in order to reduce their income tax liabilities. 25 Restrictions on choice of calculation methods Subject to certain restrictions, anyone with attributing interests in foreign investment funds may choose to use any of the six methods of calculating foreign investment fund income or loss – fair dividend rate, cost, accounting profits, branch equivalent, comparative value and deemed rate of return – by completing their return of income accordingly (section EX 38). The rules dealing with the restrictions on choosing the particular calculation methods have been amended to incorporate the new fair dividend rate and cost methods. Restrictions on using the fair dividend rate method (sections EX 40(7), (8) and (9), and EX 40B and section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994) The fair dividend rate method may generally only be used for interests of less than 10 percent in foreign companies (section EX 40(7)(b)). In determining whether a person’s shareholding in a foreign company is less than 10 percent they are treated as holding any interests held by associated persons. This rule prevents persons holding 10 percent or more interests in foreign companies disaggregating their interests amongst associated persons to inappropriately access the fair dividend rate method. The requirement that a person’s interest in a foreign company must be less than 10 percent must be met at all times during the income year if the foreign company is not a grey list company. However, if the foreign company is a grey list company (that is, a company resident in Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States) the requirement has only to be met at one point in time in the income year. The reason for this lesser restriction for investments in grey list companies is to allow a person to continue to use the fair dividend rate method for the year they are increasing their interest in a grey list company from less than 10 percent to 10 percent or more instead of requiring them to use the comparative value method for that transitional year before they become entitled to the exemption from the foreign investment fund rules for 10 percent or more interests in grey list companies. An exception to this less than 10 percent rule is that a portfolio investment entity, an entity eligible to be a portfolio investment entity (such as a superannuation fund that does not elect) or a life insurance company can use the fair dividend rate method for any level of interest they hold in a foreign investment vehicle. This is generally defined as a non-resident collective investment vehicle that meets the requirements in section HL 5. Because of the widely held nature of these investing entities, investments by these entities can be regarded as being in-substance portfolio investments and therefore should be entitled to have the fair dividend rate method apply to them (section EX 40(7)(a)). A person is allowed to use the fair dividend rate method for an attributing interest for an income year only if the person does not use the comparative value method for any other attributing interest that is a share in a foreign company and for which the person would be allowed to use the fair dividend rate method – for example, it is a less than 26 10 percent interest (section EX 40(8)(b)). This requirement provides the mechanism which prevents persons (including individuals and family trusts) from selectively using the fair dividend rate method for their shares to produce a total return (dividends and capital gains) of over 5 percent (thereby gaining advantage of the 5 percent cap under that method) and using the comparative value method for their shares to produce a total return of less than 5 percent (which would tax that lesser amount). Therefore, individuals and family trusts must choose between using either the fair dividend rate method or the comparative value method for all their less than 10 percent shareholdings in foreign companies and cannot “cherry pick” between these methods. In other words, investors must take a portfolio approach to applying the fair dividend rate or comparative value methods. The fair dividend rate method does not apply to certain offshore portfolio share investments which effectively offer New Zealand investors “guaranteed returns”. These investments are more akin to debt investments than equity investments and it is New Zealand’s policy to tax debt investments in full. For example, a portfolio investment in a company resident in a low-tax jurisdiction that invests in high-yield debt or other guaranteed return instruments would be taxable on a maximum return of 5 percent under the fair dividend rate whereas if they had invested directly in these instruments they would be taxable on the full return. There are five types of investments of a “guaranteed return” nature that do not qualify for the fair dividend rate method (sections EX 40(8)(a)(i) to (v)) and EX 40(9)): 1. Fixed rate share investments in foreign companies (a “fixed-rate share” is defined in section LF 2(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004). 2. Non-participating redeemable share investments in foreign companies (a “non- participating redeemable share” is defined in section CD 14(9) of the Income Tax Act 2004). 3. Investments which involve an effectively non-contingent obligation, directly or through an arrangement, to return an amount to the investor that exceeds the issue price of the investment. The Commissioner has a discretion under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make a determination that an investment that is caught by this non-contingent obligation restriction but is not substantially debt in nature, still qualifies for the fair dividend rate method. 4. The Commissioner has the discretion to make a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that an investment that is not excluded from the fair dividend rate method by the above restrictions, but is still substantially debt in nature, does not qualify for the fair dividend rate method. 5. Investments in non-resident entities whose assets comprise 80% or more New Zealand dollar denominated financial arrangements (debt instruments) also do not qualify for the fair dividend rate method. This is necessary, as the rule in category 3 above may not be effective in instances when the investment is in a foreign bond fund that invests back into New Zealand government debt. This is because the obligation to provide a return in excess of the issue price would apply to the foreign fund holding the New Zealand debt, not between the New Zealand investor and the fund. 27 The principle underlying the Commissioner’s making of a determination precluding use of the fair dividend rate method is that the method should not apply to investments in foreign entities that provide investors with a return similar to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt instrument. The determination process is intended to prevent investments that may otherwise be marketed as a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment being held through an offshore entity to take advantage of the fair dividend rate method. For the purposes of making a determination described under category 4 the criteria that the Commissioner will consider will include: • The proportion of the foreign entity’s assets that comprise debt or other fixed return instruments (such as fixed rate shares). • The extent to which the entity’s investments comprising debt or other fixed rate instruments are denominated in New Zealand currency. • In relation to investments of the entity that are not denominated in New Zealand currency, the extent to which the exchange rate risk has been removed by swaps, forward currency contracts or other derivatives. The Commissioner will take into account the whole arrangement, including any interposed entities or financial arrangements, in ascertaining whether the investment in a foreign entity provides investors with a return similar to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt instrument. The degree of credit risk of the entity’s debt investments is not a relevant factor in the determination process. In making any determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Commissioner will take into account the economic relationships created by the whole arrangement and the principle that the fair dividend rate method should only be used for an in-substance equity investment where the investor has an interest in the business profits and losses of a foreign entity. This determination process is intended to provide sufficient flexibility to deal with cases close to the boundary. Determinations apply on a prospective basis only, unless the taxpayer would, in the absence of the determination, be subject to a shortfall penalty in respect of the investment that is affected by the determination. For investments in place before 18 December 2006 (date of enactment of the new offshore tax rules), the Commissioner will apply any determination from the start of the tax year beginning after the making of the determination. This will also be the general rule for other investments except for those investments designed to circumvent the restrictions on the use of the fair dividend rate method; determinations for these investments may apply from the date they are made. The Australian “economic substance” test for determining whether an instrument is debt or equity provides guidance for determining whether an investment involves an effectively non-contingent obligation to return an amount to the investor that exceeds the issue price of the investment (as in category 3 above) and therefore should not have the fair dividend rate method applied to it, because the investment is essentially 28 debt. Contingencies that are immaterially remote are ignored for the purposes of this rule. Guidelines issued by the Australian Tax Office provide guidance on understanding what an “immaterially remote contingency” is. A person who is not allowed to use the fair dividend rate method for an attributing interest because it comes within one of the five categories of “guaranteed return” investments must use the comparative value method for that interest, or the deemed rate of return method if the comparative value method is not practical because the person cannot obtain the opening market value for the interest (section EX 40B). Deemed rate of return method (section EX 40(5)) A person may not use the deemed rate of return method for an attributing interest if the interest is a less than 10 percent shareholding in a foreign company and the person is not required to use the deemed rate of return method for the interest under section EX 40B (because it is “guaranteed return” form of investment). Comparative value method (section EX 40(6)) A person may use the comparative value method for an attributing interest that is a share in a foreign company only if: • the interest is 10 percent or more at any time in the income year (for this purpose, a person’s interests are increased by any interest held by associated persons); or • the interest is a “guaranteed return” form of investment referred to in section EX 40(8)(a) for which the comparative value method or deemed rate of return method must be used under section EX 40B; or • the person is a natural person or a family trust (defined as a qualifying trust established mainly for the benefit of natural persons related to the settlor or charities and which has no settlor who is not a natural person; the trust must also not be a superannuation scheme). The main purpose of these restrictions is to prevent persons other than individuals or family trusts from using the comparative value method for less than 10 percent shareholdings in foreign companies and thereby potentially “cherry pick” between the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods by changing their investments between years. The restriction is also consistent with the fair dividend rate method being the primary calculation method for less than 10% interests in foreign companies. Cost method (section EX 40(10)) The cost method is the back-up method to the fair dividend rate method and is designed to cater for less than 10 percent interests in foreign companies for which use of the fair dividend rate method is allowed. For example, it is not a “guaranteed return” form of investment but is not practical because the investor cannot determine the opening market value of the interest except by an independent valuation. An example of where the cost method may be used would be investments in unlisted 29 foreign companies. This method is therefore intended to cater for offshore portfolio investments for which market values are not readily available. Default calculation method (section EX 41) The rules which allocate a default calculation method in situations when a person does not choose a particular calculation method for an attributing interest (as required under section EX 38(2)) and the foreign investment fund rules do not have the effect of requiring a particular method to be used, have been amended to cater for the new fair dividend rate and cost methods. The default calculation method for less than 10 percent interests in foreign companies for which use of the fair dividend rate method is allowed (for example, the interest is not a “guaranteed return” form of investment) is the fair dividend rate method if it is practical to use that method. If it is not practical to use that method for such interests the default calculation method is the cost method. In practice, the default calculation method rules give the Commissioner a basis for assessing an investor’s income if no tax return is filed. Restrictions on change of calculation method (section EX 50) The general rule in EX 50(1) is that once a person uses a particular calculation method for an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund they must continue to use the same method for the interest in subsequent periods unless they are allowed a change of method under the other provisions of section EX 50. The rules in section EX 50 allowing calculation methods to be changed have been amended to allow natural persons and family trusts to change as many times as they choose between the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods (section EX 50(8)). A family trust is defined as a qualifying trust established mainly for the benefit of natural persons related to the settlor or charities and which has no settlor who is not a natural person. The trust must also not be a superannuation scheme. This ability to switch freely between the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods provides the mechanism for individuals and family trusts to pay tax on an amount lower than 5 percent of opening value under the fair dividend rate method if the total return on the investment, as calculated under the comparative value method, produces a lower amount. A person may change from the fair dividend rate method if it is not practical to continue with that method because it is impossible to determine the start-of-year market value of the interest except by an independent valuation (section EX 50(2)(f)). It is also possible to change from the cost method if that method was the default method under section EX 41 (which is the method a person must use for an attributing interest if they failed to choose a calculation method for the interest) and it ceases to be the default method under that provision (for example, if start-of-year market values become available so the fair dividend rate method becomes the default method). 30 Consequences of change of calculation methods (section EX 51) The rules dealing with the consequences of changing calculation methods (if the change allowed under the other foreign investment fund provisions) have been amended to cater for the new fair dividend rate and cost methods. When changing from the fair dividend rate or cost methods to the branch equivalent or accounting profits methods, or vice versa, there is a deemed disposal and reacquisition of the interest at market value at the start of the foreign investment fund accounting period to which the new method applies (section EX 51(1) and (2)). When changing from the fair dividend rate method to the cost method there is a deemed disposal and reacquisition of the interest at market value at the start of the income year to which the new method applies. The opening value for the purposes of the cost method will be this market value (section EX 51(3)). When changing from the cost method to the fair dividend rate or comparative value methods there is a deemed disposal and reacquisition of the interest at the start of the income year to which the new method applies at what would have been the opening value for the year under the cost method. This value will also be the opening value for the purposes of the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods (section EX 51(4)). Entry into and exit from foreign investment fund rules (sections EX 52, EX 53 and GD 14) The rules dealing with circumstances in which a person enters into or exits from the foreign investment fund rules have been amended to cater for the new fair dividend rate and cost methods. When a person using the fair dividend rate or cost methods for an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund ceases to be resident in New Zealand they are deemed to have disposed of the interest at its market value at the time immediately before they cease to be a New Zealand resident (section EX 52(1) and (2)). When a person becomes a resident of New Zealand and uses the fair dividend rate or cost methods for an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for the period after the change of residence, they are deemed to have acquired the interest at its market value at the time of the change of residence (section EX 52(3) and (4)). When a person holds property which becomes an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund because an exemption in sections EX 32 to EX 37 ceases to apply (or the NZ$50,000 minimum threshold is exceeded) there is a deemed disposition and reacquisition at market value of the property at the time of its change in status if the person uses the fair dividend rate or cost methods for the interest (section EX 53(1) and (2)). When a person holds property which ceases to be an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund because an exemption in sections EX 32 to EX 37 starts to apply (or the person falls below the NZ$50,000 minimum threshold), there is a deemed disposition and reacquisition of the interest at market value at the time of its change in 31 status if the person used the fair dividend rate or cost methods for the interest before the change (section EX 53(5) and (6)). When a person using the fair dividend rate or cost methods for an attributing interest disposes of the interest for nil or inadequate consideration they are deemed to have disposed of the interest at its market value at the time (section GD 14(1) and (2)). When a person acquires an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for consideration that is not equal to the interest’s market value, and they use the fair dividend rate or cost methods for the interest, they are deemed to have acquired the interest at its market value at the time (section GD 14(3) and (4)). Transitional rules: values at which offshore interests enter the new rules (section EX 54B) All investments which become subject for the first time to the new foreign investment fund rules enter the new rules at their market value on the start date of the new tax rules. For most individuals this will be 1 April 2007. This entry into the new rules at market value is achieved under section EX 54B(2) by a deemed disposition and reacquisition of the interests at their market value on the start date of the new foreign investment fund rules for the investor. This deemed disposition and reacquisition applies only for transitional purposes and, in particular, it does not set a new cost basis for the purposes of the $50,000 minimum threshold for application of the foreign investment fund rules in sections CQ 5 and DN 6. The original cost basis applies for the purposes of the NZ$50,000 threshold. A person who holds their investments on revenue account, such as a managed fund, and which becomes subject to the new foreign investment fund rules may have a resultant tax liability because of the deemed disposition and reacquisition under section EX 54B(2). This liability can spread over three years beginning with the first year of application of the new foreign investment fund rules. At least one-third of this tax liability must be paid in the first year, half of the balance paid in the second year and the remaining balance paid in the third year (section EX 54B(3)(a)). A person who has a tax liability because of the deemed disposition and reacquisition under section EX 54B is not liable to pay any penalty or interest for an inaccuracy in an estimate, or shortfall in the payment, of provisional tax if the inaccuracy or shortfall arises because of the deemed disposal (section EX 54B(3)(b)).
AN OVERVIEW OF HOW THE NEW OFFSHORE INVESTMENT TAX RULES APPLY TO INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILY TRUSTS New tax rules applying to less than 10 percent shareholdings in foreign companies have recently been enacted. For people who have a standard income year (the large majority), the new rules apply from the start of their 2007–08 income year on 1 April 2007. Do the new rules apply to you? Investments in Australian-resident and listed companies are generally exempt from the new rules. These investments will continue to be taxable as they are currently. This means for most people, who hold their shares on capital account, they are taxable only on dividends. Generally, you will be entitled to this exemption if you receive a dividend carrying Australian franking credits from a company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange All Ordinaries index (the 500 largest listed companies). The new rules also do not apply to you if the total cost of your offshore shares (not counting shares in Australian-resident listed companies) is NZ$50,000 or less. You will continue to pay tax only on dividends if you hold your shares on capital account. It is important to know that this $50,000 rule is a threshold rather than an exemption and does not generally apply to family trusts. Therefore, if the cost of your offshore shares exceeds $50,000 they are all subject to the new rules and not just the excess costing more than $50,000. Other points about this rule are:  It is the original cost of your shares rather than their current market value that is relevant for this threshold. However, you may choose to treat shares acquired before 2000 as costing half their market value on 1 April 2007.  The exchange rate on the date of your purchase of any shares in foreign currency should be used.  The $50,000 threshold takes into account brokerage fees if these are part of the cost of acquiring any shares.  A couple can qualify for a total NZ$100,000 threshold. This can be achieved by half of the shares costing $100,000 being held in each person’s name, the shares being wholly jointly owned, or a combination of individual and joint ownership (each person would have to add half the cost of their jointly owned shares to their individual shares to find out if they qualify for the threshold). New fair dividend rate method If the new rules apply to you, you will be taxed each year under the new fair dividend rate method on a maximum of 5 percent of the opening market value of your offshore shares. If the total gain (dividends and capital gains) on your offshore share portfolio is less than 5 percent then tax is payable on the lower amount with no tax payable if the shares make a loss. Other key features are:  Dividends are not taxed; however, foreign withholding tax deducted from dividends is still available as a foreign tax credit.  All your offshore shares that are subject to the new rules are taken into account in determining whether your total gain is less than 5 percent (that is, a pooled approach is taken).  Generally only shares held at the start of an income year are taken into account and therefore purchases and sales of shares during a year are ignored. However, shares that are bought and sold in the same year are taxed under the new rules.  No losses are carried over under the new method – each year is treated separately. Examples If you make a total return of more than 5 percent John holds offshore shares that have a market value of $100,000 at the start of the year. These shares are worth $115,000 at the end of the year. John also receives a $10,000 dividend. Under the fair dividend rate method, John pays tax on 5 percent of $100,000 or a lower amount if his return for the year is less than 5 percent. No tax is payable if his shares make a loss. John's total return for the year is the $15,000 capital gain on his shares and the dividend of $10,000. His total return is therefore $25,000. However, his taxable income for the year is limited to 5 percent of the opening value of his shares. This would result in taxable income of $5,000. If you make a total return of less than 5 percent Mary also holds offshore shares that have a market value of $100,000 at the start of the year. These shares increase in value to $102,000 at the end of the year. Mary also receives a $1,000 dividend. Mary would pay tax on 5 percent of $100,000 (her opening value) unless she can show that she made a return of less than this. Mary's total return for the year is $3,000 (comprising a capital gain of $2,000 and a dividend of $1,000), which is less than 5 percent of her opening value of $100,000. Therefore, Mary is only taxed on $3,000. If you make a loss Judy holds offshore shares that have a market value of $100,000 at the start of the year, which decrease in value to $75,000 at the end of the year. She also receives a $10,000 dividend. Judy would be taxable on 5 percent of the opening value of her shares unless she can show that her total return for the year is less than 5 percent. Judy's total return for the year comprises a capital loss of $25,000 and the dividend of $10,000. Her net return is therefore a loss of $15,000. Because Judy has made a loss on her offshore shares, no tax is payable.
