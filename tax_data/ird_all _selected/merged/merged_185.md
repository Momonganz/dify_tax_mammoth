Orders setting aside dispositions of property made under section 348 of the Property Law Act 2007
=================================================================================================

2012 case note - dispositions of property – insolvency - prejudice to the CIR as a creditor.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Ly & Ors

Legislative References

Property Law Act 2007

### Summary

The properties were disposed of without a reasonably equivalent value being received in exchange and as a consequence the debtors became insolvent. The dispositions were also made with the intent to prejudice the Commissioner of Inland Revenue as a creditor, and had the effect of hindering or delaying the Commissioner's recourse to those properties to satisfy the debt.

### Facts

Hon and Ta Ly purchased a residential property in Taumaranui ("the Miriama St property") and a bakery business in Taumaranui ("the Taumaranui Bakery") in 1999. The Taumaranui Bakery was operated by the Hon and Ta Ly partnership.

In 2003, they also purchased a bakery business in Whakatane ("the Whakatane Bakery"). This business was operated by Hon Ly as a sole trader. Hon and Ta Ly also purchased a residential property in Auckland in April 2003 ("the Sunset Rd property") by way of loan assistance from friends and a mortgage from BNZ.

In 2006, Hon and Ta Ly, as trustees of the Hon and Ta Ly Family Trust, purchased the building from which the Taumaranui Bakery business was conducted ("the Hakiaha St building") with funding from The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Ltd.

The Commissioner initiated an audit of both businesses in July 2008. As a consequence of that audit, assessments for PAYE, GST, Working for Families Tax Credits and income tax were made against Hon and Ta Ly. These assessments were not challenged by either Hon Ly or Ta Ly and constituted a debt owed to the Commissioner.

On 16 April 2009, Vandra Ly (Hon and Ta Ly's daughter) purchased the Miriama St and Sunset Rd properties for $120,000 and $430,000 respectively with a $50,000 deposit apportioned as $25,000 for each property. The balance owed for the Miriama St property was left owing to Hon and Ta Ly under an unsecured term loan and the balance for the Sunset Rd property was met partly by mortgage funding and the rest by an unsecured term loan from Hon and Ta Ly. No payments were made towards the term loans.

On 21 April 2009 both the Taumaranui Bakery and the Whakatane Bakery were sold to Vandra Ly Limited (a company established by Vandra Ly) for $35,000 and $113,000 respectively by way of a further term loan agreement. Both businesses were subsequently sold to unrelated third parties in 2010.

On 9 June 2009, Vandra Ly sold the Miriama St property to herself and Thiary Ly (Vandra Ly's sister) as trustees of the Vandra Ly Family Trust for $100,000. The Sunset Rd property was also transferred to the Vandra Ly Family Trust (the transfer was registered on 23 December 2010). Hon and Ta Ly remained in residence pursuant to an agreement to pay rent. However, no rent was paid.

On 10 June 2011, the Commissioner issued proceedings seeking judgment for the debt owed. The Commissioner also sought orders under section 348 of the Property Law Act 2007 ("PLA") in respect of the Miriama St and Sunset Rd properties on the basis these dispositions had prejudiced the Commissioner as creditor. Further, the Commissioner sought freezing orders in respect of those properties and the additional Hakiaha St building.

Freezing orders were granted albeit the Sunset Rd property was sold on 4 December 2011 (with the proceeds held by the Registrar of the High Court pending judgment).

### Issues

The issues were whether:

*   the dispositions were made with the intent to prejudice a creditor (section 346(1)(b) of the PLA);
*   the dispositions did prejudice the Commissioner as creditor (section 348(1)(b) of the PLA);
*   the respondents had made out any of the defences set out in section 349 of the PLA; and
*   any further orders (compensation for Vandra Ly) could be made under section 350(3) of the PLA.

### Decision

Andrews J stated there was no dispute that the transfers were dispositions (section 345(2) of the PLA) and that Hon and Ta Ly became insolvent as a consequence of those dispositions (section 346(2) of the PLA).

Her Honour was guided by the Supreme Court judgment in _Regal Castings Ltd v Lightbody_ \[2008\] NZSC 87; \[2009\] 2 NZLR 433 and on the basis of a number of factors (in particular the fact only $50,000 had ever been paid for the properties, no rent had been paid by Hon and Ta Ly, the debt had been forgiven to the extent possible and the Commissioner had not been advised of the transfers) Andrews J considered the transfers were made without a reasonably equivalent value being received in exchange.

Andrews J also considered that the transfers were made with the intent to prejudice the Commissioner as creditor, particularly as Vandra Ly confirmed she was aware Hon and Ta Ly owed the Commissioner a substantial debt and that she wanted to preserve their assets and further that Hon and Ta Ly knew that by transferring the Miriama St and Sunset Rd properties they removed themselves from any ability to pay the debt. Her Honour was satisfied the transfers had the effect of hindering or delaying the Commissioner's recourse to those properties to satisfy the debt and therefore exposed the Commissioner to a significantly enhanced risk of not recovering the debt. Accordingly, Andrews J considered the transfers fell within subpart 6 of the PLA and therefore could consider whether orders should be made under section 348.

Despite counsel for the respondents submitting during the hearing there was no prejudice to the Commissioner as Vandra Ly could pay the outstanding loan balances, Andrews J did not accept there could be no prejudice to the Commissioner. Her Honour considered that the Commissioner had been hindered or delayed in the exercise of his right of recourse to the properties as he has had to apply for orders under section 348 and incur costs and delay in doing so.

Her Honour also considered that the available defences under section 349 of the PLA had not been made out by the respondents particularly given valuable consideration was not given for the properties and that Vandra Ly had knowledge of the fact these were dispositions to which subpart 6 of the PLA would apply.

While the respondents had sought an order for compensation to Vandra Ly for payments she has made to assist her parents, rent payable for the period her parents resided in the Sunset Rd property and the benefit of the increase in value of the Sunset Rd property since its transfer to Vandra Ly, Andrews J did not consider it appropriate that Vandra Ly benefit from retaining the properties.

This is developed as part of the high level design phase of the Business Transformation Programme. •This blueprint is directed by IR’s strategies, industry research and futuristic thinking by the Executive Leadership Team (ELT). •This blueprint has five parts that together create a complete picture of IR’s future organisation: (a) definition of the ‘targetstate’, (b) guiding principles for the organisation design process, (c) the six organisation shifts, (d) the ten key design decisions, and (e) the conceptual organisation model that emerges by 2023. Why is this Organisation Design Blueprint important? •This blueprint articulates the future state organisation as a modern revenue agency and world-class public service for New Zealand. •This blueprint will serve as a ‘north star’ to guide but not prescribe how the organisation will transform over the next 8 years. The organisation will be expected to transform through multiple transition states to achieve the future state by 2023. Hence, this blueprint mayevolve as the organisation transitions and responds to environment changes. How did we get here? •This has been an ELT led and CIR sponsored design that commenced in February 2015 with the assessment of IR strategies, industryresearch and robust ELT discussion. •Using those insights, the target state definition and organisation design principles were completed and endorsed in March 2015. •From that, 10 key design decisions and 6 shifts were developed through a series of ELT interactive workshops and discussions.These were endorsed in June 2015. •The 10 key design decisions were then translated into a conceptual model that describes the future state organisation in ninedifferent ‘chapters’. The conceptual model tells an important multifaceted story wherein IR will truly transform when all aspects of the organisation are holistically considered–it is not just about structures and accountabilities, it is also about the right outcomes, people capabilities, workforce management, culture, leadership, governance and geographic considerations. The conceptual model was refined through ‘open house’ sessions with ELT and their leadership teams at the end of June 2015. Context: Document Background IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Business Transformation Future State Organisation Design Blueprint What will happen next? On 12 August, the Strategy Governance Board endorsed three (3) points and noted three (3) points below: 1.Completion of the Future State Organisation Design Blueprint as a part of high level design. Endorsement is for its five (5) component parts –see slide 4 ▪Definition of the target state ▪The 20 guiding principles for the organisation design process ▪The 6 organisation shifts ▪The 10 key design decisions ▪The conceptual organisation model that emerges by 2023 (the nine chapters) 2.To move to the Detailed design of Transition State 1 which will include ‘Must dos’ activities to support Stage 1 ▪Detailed Job/Role (JE) and team design to support the adoption of the Stage 1 releases and solutions. This work will be the bottom up design that contribute towards the future state organisation. ▪Design of the TS&O/ICT support structure and jobs required by the end of Stage 1 ▪Proceed with further design and rollout of the future state Culture Plan ▪Proceed with further design and rollout of the Leadership plan Build organisation foundations for Transition States 1-4 ▪Construct for future state job architecture ▪Commence review and recommendations for future core workforce management components, mainly performance management, talent management. This scope requires further discussion with P&C and the ESS team. 3.To come back in mid November 2015 apply a set of decision criteria to determine KDD and organisational capability candidates for Transition State 1 Armed with a better understanding of the Stage 1 change landscape, the ELT will come back and apply a set of decision criteria to determine KDD and organisational capability candidates for further design and implementation in Transition State 1. In the interim, the detailed organisation design will remain responsive as necessary to changes proposed to IR’s strategic direction, enterprise-level strategies, updating of the TOM and any refresh of IR4TF. In addition, the SGB is being asked to note that: ▪The CIR will continue to sponsor the detailed organisation design process which will continue to be governed by the ODC and SGB. ▪All BAU organisation changes are tabled to ODC for alignment to the Organisation Design Blueprint and for ODCT to provide recommendations to ELT/SGB. ▪The Organisation Design Blueprint will be communicated to Tier 3 leaders.

Current state assessmentFuture state direction Legend:{ } Sample leading organisations based on observed organisation practices 7 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Business Transformation Future State Organisation Design Blueprint The ELT then agreed on 20 design principles that will guide how the organisation needs to be designed in order to achieve the target state across customer experience, organisation efficiency and effectiveness, agility and intelligence and the workforce. Organisation Design Principles and Objectives Category 2: Efficiency and effectiveness 6.Structures are configured to enable non-core capabilities to leverage third party innovation and expertise that will enhance supply chain efficiency, effectiveness and customer experience. 7.Core capabilities that direct overall design and integration of the ecosystem is retained in IR in order to deliver on its accountabilities. 8.Continuous improvement is embedded in the way we work, consistently increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of all services delivered. Category 1: The customer 1.Structures and ways of working will be designed to enable, manage and champion the customer experience of the future that will facilitate customer compliance from the start. 2.Organisation will structure to keep pace with evolving channels, technologies, shifting customer needs, including customer lifecycle services. 3.Customer-facing (external and internal) parts of the organisation will be enabled by more customer-centric ways of working with customer metrics used as measures of performance. 4.IR’s services will be accessible through multiple channels and methods, including digital, mobile workforce, and collaboration with other government agencies and intermediaries. 5.Proactive customer assistance is enabled by devolving decision making closer to front line who interact directly with customers. Category 3: Agility and intelligence 9.Policy agility is enabled by agile structure, adaptable technology, process flexibility and skilled decision making. 10.Structures and organisational processes improve information sharing and enhance relationships with government, as well as enableall-of-government federated service delivery. 11.Effective decision making through clear decision accountabilities and streamlined governance processes that focus on decisionoutcomes and speed to value rather than bureaucracy (internal and external). 12.Rapid and devolved risk-based decision making enabled through readily available information, analysis and value-based frameworks. 13.Decision makers consider the organisation beyond own functional area, taking an IR-wide and outcome-focused approach. 14.Innovation is enabled by removing structural barriers (avoiding a deep hierarchy and siloed functions) and through collaborativework practices. Category 4: The workforce 15.Intellectual property associated with our core capabilities and specialist knowledge workers is protected, retained and institutionalised. 16.Individual jobs are designed for meaningful work, motivated by congruent reward and support arrangements that deliver a strong employee value proposition. 17.Individual performance measures have a direct line of sight to the organisational performance and score card measures. 18.Multi-disciplinary, problem solving and knowledge based teams that are flexible and adaptive to meet business needs. 19.Formal and informal mechanisms to connect the organisation internally and externally, creating an environment that fosters collaboration and thought leadership. 20.Span of control and layers of management are optimised and adaptable to promote speed and accuracy of decision making. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Business Transformation Future State Organisation Design Blueprint Guided by the design principles, the ELT set out the 6 essential shifts that the organisation will need to make in order to modernise IR as a revenue agency and create a world-class public service for New Zealand. 1 Pro-active and customer- centric organisation 5 Alliances & partnerships across government and private sector 6 Motivated diverse workforce operating as ‘one IR’ 2 Information harnessed and intelligence-led 4 Elevated organisation and policy agility through innovation and change 3 Effective and efficient business working in multiple modes IR Future State Organisation IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Business Transformation Future State Organisation Design Blueprint The six shifts will shape IR to be a fundamentally different organisation. These shifts are anchored on the 10 key design decisions made by the ELT. 1 Pro-active and customer centric organisation #1 We will increasingly provide proactive customer assistance that is relevant to the customer lifecycle. We will be better at influencing customer compliance behaviour through rapid problem solving, greater use of insight and more empowered staff. #2 We will adopt a customer centric organisation model and establish clearer accountabilities to manage customers. We will integrate end-to-end services and have more focused delivery to influence customer compliance. 2 Information harnessed and intelligence- led #3 We will consolidate information across the organisation and embed insight in the business. We will drive the sharing of information and use of intelligence to support effective decision making to meet IR’s accountabilities. 3 Effective and efficient business working in multiple modes #4 We will direct and design the revenue system and leverage delivery of processes by partners to improveIR’s effectiveness and efficiency. We will drive value to government while protecting the integrity of the system. #5 We will consolidate and streamline the delivery of business services to increase the value to IR, our customers and the government. #6 We will manage strategic and advisory services more holisticallyto better direct IR’s strategy and steer the organisation towards achieving an IR for the future. 4 Elevated organisation and policy agility through innovation and change #7 We will elevate organisation and policy agility through integrated design and implementation of policy, change and innovation. We will better collaborate with industry, government and NGOs, to increase our ability to respond to environmental changes and quickly realise value. 5 Alliances and partnerships across government and private sector #8 We will build stronger alliance and partnership management capability to support the fostering of relationships with private, intra/inter government and non- government sectors. We will achieve greater value of services through our partnerships. 6 Motivated diverse workforce operating as ‘one IR’ #9 Our future workforce will shift to be more knowledge based. Our people will be equipped with business acumen, more focused on problem solving and less on transactional processes. We will be a smaller future organisation with higher skills. #10We will motivate and enable the future workforce through enhanced workforce management. We will modernise our performance management, have more relevant employee value, a renewed organisation culture and inspiring leadership.

Workforce management practices will need to be enhanced and holistic, connected with culture and leadership and powered by analytics. We will combine workforce forecasting data with insights about how our workforce are performing and feeling about their work environment to make adjustments to our leadership, talent management and engagement programmes. We will actively manage our pipelines, which will include internal career development, partnerships with other agencies, and relationships with education and training organisations. We will have well-known and distinct value propositions across the major capability markets we need access to. This will enable differentiation of employment arrangements, recognition and reward approaches and career pathways. IR will be recognised as an important ‘career-building’ step for a number of specialist capability streams. As a people leader, I make weekly decisions about deployment of people, and to forecast where, when and how I access supplementary talent. I use every discussion with my people to look at how they are performing, how their behaviour is contributing to IR’s culture and brand, and how we are supporting them to meet their aspirations. IR will have a variety of partner arrangements with other organisations, within NZ and internationally, to support the supply and exchange of capabilities depending on our reciprocal needs. We will use these partner arrangements to access capability where our need for it is short-term or variable, or where the costs of accessing the level of talent we need are above our remuneration and reward levels. I first came to work at IR through a secondment from another government agency as part of a cross-agency career development pathway. After having children I went on to become a contractor so I could shape my working hours around my childcare commitments while retaining my specialist knowledge. Over the last year I have had 3 assignments with IR as a technical tax expert. IR values me as a specialist in my field and my role includes leading and participating in problem-based teams, and co-ordinating an active community of practice with members from within IR and across partner agencies. Through our extensive partnering arrangements and flexible employment arrangements, we will be able to increase and decrease the supply of capability based on business need. Roles in IR will be clustered by capability, defined as a mix of skills, knowledge, experience and aptitudes. People will be flexibly deployed through assignments on the basis of business need –through a mix of cohort-based and problem- specific teams that will enable them to maximise their ability to contribute. There will be different expectations on performance depending on assignment objectives, and how people’s behaviours are embodying IR’s culture.

In the future, IR will interact with customers primarily through digital channels. This will require less physical contact and site locations. Community and customer interactions will not always require a physical presence and there will be a different approach to ensuring community presence. Access totalent, centres of excellence and economies of scale will be the drivers behind establishing physical locations. Geography and organisation considerations in detailed design will be used to determine IR’s future footprint for 2023. The below geography considerations tool has been developed to assist with such decisions. Key Design Decisions for Detailed Design The KDDs will be formed using a decision tool that considers four perspectives: Customer/Stakehol der Centralisation Access to talent Location Customer Services –Individual & Families and Businesses & Organisations Information& Intelligence ServicesStrategy& Advisory ServicesPolicy, Innovation & Change ServicesBusiness Services Geography Implications •Non-location specific. •Centralise for economiesof scale. •Visible community presence required to influence compliance. •Access to talent and specialists. •Centralise for centres of expertise. •Location specific(most likely Wellington) for some functions. •Centres of expertise for technical and specialist functions. •Access to talentand resources. •Location specific, Wellington for some functions (eg, Policy). •Centralise for centres of expertise. •Centralise for economies of scale. •Centralise for centres of expertise. •Access to talent and resources. •Opportunities to leverage other parties. Where IR will be and where work will be done, will be based on (a) how we will interact with customers, (b) how our business will stay responsive, (c) how we will access the required people capabilities and (d) organisational considerations like cost, leadership and presence. 18 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Business Transformation C Future State Organisation Design Blueprint The future ways of work will be different and anchored on being customer centric, intelligence led and agile. These anchors will be embedded through a cultural model to change how we behave, how we make decisions and what is important to the organisation. Agile “We really get how 80/20 works at IR. I am part of a team that knows how to do the right thing to meet competing needs of customers, IR and the system and how to do that at pace. Our work place makes it easy to be flexible, valuing people whether they are staff or third party providers.” Customer centric “Our customers matter to us. Whether they are internal or external, the customer experience is at the heart of everything I do. In my job it is easy for me to make a difference for customers. Our policies and processes enable us to do our best.” Intelligence led “In my job it is easy for me to get things done. I have access to great systems and data, and I have the authority to make decisions. I can trust the quality of the information we use to do my best for IR and our customers, and I am supported to make those decisions.“ “My leader trusts and supports me to make the right decisions needed for customers and for IR. It’s clear what I am accountable for and the impact my decisions make.” Whole of IR, Outcomes Oriented and Risk Tolerantwill guide how we ensure decisions are made at lower levels and how we develop the policies, processes and systems we use to get our outcomes achieved. “How we are rewarded and recognised here makes it clear that behaving according to our culture and values is non-negotiable. I truly collaborate with others, as their input shapes a better outcome for us and our customers.” People Oriented, Empoweredand Collaborative will be how we describe how we behave towards each other internally and externally. Trust and IR values will be visible throughout IR and leaders build trust. Anchored in ... Experienced through ... Shaped by ... Leadership will provide clarity on the future direction, and role model culture every day. Enabling Infrastructures will be the critical decision making authorities, governance processes and systems that will be used. People Programmes will be the performance and reward practices that reinforce culture-aligned behaviours at all levels. Our Culture is ... “I know what makes IR special, it’s that we constantly innovate and improve to make sure we do our best, so our customers get the best tax authority in the world”. Partnering with Customers and Innovative will be the primary ways we describe culturally what is important to our business vision and mission and how we structure our operations. Measured and monitored regularly 19 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Business Transformation Future State Organisation Design Blueprint Leaders will be critical in achieving the target state. The future will see leadership exist in many ways and across all areas of IR. We will have people, technical, system and thought leaders. All IR leaders live and model the IR Culture & Values. Leadership will be a critical enabler of our future culture state. •Good leaders will be found everywhere in IR and will positively influence the behaviour of others to achieve goals and promote an environment of focus, cooperation, and energy. •Leadership begins with the person, not the position. There will be different ‘types’ of leaders on the basis of focus and influence: people/process leaders, technical stewards, engagement leaders and innovation/thought leaders. A leader may be enacting different ‘types’ of leadership according to the assignment or role or situation. •Leaders will live and model IR’s Culture & Values. Leaders will be ‘customer centric’ by keeping customers (internal or external) at the heart of every decision they make. Leaders will be ‘intelligence- led’ through their use of intelligence for decision making. Leaders will be ‘agile’ because they embrace and lead change and can enact the different ‘types’ of leadership required. When I am a technical leader: •I am interested in what’s happening with social policy measures globally. •I enjoy solving problems that no one has solved before. •I value the contributions and perspectives of others. When I am an strategic & thought leader: •I am curious about future trends and possibilities. •I connect ideas across industries. •I am productive when things are uncertain. •I act with the customer in mind. When I am a people & process leader: •I understand what drives my people and use this to motivate them. •I provide clarity on priorities so my team can get them done. •I encourage debate to make decisions and accept responsibility for outcomes. When I am a connector •I listen to understand what my stakeholders value. •I find common ground when there is conflict. •People trust me to be a settling influence in tough times. Core Leadership Expectations -Leaders will be agile, enact different types of leadership and support IR’s transformation Strategic & Thought Leadership Technical Leadership People & Process Leadership System & Connecting Leadership Agile & responsive •I maintain my composure and positivity when things are uncertain. •I work with my peers to clear obstacles and problems. •I lead, follow, coach and mobilise different people and teams to deliver on shared commitments. •I place wider, organisational goals ahead of my own. •I focus on outcomes and always try to a do things better. •My team are clear about what’s expected and are given autonomy to deliver value. Intelligence-led •I am curious about wider contextual subjects. •I create and use insight to exercise sound judgement. •I share knowledge and resources freely and behave transparently and with integrity. AgileCustomer centricIntelligence led Customer centric •I ask proactively questions and seek to understand other perspectives -customers, colleagues, stakeholders and partners. •I act with the customer in mind. •My customers, colleagues, and stakeholders have seen that they can trust me. •I can be held to account for commitments I make. IR’s future cultureAll leaders enact the future culture Leadership will exist across the organisation. A leader will be agile and will enact different types of leadership. IR Leadership Framework SSC Leadership Success Profile What we will expect of our leaders to transform IR The capabilities a leader will need to demonstrate to deliver the expectations 20 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Business Transformation Future State Organisation Design Blueprint A public value balance score card will be used to drive towards whole of organisation achievement of goals and outcomes. The organisational outcomes work builds on the outcomes and measurement frameworks and thinking that already exists and is beingtaken forward in IR. Simplified Outcomes Framework Organisational achievement will be driven and measured through a Public Value Balanced Scorecard. Note: The domains and indicators noted are indicative and will be used as the basis of further analysis and development in the next phase of work. Indictors should be few (<20) and critical. Organisation level indicators •Each indicator within the balanced score card will require a specific organisational goal statement, a baseline level of performance and a target level of performance. Functional level indicators •Will be developed with each organisation capability so it can deliver its part of the organisational indicators. •Indicators will be cascaded from org level to group and team level. Individual performance indicators •org and functional level indicators will be cascaded to individuals’ performance agreements •How we will measure individuals’ contribution. The indicator targets will be cascaded from organisational to functional and team level, and then to individuals. There will be four scorecard domains -two on external value and impact, and two on internal efficiency and effectiveness, with indicators: External •External customer focus will positively influence voluntary compliance -customer experience, compliance cost, certainty and perceived public value. •Achievement of value for Government – will consist of benefits realisation, revenue collected, entitlements disbursed, levels of debt, productivity, all of government contribution, policy advice, economic and social wellbeing. Internal •Increase efficiency and effectiveness of internal operations –change agility, internal customer experience, information and intelligence generation, implementation of strategies and plans. •Opportunity and growth –critical capability development, alliances and partnerships, workforce engagement. A balanced scorecard approach cascaded through levels will provide assurance around the successful implementation of strategy. It will focus activity around what is most important for everyone in IR to achieve.

They will have no formal decision rights. •Bring outside views into IR. This will include delivery partner and alliance representatives to ensure an ecosystem view. Externals also cover gaps in experience of IR members. •Perspectives given on matters such as IR’s public value, challenging the usual ways of working, innovation and trends, and how IR will be viewed in the community. External advisory bodies Future state governance and decision making concepts: •Governance is supported by a strong culture of trust and whole-of-organisation way of working. Decision making will be aligned to leaders’ accountabilities and responsibilities so that only the most critical decisions are endorsed via governance. •Inclusion of wider eco-system perspectives throughout the model. The model will evolve towards progressive and increasing effectiveness. •Risk-aware decision making will be supported by intelligence-led approaches and functional expertise. Governance will be responsible for challenging the status quo, supporting our innovation impetus, and providing a check and balance of risk and assurance. •Governance standards and settings cater to the statutory roles of the Commissioner and Chief Executive. •Will set strategic direction, objectives, and target performance for organisation. Responsible for organisational risk identification and oversight and strategic opportunity evaluation. •Will monitor the health and integrity of the system and the overall progress of performance towards outcomes. •Will be the endorsement/escalation point for decisions from standing committees only where required. •Number of externals on Board could increase over time compared to IR members, depending on balance of delivery of services via IR or others. Executive/ Organisation (includes external member/s) •Two committees will review the collective impact of performance against the organisation scorecard and provide an assurance perspective on working group decisions. The committees will focus on reinforcing customer-centric ways of working. •Will provide executive decisions and visibility to the organisation on matters such as investment decisions, sector accountability, planning, people/resourcing. •The committees will be innovation champions. Standing Organisation Committees Functional working groups CIR/CE Enabled by business information, risk - based decision framework and proactive secretariat that will monitor the model’s effectiveness External advisory body •Working groups will supplement the formal governance model by bringing together leaders from relevant organisation capabilities. These leaders will work cross organisationally on organisation goals, new initiatives and areas of focus that will arise from strategic directions set by the overarching Board. •Will drive the integration of functional decisions against IR’s business outcomes through the deployment of resources to meet organisational objectives. •External advisory bodies may be formed to supplement requirements of the working group. Working groups – organisational goals, new initiatives, focus areas such as technical , digital Overarching Board -Focus on org strategy and risk External advisory body External advisory body External domains -Focus on customer-facing decisions eg, delivery partners, services Internal domains -Focus on operational decisions including HR, IT, investment, planning. As a leader I am trusted to make effective decisions. Our value-add governance processes help to direct, support, and align my decisions with organisational outcomes, through a strong system-wide and innovation focus. Our organisational achievement is assured through this model. Organisation decision making and assuring organisation performance will be carried out through a tiered governance model that will reflect the future state culture and ways of working 22 Note: The model presented is indicative and the concepts noted in this material will be used as the basis of further design workas our future state takes shape. Formal governance Cross organisational ways of working IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Business Transformation Classified In Confidence –Inland Revenue Highly ProtectedFuture State Organisation Design Blueprint \[IN CONFIDENCE\] APPENDIX: Suggested organisation design alternatives for Tax Counsel functions Reactions to this design aspect (as represented through KDDs 5 and 6) from various groups is summarised as: •Perceived reduced efficiencies in the process of routing a customer’s case from the point of interaction (CS) for deep tax technical clarification (BS), for adjudication (SAS) or for the enforcement and litigation (BS). •Perceived reduced effectiveness due to the split of tax/legal stewardship, advice and independent adjudication (SAS) from the operational tax and legal functions (BS). SAS will not easily be able to exercise oversight, influence and control without appropriate resource and contact points for funnelling cases or escalations. •Escalation and adjudication can be viewed as ‘operational’ functions that can be consolidated as part of BS. This however, willtrade off independence of adjudication from other operations, and will be mitigated by appropriate process and governance. Considerations: There are two options as alternative to the design of the future state: 23 OptionFutureDesign: IndependentTax Advisory, Escalation and Adjudication in SAS. Taxpayer and Public Rulings in BS Option 1: All of OCTC current functions in SASOption 2: All ofOCTC current functions merged into BS Description•Segregation and independence of escalations, advice, dispute review and adjudications from aspects of operations. •Legal / tax technical will be consolidated in BS as a professional service to be accessed by other parts of the organisation (particularly CS) for advice. Legal and tax practitioners will sit within BS. •Stewardship for legal / tax will lie with Tax Counsel role in SAS. •CS workforce will be up-skilled to understand tax products generally and be able to apply it to the customer lifecycle and context. •Taxpayer Rulings (TRU) and Public Rulings (PRU) will be in BS. •Rulings, escalation and adjudication will be grouped into Strategy and Advisory Services. •Legal / tax technical, other than those noted, will be consolidated in BS as a professional service to be accessed by other parts of the organisation (particularly CS) for advice. •Stewardship of tax technical community will sit within Tax Counsel role in SAS. •Segregation and independence of escalations and adjudications from operations in CS and BS. •Rulings, escalation and adjudication grouped in Business Services. •Stewardship of tax technical community closely connected to all technical functions in BS. •Legal / tax technical capability and functions are consolidated in BS as a professional service to be accessed by other parts of the organisation (particularly CS) for advice. Benefits•Consolidation of nearly all legal and tax operational functions in BS. •The legal/technical parts of the business, and their governance/oversight, are and will be of strategic importance to IR. •Escalation & Advice (E&A) does and will produce advice as a “release valve” for issues that are uncertain in BS. •The independence of Dispute Review Unit (DRU) adjudication/review decisions will be reinforced structurally with the separation of the operational arms of the business. •Groups many expert technicalfunctions together for synergies and better building of capability. •Assists “Tax Counsel” oversight and governance as it provides critical mass, resources, involvement and attraction of issues (is a possible vehicle for exception management?). •Tax Counsel ability to shift resources between units to meet relative demands. •Issues of equivalent importance/difficulty will be done in a single (specialised) group. •Easier to sustain a culture of technical excellence in a smallish, more specialised, group. •Less disruption to OCTC functions during parts of Transformation. •Independence of adjudications from rest of operations in CS/ BS (except for rulings). •Consolidation of whole tax technical and legal capability, including stewardship results in possible efficiencies. •All customer facing operations grouped into CS and BS, will make work flows easier to manage. •Broad and cohesive management of all legal/technical functions under a single functional manager. •Can still retain the 4 OCTC functions, or decide to merge/rearrange. •The legal aspects of rulings and advice will be done in a single (large) group – but not all rulings, as investigators are heavily (even primarily) involved in binding rulings done by I+A. •Greater legal/technical resources in the large group to adjust to meet temporary demands. •Telegraphs a shift in expectation of BS (Managers) for being the centre of technical excellence. Trade-offs•Perceived reduced efficiencies as a result of segregation. •The E&A and DRU functions are different in kind from other parts of Strategy & Advising. •Insufficient critical mass/resources and involvement in issues to guarantee effective “Tax Counsel” oversight and issues management in relation to the IR legal/technical Business. •Small number of total personnel will result in limitations to outputs and also limited resource flexibility. •Adjudication is a customer-facing function and does not purely align with the proposed segregation. •Potential for difficulties in ensuring streamlined decision-making as segregation causes issues for resolving inconsistencies / differences in perspectives between E&A/DRU and TRU/PRU/BS. •SASwill have no other operational arms. Greater dilution of SAS role. •The segregation of the rulings functions from rest of operational legal technical expertise will limit the potential efficiencies of combining all legal functions. •OCTC itself has relatively limited resources, which are inevitably constraining. •Retains a relatively complicated management structure for the legal/technical functions. •Possible loss of opportunity to create a culture of technical excellence in the larger group. •Raises questions regarding the role/expectations of senior managers in BS, and the legal/technical issues management and decision-making (compared to OCTC), and whether this will be different to the present state. • Inabilityto monitor the rulings and advices to taxpayers that may continue to be done in different parts of the Department. •No separate/specific oversight of technical/legal at an organisational Governance/Strategic level. •No separation/independence from Business Services, in a structural sense, for adjudication/dispute review. This willrequire mitigation by process and governance. •Uncertainty regarding the role or placement of -or even need for -a “Tax Counsel” function (rather than position).

The changes being introduced in Release 2.0 are: Legislative changes effective 1 April 2018 (including payday filing of employer information and the Accounting Income Method for provisional tax) Budget 2017 changes (including Income tax and Working for Families tax Credit rates and thresholds ) Collecting employer Information in START, and processing it in FIRST Automatic Exchange of Information (AEIO) in START Collections and Community Compliance campaign leads in START New work being managed as a CASE in START Imagingof returns, structured forms, unstructured correspondence Keying (batch data entry) in START instead of \[Information redacted\] for Release 2.0 returns and structured forms New payment and disbursement channels and processes New eServicesfor customers Moving three tax product groupings to START : Withholding tax – 8 products Gaming Machine Duty –3 products Fringe Benefit Tax – 3 products The changes being introduced in Release 3.0 are: Income Tax Working for Families Tax Credits Customer master in to START Context and Introduction We are seeking approval for the Core Tax and Policy Release 2.0 Organisation Impact Assessment and Change Implementation Plan (D2117). This deliverable provides the detail for the people readiness component of the Business Readiness Framework, specifically: 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] A total of 4,700 people are impacted to varying degrees by Release 2.0. This impact has factored in the new groups, teams and roles in CCS-I, CCS-B and IIS. A large portion of employer information work (EMS) will move into START. EMS is a core information source for most of our tax types and is a part of most roles in Service Delivery with amendments and error resolution requiring work to be done across two systems. Our people will need to be ready to support our customers t hrough the transition period, with a focus on education through Community Compliance, LE Services and Contact Centres. More than 700 of our people will use START for the first time and will b e required to work in both FIRST and START; Transactional mostly for EMS, Litigation Management, Community Compliance, International Revenue Strategy and Corporate Legal for case management. The look and feel and navigation for employer information in S TART is very different to FIRST and will take time to learn. Many of our people will need to work across both systems Broad awareness of higher volumes of credit transfers between s ystems and the potential impacts should failure occur is required. The high impact is due to cross account transfer and number of co-existence interface files. Changes to imaging, case management and the introduction of o ther tax types (e.g. FBT, Withholding Taxes) Legislative changes across AIM/PAYE/AEOI. Increasing numbers of people will be required to do co-ex istence work across Service Delivery and PF&F (reporting and revenue accounting). New workflow and security permissions will be active in START b ased on new roles and delegations in the new business groups – CCS-I, CCS-B and IIS.

More detail is provided in Appendix A. 2.User Support - t h e IRKB and START on- line help are a key component of ensuring our people have the procedural information they need in both FIRST and START, and are kept informed of changes during Early Life Support. 3.Introduction of ‘Key Users’, mad e up of people from across business units and locations, to work on a variety of Release 2.0 programme activities and, at the same time, build their capability so they can assist with embedding and sustaining the solution. 4.Tailored Communications f or each of the four change groups. 5.The people change readiness asse ssments provide assurance to decision-makers that IR’s people in highly impacted areas are ready for each release. 6.The Early Life Support (ELS)ap proach and plans will be developed later this year and will be developed with many people across the Release 2 teams. Business groups impacted by Tax and Policy Release 2.0 have been segmented into four change groups based on degree and type of impact. The change group determines the level and type of change activity required to ensure our people are ready for go-live, with a focus on training, on-the-job support tools, communications and people readiness. 4 Change groups and alignment to the new organisation from February 2018 We are confident that our change groups will map to the segments and teams in the new CCS-I, CCS-B and IIS organisations .

For Release 2 it has been identified that: For most people at IR for Release 2, a larger portion of their work will be either in START, or require co-existence with START. Revised planning based on the two release strategy indicates that there will be an anticipated reduction in training duration/effort because the extent of training our people require will reduce, although this cannot be quantified reliably until the detailed Training Needs Analysis is complete and decisions about workflow are made. It will impact 4000+ people. To manage the complexity, the business groups impacted have been segmented into four change groups based on degree and type of impact – from high touch to low touch. The T raining Needs Analysis for Release 2 for Tax and Policy will be initially based on current state then mapped to future statenow the new Organisational Design is finalised. Business units and team leaders will play a larger role in determining the training needs of their people based on their skill sets and the work they will do. Training will be planned over a 4 - 6 month window – pre learning, on-line learning, classroom training and on the job learning (supported by Key Users) a key component of the overall approach. Classroom training will be delivered close to go live. We will build on the training branding, media and methods of Stage 1 and continue to use L earnIRfor access to learning pathways and materials. We will do some things differently based on lessons from Stage 1: Introduce ‘Key Users’, made up of people from across business units and locations, to work on a variety of Release 2.0 programme activities and, at the same time, build their capability so that they can assist with embedding and sustaining the solution Focus on the big things IR people need to know well for Day 1/Week 1 v ersus other information they can learn more slowly (just in time training); including targeted training sessions for leaders Train our people to support customers through the Release 2 customer change (aligning to our customer approach) which will besig nificant both in customer numbers and complexity Align to the integrated approach to learning by providing opportunities for our people to have more time for informal and on th e job learning (being the 70% experiential learning (10%/20%/70%)) alone and/or with their peers,supported by learning delivered formally, online and in the classroom; A START training environment to provide learners with more tailored practice pre go-liv e; Smaller class size, from 16 to 12 and supported by Key Users in the classroom. Engage leaders more actively throughout the training life cycle and potentially train a wider group of managers and team leade rs where their teams will be most impacted 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] For Release 2: A team of 8 people will start in July to make all required updates for Release 2. The team will work closely with the Training team to ensure alignment and integration. Changes to what we build will be required after go-liv e and this will be managed as part of Early Life Support. Online Help will provide high level guidance, rather than step-b y-step instructions. This is in line with our new way of working – users will decide the best way to complete tasks. What we’ll be doing: Documenting Release 2 operational policy and procedure content for internal use only in START Online Help and START Contextual Help. Updating Contextual Help for difficult operational tasks within START where r equired. Updating (merging) or overriding START Core Help with IR-s pecific content as required. Aligning the Release 2 START Online Help content under the relevant Help Table o f Contents category. Archiving IRKB pages no longer relevant post Release 2 go-liv e. Reviewing and updating IRKB pages and calculators impacted by Release 2 Removing/updating Stage 1 Co-E xistence procedures in START Online Help and the IRKB that are no longer relevant or need changing. Updating new Release 2 Co-E xistence procedures in START Online Help and the IRKB. Online Help •Online Help will be more high level than the IRKB, in line with our new ways of working. •Approach will change as START Online Help will be developed earlier to support training pilot requirements. •Review and testing approach changing to help maintain balance between procedural support for our people and embedding the new ways of working. Contextual Help •This form of help will be used more in Release 20.0 with the aim of helping support people with a further reduction of step-by -step instructions in START Online Help. •Contextual help will be added in START when certain criteria is met. Core Help •Will continue to be built and developed by FAST as needed. •Can be found in same search and index as START Online Help pages. •Will continue to be hidden or customised if they do not fit in a New Zealand context for Release 2.0. The IRKB and START On-Line Help are a key component of ensuring our people have the procedural information they need to work in both FIRST and START, and are kept informed of changes during Early Life Support. Change approach snapshot –User Support 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Key features of the tailored communications approach are: Support impacted teams and their leaders with targeted information, predominantly via face-to-face engagement. Continue to build awareness and understanding by regularly updating IR people on progress towards go-live and key milestones through existing channels. A targeted approach will be used for staff and leaders aligned with the change management groupings. Emphasis on face-to-face engagement and discussion using existing channels, and some new ones. Leaders will be supported with regularly updated key messages and resources which they can use to continue to consistently lead and inform their teams and incorporate into their own communications to their business areas. Communications activity will be aligned with other BT communications (Our New Organisation and Intelligent Workplace) and with broader IR internal communication, to ensure consistency and to avoid ‘information overload’. Business Transformation Managers will be a key conduit for information, and will be supported with a structured communications and engagement programme. Change approach snapshot –Tailored Communications 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Change approach snapshot –People Change Readiness Assessment Key features of the people change readiness assessment are: To provides assurance to decision-m akers that IR’s people in the highly impacted areas are ready for Release 2 in April 2018. Create a key check in that will confirm that “we are where we expect to be” at key po ints and as an input to the Business Readiness Checkpoints beginning in October. Method will be via a survey sent to Team Leaders to completed following a discussion with their team members. Thresholds will be set to indicate acceptable levels of readiness. The results will also hel p us to identify any gaps and issues early, so we can re-plan accordingly. Training metrics (for example enrolment and completions) will be tracked to ensure t hose that must be ready for go-live have completed the relevant training on schedule. Key people metrics will be monitored throughout implementation for those teams in Gr oups A & B. This will serve three purposes: to identify any ‘red flags’ that might affect the success of the implementation, provide data for post-implementation review and a comparison as we move through successive stages of BT. Group A: Population Samplefor survey, in-depth interviews with key teams and monitoring of training and people metrics. GroupB: Population Sample for survey and monitoring of training and people metrics. Group C: Population Samplefor survey and monitoring of training and people metrics.

For example, Financials grace periods/credit transfers/manual actions Appendix A : Updated Assessment of Training Impact 13 August, 2017WIP \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Service Delivery > Collections BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Returns & Forms Employer information will be collected in START (both monthly and for payday reporting) and sentto FIRST for processing assessments as a monthly file. EMS amendments and some error resolution actions must be completed in START. Information sent to FIRST will not be in real time. Ourpeoplewill need to work across two systems whencompleting tasks that depend on EMS information which may increase time spent on a task and because of the delay in processing information across the two systems. Returns & Forms Conversion will create some “ghost” returns like it did in Stage 1 to manage the conversion of transactions in FIRST that do not have a return associated to them. Our people will need clear guidelines for working with converted transactionsand data. Tasks that involve working with converted data may take longer initially as our people adapt. eServices/myIR Functionality introduced for stage 1 becomes available for products as they are migrated and mastered in START in Release 2 e.g., file and pay (direct debit), instalment arrangements and managing account access. Note: START will not include PAYE payment functionality during co- existence. Our people will need to be aware of this and understand the options they have to educate and assist customers in real time, e.g. viewing customer sessions. Payments One-offdirect debit payment option from Australian Bank Accounts when customers want to file and pay will be available for products in START from April 2018 and other products as they are migrated from FIRST in Release 3 and future releases. In future stages this option may expand to other countries and regular payment options. Future stages of BT will see this option expand to other countries and regular payment options. Ourpeoplewill need to be aware of this option so they can inform and assistcustomers to access this expanding payment channel. Compliance Child Support teams managing amendments to employer deductions will need to update information twice – in START and FIRST. Design still TBC in regard to processes involved when converting EMS to correspondence. Amending child supportdeductions on the EMS will take longer as our people will need to update two systems. Compliance Insolvencies will be managed as a case within START. This case type will manage the entire process from IR commencing liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings to the completion of liquation or bankruptcy. This case type will include insolvencies where IR is notified of an insolvency even if the customer has no debt with IR. Our people will need to knowhow to use new cases and additional case functionality. Initially this may reduce productivity as the way these types of work are handled changes. These cases will mean cases and associated information (including documents) will be accessible from START. Compliance Adjustment cases for write-offs and remissions will be updated to accommodate more than one entity per case. Our people will need to knowhow to use new cases and additional case functionality. Initially this may reduce productivity as the way these types of work are handled changes. These cases will mean cases and associated information (including documents) will be accessible from START. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Service Delivery > Collections BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Compliance Adjustment cases for write-offs and remissions will be updated to accommodate more than one entity per case. Our people will need to knowhow to use new cases and additional case functionality. Initially this may reduce productivity as the way these types of work are handled changes. These cases will mean cases and associated information (including documents) will be accessible from START. ​Analytics Campaign design will continue to be managed outside of START before the data is loaded into START where scoring and prioritisation can be applied using Discovery Manager before leads are created. Our people who manage workflow for those business areas that are actioningleads will need to be aware of the process however this should have minimal impact on their day to day activities. Financials There will be some conversionimpacts in relation to grace periods as START and FIRST apply them independently of each other. Our people will need to be aware of the implicationsof this in order to support customer queries and account maintenance activities. Financials Credit Transfers between START and FIRST (auto and manual) have added complexity. Our people will need to apply care when transferring credits between systems to avoid errors. Financials Incremental late payment penalties are removed from the 2017/18 year (legislative change). Our people will need to be aware of the implicationsof this in order to support customer queries and account maintenance activities. Financials Increases to assessments (e.g., as a result of an audit) will result in additional bill items being added to a period for products in START from April 2018 and other products as they are migrated from FIRST in Release 3 and future releases. There may be multiple bill items on a period which will give more flexibility to manage penalties & interest particularly when there are different due dates for increases in the assessment. Our people will need to be aware of the implicationsof this in order to support customer queries and account maintenance activities. Audit & Case Existing LTS prosecution cases expanding to include work done by Collections and Audit before it reaches LTS. Our people in Audit, Collections and LTS that deal with these cases will need to know how to use the added functionality. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Service Delivery > Investigations& Advice BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Returns & Forms EMS information will be collected in START and sentto FIRST for processing assessments. Amendments must be completed in START. Information sent to FIRST will not be in real time. Ourpeoplewill need to work across two systems whencompleting tasks that depend on EMS information which may increase time spent on a task and may need to incorporate additional time for the delay in processing information across the two systems. eServices/myIR New online filing options (generally an upload or onscreen entry option) introduced for Financial Institutions to replace existing options, e.g. emailed spread sheet, iron key or CD/DVD. Our people will need to be aware of the new options for tax poolers and Financial Institutions in order to be able to assist any customer queries. There may be some initial increase in contact from these entities as they adjust to the new options. Disbursements Domestic bank accounts will be updated in IVR or eServices with an exception option available (actioned by a small group of our people). All ofour peoplewill need to transfer customers to the IVR to update their domestic bank account details. Disbursements International disbursements will be managed in START for products in START from April 2018 and other products as they are migrated from FIRST in Release 3 and future releases. Customers will be able to add their overseas bank account number in eServices. Ourpeoplewill need to be aware of howto manage international disbursements so they can inform and assistcustomers. Audit and Case Pre-audit case will become a stage in a standard audit group rather than a separate case. Audit indicators will be applied differently and adjustments will be made to reporting so reporting still separates Pre-Audit and Audit cases Our people will need to know that Pre-auditis now a stage in the audit group. The functionality of this stage isn’t different from the current Pre-Audit case. Audit and Case Working papers for reassessment of returns will look different and become more complex for products in START from April 2018 and other products as they are migrated from FIRST in Release 2, release 3 and future stages. Ourpeoplewill need to know how touse the new working papers to reassess returns. Initially this may reduce productivity as our people learn how to use these new working papers. Until release 3, Income tax, donations and ICA reassessments will need to continue to be done in FIRST with the continued use of the Heritage Paper and FIRST interface. Management of voluntary disclosures is TBC. Audit and Case More cases and case types will be added to START including AEOI cases, Film Grants cases, Wine Equalisation Tax cases, Compliance Manager Reviews, Specialist Audits including Transfer Pricing, International cases, and Digital Forensic/Computer Tax Audit cases. Still TBC for cases relating to SE/LE risk review, HWI risk review and tax pooling, likely release 3. There will also be changes to Prosecution cases which will be opened by Collections or Audit before referral to LTS. Someof our people may be new to START and there will be new START case functionality to learn. This may lead to an increase in task time as our people adapt to new processes and functionality. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Service Delivery > Investigations& Advice BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Audit and Case There will be new working papers for return amendments and our people will need to know how to manage PAYE discrepancies as a result of an audit when the Return is in START and the financials are in FIRST. Our people will need to check both systems to ensure they access information that reflects any co-existence related timing impacts. This may increase task times especially if EMS changes are also involved. Audit/Case Investigators will be working with converted returns and data from day one, noting it will take up to four years from the day each tax type is converted before there will be converted periods within the statutory time bar. While it is possible for investigators to work on periods with only START native data it maybe 2 years or more before some investigators do audits on periods with only START native data Investigators will need a thorough understanding of the converted data rules and how to work with converted data including auditing converted periods. Investigators will also need to know how to convert unconverted periods for new START tax types. This may add time to existing tasks as they incorporate working with converted /unconverted data into processes, this will be similar to stage 1. Analytics Risk review and screening of returns including all amendments will be automated via START Integrity manager for products in START from April 2018and other products as they are migrated from FIRST in Release 3 and future releases (note design may evolve in future releases). There will be new tasks and workflow to manage integrity holds and integrity-related work items. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Service Delivery > Customer Services BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Customer New case types will be introduced to capture Voice of the Customer information. Ourpeoplewill needto be trained in the new case types to collect this information. Our people will also need to be aware how to access and report on information collected by these cases. Returns & Forms EMS information will be collected in START and sentto FIRST for processing assessments. Amendments and error resolution actions must be completed in START. Information sent to FIRST will not be in real time. Ourpeoplewill need to be working across two systems whencompleting tasks that depend on EMS information which may increase time spent on a task and may need to incorporate additional time for the delay in processing information across the two systems. Returns & Forms A new START work item will be created for EMS amendments that result in a credit to manage the credit in FIRST. Our people will need clear instructions and training on any new work items to manage co- existence of EMS information. Returns & Forms There will be new manual sorts for returns and correspondence.These will all be imaged as unstructured correspondence for processing in START. Sorting, keying and imaging paper returns, forms and correspondence may take longer. Returns & Forms Paper returns and forms currently keyed through Halex will be imaged (not OCR) and manually keyed directly into START from the image for products in START from April 2018 and other products as they are migrated from FIRST in Release 3 and future releases. Imaging and keying paper returns and forms will take longer. Returns & Forms Return conversion will create some “ghost” returns like it did in Stage 1 to manage the conversion of transactions in FIRST that do not have a return associated to them. Ourpeoplewill need clear guidelines for working with converted returns, transactionsand data, including co-existence considerations so they assist customers and do account maintenance. eServices/myIR Functionality introduced for stage 1 becomes available for products as they are migrated and mastered in START in Release 2 e.g., file and pay (direct debit), instalment arrangements and managing account access. Note: START will not include PAYE payment functionality during co- existence. Our people will need to be aware of this and understand the options they have to educate and assist customers in real time, e.g. viewing customer sessions. There may be an initial increase in customer contact as they encounter new functionality for the first time, e.g., the direct debit option. Payments One-offdirect debit payment option from Australian Bank Accounts when customers want to file and pay will be available for products in START from April 2018 and other products as they are migrated from FIRST in Release 3 and future releases. In future stages of BT this option may expand to other countries and regular payment options. Ourpeoplewill need to be aware of this option so they can inform and assistcustomers to access this expanding payment channel. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Service Delivery > Customer Services BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Payments A new account type will improve processing bulk payments (from customers who make single payments on behalf of multiple customers) within START. Payments teams will have a number of new processes which may increase some task time initially as these are embedded. Managementof bulk payments should improve and remove workarounds introduced for stage 1. Disbursements Domestic bank accounts for products in START from April 2018 and all other products from April 2019 (including Social Policy) must be updated in the IVR; there will be an exception process. There may be an increase to AHT for bank account updates ifour peopleare required to stay onthe line as the customer completes the update. Disbursements International disbursements will be managed in START for products in START from April 2018 and other products as they are migrated from FIRST in Release 3 and future releases. Customers will be able to add their overseas bank account number in eServices. Ourpeoplewill need to be aware of howto manage international disbursements so they can inform and assistcustomers. Disbursements There will be new work items to manually review failed disbursements from START if the disbursement remains failed after 15 days of the automated ‘failed disbursement’ process. Ourpeoplewill need to know howto how to action this new work item. Financials The Payment Priority order has been operating within each system independently of each other during stage 1, with all FIRST tax types prioritised over all START Tax types. However as there will be more tax type in START in release 2 and 3 this will become more evident. Ourpeoplewill need to be aware of the implications of this in order to support customer queries and account maintenance activities. Financials There will be some conversion impacts in relation to grace periods as START and FIRST apply them independently of each other. Ourpeoplewill need to be aware of the implicationsof this in order to support customer queries and account maintenance activities. Financials Transfers between START and FIRST (auto and manual, and for both payment transfers/reversals and credit transfers) have added complexity and volumes will increase. Our people will need clear instructions and will also need to apply extra care when transferring payments/reversals or transferring credits between systems to avoid errors. Compliance Billing will be consolidated to minimise the output to customers whilst still providing the same level of detail to the customer, this is particularly beneficial to customers with multiple related actions to complete. Ourpeoplewillneed to understand the consolidation of information so they are able to effectively support customers. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Service Delivery > Customer Services BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Compliance Community Compliance will be managing campaign work through leads in START. The entire lead can be assigned to one of our people, who will then complete the actions within the lead (actions could include things such as Face to Face meeting with customer). Community Compliance Officers will need to understand how to use the lead functionality within START. This may impact upon productivity as our people adapt to the new functionality. Compliance Child Support teams managing amendments to employer deductions on the EMS will need to update information twice – in START and FIRST. Design still TBC in regard to processes involved when converting EMS to correspondence. ​Handling amendments for Child Support deductions on the EMS will take longer as our peoplewill need to update both START and FIRST with the changes. There is some risk that the systems will get out of sync although messaging in both FIRST and START to remember to update the other system may help reduce the risk. Audit and Case Community Compliance will use START Case Manager for case work. Community Compliance Officers will need to understand how to use START Case Manager and may need a to agree a transition approach for moving their case work into START. Financials There will be some conversionimpacts in relation to grace periods as START and FIRST apply them independently of each other. Our People will need to be aware of the implicationsof this in order to support customer queries and account maintenance activities. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Service Delivery >Telephony BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Creditcard payments via the IVR channel and eServices will be enabled for Release 2 and 3 products. This may shift some calls from Collections to Interactional as anyone can pass the customer through to the IVR option. For Collections this option will be significantly faster and will reduce call handling time. Domestic bank accounts for START products must be updated in the IVR; there will be an exception process. Our leaders will no longer need to verify bank accounts for START products. SPK2IRcall flows will be modified to retrieve Release 2 and 3 product information from START.This should ensure customers are able to remain in a self-service channel to receive information about Release 2 and 3 products in SPK2IR. NewSIP-enabled WDE softphone will be rolled out to enable easier and improved call routing along with a new call recording solution. Our people who use a WDE softphone will use it for all their inbound and outbound calls with all calls recorded. It will replace their \[Information redacted\] desk-phone. People who listen to calls will use a new portal. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts Service Delivery >Litigation Management BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Audit and Case ​Litigation Management cases will be in START. ​Litigation Management people will be accessing START for the first time, will need training in START Case Manager.Litigation Management may need to agree a transition approach to move their cases into START. There may be an initial increase in time spent on managing cases during any transition period. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Service Delivery >Performance& Optimisation BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement START cannot completely replace all macros currently used for release 2 and 3 products.There will be some capacity loss across the business as some tasks previously managed by macros may require manual actions instead until Release 4. This will need to be understood and may require evaluation of impacts post go-live. There will be new workflow design, delegations and process changes reflected in online help and content hub material that will need to be supportedand maintained as part of deployment and transitioning to the business. There may be an increase in time spent in managing both deployment activities and transitioning work to business areas beyond go-live. There will be changes in the volumes of work items and task times across the business, due to but not limited to: •Release 2 and 3 design resulting in changes to volumes of output (e.g. timing and/or consolidation of billing items) •Reduction in stage 1 co-existence tasks as Release 2 and 3 products come into START •Introduction of new co-existence tasks for Release 2 and 3 products There may be an increase in profiling and forecasting activities as the business prepares and adapts to these changes leading up to and post Release 2 and 3 go-live. There will be some customer experience change for products that are affected by co-existence processes. There may be a need to analyse the impact of the experience change at a product level to inform business decisions and/or influence opportunities for continuous improvement actions. With the introduction of more case types there will be more time recording in START e.g. Community Compliance, Digital Forensics Unit. There may be an increase in need for support to our people as they adapt to time recording in START and how this interacts with other workforce management tools. Thereis greater degrees of impact to our service providers which will require relationship management effort. This includes changes for intermediaries (both design changes and the effects of co-existence) along with managing options for software developers as ‘gateway services’ deploys AIM etc. Theremay be a need for additional support to our service providers that complements activities delivered by BT. This could increase the level and amount of relationship management efforts. In particular there is a need to determine who will be responsible for on- boarding software developers in the new organisation . This is to be confirmed. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Performance, Facilities & Finance BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Customer There will be new account types to manage items such as bulk payments and payroll subsidy. There may be some initial analysis to determine the requirements for any new or different reporting needs due to the introduction of these account types. eServices/myIR New filing options have been designed to collect information from Financial Institutions (for RWT) and those who make bulk payments on behalf of customers. Analysts may need to be aware of the design and theremay be different report requirements to reflect the introduction of new filing options. Payments Newpayment options become available for release 2 and 3 products in addition to the introduction of \[Information redacted\] for international direct debit payments from Australian bank accounts. There may be some new reporting requirementsin relation to these new options. Crown Accounting may have an increase in effort initially as new payment processes are embedded by the business and any flow on outcomes are monitored. Disbursements Urgent & most international disbursements can be managed in START for products in START from April 2018 and other products as they are migrated from FIRST in Release 3 and future stages. Any international disbursements for products in START that can’t be processed in START will be referred to FM Operations via a START work-item to be processed via the \[Information redacted\] portal. Therewill be a reduction in manual effort by the FM team in managing urgent and international disbursements. Disbursements Disbursement files between IR and \[Information redacted\] will auto-reconcile. This automation removes the need for two signature sign off for the disbursements file. Work items will be generated if it does not reconcile. Accounting The expected volume and complexity of financial transfers across START and FIRST will result in additional reconciliation effort and complexity. There will be an increase in the volume, complexity and effort in relation to reconciliation activities. Our front-line people will need clear instructions and training in financial transfers as errors have a significant knock-on effect to Revenue Accounting. Accounting Combining data from two systems for financial and performance reporting, including Revenue Estimation Reports for \[Information redacted\], will be complex. There willbean increase in time and complexity for validating, analysing and the manual collation of information across two systems to ensure the integrity of the information being reported upon. Our people will need an in-depth understanding of the way START collects data and the differences in reporting methodologies between START and FIRST. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts In Confidence \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Information, Intelligence & Communications BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Compliance Campaign design and select will continue to be managed outside of START with additional effort required during co-existence, including working with the new TDW.Campaign select data will then be loaded into START where some scoring and prioritisation can be applied using Discovery Manager before leads are created. This includes additional campaigns for Hidden Economy and Community Compliance specific work. Tailored training will be needed to manage all campaign types and to incorporate working with data from FIRST and START in the new TDW. There may be additional time spent on creating selects for campaigns during co-existence with the added complexity of joining up data from FIRST and START.This will include working with the START Discovery Manager once campaigns are loaded in START. Analytics Anonymous Information and InfoRep items will be lodged in START by our people. START will perform some automated checks to attempt customer identification, where relevant, as part of populating a work item for the iHub team to manage. Existing business processes and actions taken remain the same, however where there is a START work item, this will be where summary information is captured.Based on security, this summary information will be visible to the appropriate roles. All of our people will need to be aware of how to lodge anonymous information and InfoRep items. Our people managing these work items will need to know how to add or complete these tasks in START and although their approach to the work will not change, this may lead to an increase in task time initially as they adapt to the new system. Security settings will allow appropriate people to view the summary detail in the work item on the customer which will remove the need for our iHubteam to extract a PDF version of their summary information upon request. Analytics START’s Integrity manager will run across more than just returns, e.g. bank accounts changes will be included when the change is to an international account number. Additional items are still under consideration. As more data buildsthere may be a need for analysts to spend additional time considering the impacts of new integrity plans in START. Across areas A number of release 2 design options will require significant updates to content for customer outputs (including online materials) and new functionality will need to be well communicated and marketed. This may involve additional effort during early life support (ELS). Thismay lead to an increase in workload and some reactive work efforts. Information Sharing Changes to information sharing interfaces. Informationsharing hub need awareness of changes to interfaces. Note impact assessments in relation to information sharing are being carried out by the TAD team. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Corporate Integrity & Assurance BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Auditand Case Corporate Legal maybeginto use START’s case management functionality for their case work including employment file, commercial file and general file types. In addition to training, Corporate Legal may need to agree a transition approach to move their cases into START. This may increase time spent on case management if there is a need to co- exist for a period of time. Our people may need dedicated time available to adapt to START functionality and navigation. Security Changesto the START security matrix as a result of more work in START and the proposed organisation design based on broad new roles and delegations. Potential differences in how START security and Business Risk Control checks and Business Management Controls operate from current, to be determined by work currently underway on security matrix/delegations/workflow. New/different reporting requirements in relation to security from START. Oversight of security and delegations in the new system to enable risk and integrity monitoring , internal audit and understanding of reporting. Will require continued involvement in design and some training.

Organisational design
=====================

A key part of our Business Transformation (BT) was looking at our organisational design.

The Executive Leadership Team was essential to the design process. The time commitment required from this team for consultation and engagement was considerable. Our Commissioner was also the sponsor for organisational design.

Having the right people
-----------------------

Like other areas of the transformation, we needed people who had done this before. We brought in a highly experienced Organisational Design and Change Director to run the organisational design process. 

The design team was made up of a mix of people with deep knowledge of the organisation, supported by change managers that included internal and external consultants.

Rigorous design governance is crucial.

Our approach
------------

### Design approval process

We used 3 steps to confirm our design process.

1.  The Organisational Design Council, a subset of the Executive Leadership Team, reviewed and recommended our initial design.
2.  The Executive Leadership Team signed off on this.
3.  The Commissioner, our organisational design sponsor, gave final approval.

Each part of the transformation programme including the design was reviewed by management consultants KPMG, as part of the external independent and technical quality assessment.

Top-down, bottom-up design
--------------------------

The Executive Leadership Team led the top-down design, focusing on the future state of the organisation structures. These were based on what we expected to be doing in future, rather than what we did at the time.

Bottom-up design focused on what we wanted our future business processes to be. This defined the roles, teams and workforce capacity. We then reviewed this and lined it up with the top-down design. 

Our people
----------

For true transformational change, every role within the organisation needed to be looked at. The Commissioner made sure the second-tier roles were reviewed and lined up with the new structure. 

We worked closely with unions, investing time in consultation and engagement. We also brought our union colleagues into the design process, specifically around task-based and broader roles.

Large or incremental change?
----------------------------

In February 2018, we made significant changes to the organisation and we did it quickly. We moved more than 3,900 operational people into roles within the new operating model all at the same time and the impact on our people was huge.

As we close out the transformation, the Leadership Team acknowledges that it was a big stretch for our people but agrees that it made the right decision.

By starting the transition to become a customer-centric and intelligence-led organisation early, we were able to deliver some early benefits as well as on our promise to make tax and social entitlements more simple, open and certain for New Zealanders. For example, the first Individual income tax assessment process in 2019 would not have been possible without having set up the new organisation in 2018.

Improving along the way
-----------------------

Looking back at the first change, some parts of the process needed improvement. 

In July 2018, stage 1 of the organisational design was independently reviewed. This review led to us changing the delivery approach, and the change in leadership to the Deputy Commissioner, Corporate Integrity and Assurance.

The recommendations from this review played a big part in each of the following organisation design and delivery phases. These all ran successfully, although they involved much smaller groups of people.

The changes included: 

*   building a change integration team to bring together the many pieces of this kind of change and coordinate the timing and communication
*   making sure people were aware that the Inland Revenue’s Executive Leadership Team were leading the change, and there to support them
*   sharing the likely impacts of change with our people earlier, giving more time for feedback 
*   when high-level impacts were known, helping our leaders to communicate these to their people 
*   having more people in the change process - including HR professionals and change people   
*   improving the selection and assessment process we used to recruit people into roles
*   supplying the ‘people transition team’ with better tools to support the transition, including fixing data issues that caused problems for our people
*   focussing more on supporting our leaders, helping them transition and get used to their new roles before their teams came on board. 

Moving to business as usual
---------------------------

In the later stages of the organisational design, we created new functions to include areas and tasks carried out by the programme team over the over the life of the Business Transformation programme. These were Strategic Architecture, Strategic Portfolio Stewardship and Planning Design and Delivery.

We also set up a Transition and Business Integration workstream within the programme. This supported the transition of knowledge, processes, and practices from the programme to the organisation and enabled a more gradual transition of responsibility to the new functional leads. In turn, this allowed them to focus on setting up their teams, keeping a large number of our Business Transformation people and the intellectual property within Inland Revenue.

GST treatment of supplies of telecommunications services
========================================================

OS 06/01 sets out IR's operational practice and guidelines for the GST treatment of cross-border supplies of telecommunications services.

This statement also appears in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 3 (April 2006).

#### Introduction

1.  This Operational Statement (OS) sets out Inland Revenue's operational practice and provides guidelines as to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) treatment of cross-border supplies of telecommunications services under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act). In particular, it provides operational guidelines on the ordering rule that determines the person who initiates a supply of telecommunications services.

#### Application

2.  This OS sets out Inland Revenue's position on the application of the law in this area.  
      
    
3.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this OS refer to the GST Act.

#### Background

Background to the GST legislation in the context of telecommunications services

4.  Before 2003, the general "place of supply" rule and zero-rating provisions in the GST Act were not easily applied to cross-border supplies of telecommunications services. This led to uncertainty as to when supplies of telecommunications services were subject to GST in New Zealand.  
      
    
5.  Besides the need for certainty, an important GST principle in the context of telecommunications services is neutrality. A different GST treatment between resident and non-resident telecommunications suppliers would be undesirable because it would distort the behaviour of consumers and suppliers of telecommunications services. For example, if GST did not apply to imported telecommunications services, New Zealand consumers would be encouraged to substitute these services for the services supplied by local telecommunications suppliers.  
      
    
6.  The New Zealand Government published a discussion document, GST and Imported Services - a challenge in an electronic commerce environment in June 2001. The discussion document considered the GST treatment of telecommunications services.  
      
    
7.  The GST treatment of cross-border telecommunications services was clarified in the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 by inserting into the GST Act specific "place of supply" rules, zero-rating provisions and definitions relating to the context of telecommunications services.  
      
    

#### Legislation

8.  The relevant legislative provisions in the GST Act are:

*   the definitions of "content", "non-resident", "resident", "telecommunications services" and "telecommunications supplier" in section 2, and  
    
*   sections 8, 8A, 11A, 11AB and 51.

9.  For the purpose of the definitions of "non-resident" and "resident" in the GST Act, sections OE 1 and OE 2 of the Income Tax Act 2004 (the ITA 2004) are also relevant.

#### Discussion

#### "Telecommunications services" for GST purposes

10.  It is important to distinguish "telecommunications services" from other services. As discussed later, "telecommunications services" are subject to specific "place of supply" and zero-rating rules for GST purposes. Suppliers of telecommunications services are also subject to a specific GST registration exception (see section 51(1)(e)).  
      
    
11.  The term "**Telecommunications services**" is defined in section 2(1):

> **"Telecommunications services"** means the transmission, emission or reception, and the transfer or assignment of the right to use capacity for the transmission, emission, or reception, of signals, writing, images, sounds or information of any kind by wire cable, radio, optical or other electromagnetic system, or by a similar technical system, and includes access to global information networks but does not include the content of the telecommunication.  

12.  Based on this definition, examples of "telecommunications services" include a telephone call, accessing the internet via an internet service provider, a video conference, or a facility such as a leased lines agreement, website hosting or server hosting.  
      
    
13.  "**Telecommunications services**" exclude the content of the telecommunication. The term "content" is further defined in section 2(1):

> **"Content"** means the signals, writing, images, sounds or information of any kind that are transmitted, emitted or received by a telecommunications service.

14.  Examples of telecommunications content include information obtained via an 0800 toll free number and images downloaded from an internet server. These do not form part of the "telecommunications services".

#### Telecommunications supplier

15.  The term "telecommunications supplier" is defined in section 2(1):

> **"Telecommunications supplier"** means a person whose principal activity is the supply of telecommunications services.

16.  Examples of telecommunications suppliers include landline and mobile phone service providers and internet service providers.

#### Residency rules for GST purposes

17.  The residency rules for GST purposes are relevant to the determination of the GST treatment of cross-border supplies of telecommunications services. As discussed later, the application of the general "place of supply" rule in section 8(2) and the specific GST rules on supplies of telecommunications services depends upon the GST residency of the supplier.  
      
    
18.  Section 2 defines the terms "resident" and "non-resident" for GST purposes. These terms make cross-references to sections OE 1 and OE 2 of the ITA 2004, so that a taxpayer resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes under sections OE 1 and OE 2 of the ITA 2004 will also be resident in New Zealand for GST purposes.  
      
    
19.  Section OE 2 applies to companies. The discussion in this OS is limited to the GST residency rules that apply to companies, as most suppliers of telecommunications services are companies, rather than natural persons.  
      
    
20.  In addition to section OE 2, a company may be treated as a resident in New Zealand if paragraph (a) of the proviso to the definition of "resident" in section 2 applies. The company is deemed by paragraph (a) of the proviso to be resident in New Zealand to the extent that:  
      
    1.  the company carries on a taxable activity or any other activity in New Zealand, and  
          
        
    2.  it has a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand which relates to that taxable activity or other activity.  
        

21.  Paragraph (a) of the proviso contemplates apportionment. A company can be a resident to the extent that paragraph (a) of the proviso applies. The company can also be a non-resident to the extent that paragraph (a) of the proviso does not apply (but only if it is not otherwise a New Zealand resident under section OE 1 or OE 2 of the ITA 2004).

#### GST treatment of supplies of telecommunications services made by a resident in New Zealand

22.  Section 8(2) states the general "place of supply" rule for GST purposes. That legislative provision treats services (including telecommunications services) provided by a person, who is a New Zealand resident, as services supplied in New Zealand.  
      
    
23.  If the person, being a New Zealand resident, is GST-registered and makes supplies in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity, the supplies are prima facie subject to GST at 12.5% under section 8(1).  
      
    
24.  However, telecommunications services can be zero-rated under section 11AB if they are made to:  
      
    1.  an overseas telecommunications supplier (see section 11AB(a)), or  
          
        
    2.  a person who is not an overseas telecommunications supplier for a telecommunications service that is initiated outside New Zealand (see section 11AB(b)).  
          
        
25.  The term "overseas telecommunications supplier" is not defined in the GST Act. The term refers to a telecommunications supplier who is a non-resident in New Zealand for GST purposes.  
      
    
26.  It should be noted that under section 11A(5), other GST zero-rating rules do not apply to supplies of telecommunications services.  
      
    

#### GST treatment of supplies of telecommunications services made by a non-resident in New Zealand

27.  The general "place of supply" rule in section 8(2) treats supplies of telecommunications services made by a person, who is non-resident in New Zealand, as services supplied outside New Zealand. Prima facie, these supplies are not subject to GST under section 8(1).  
      
    
28.  However, section 8(6) overrides the general "place of supply" rule under section 8(2). The provision treats telecommunications services as being supplied in New Zealand if:
    
    1.  the supplier is a non-resident of New Zealand, and  
          
        
    2.  a person, who is physically in New Zealand, initiates the supply of telecommunications services from a telecommunications supplier.  
          
        
29.  Section 8(6) applies notwithstanding that the person may initiate the supply of telecommunications services on behalf of another person. Section 8(9) determines the person who initiates the supply of telecommunications services. It also determines whether the specific "place of supply" rule in section 8(6) applies. (Please refer to paragraphs 34 to 39 for details.) Section 8(6) is subject to a number of exceptions however (as set out in paragraph 33 below).  
      
    
30.  Where the specific "place of supply" rule in section 8(6) applies (i.e. the telecommunications services are initiated in New Zealand under section 8(9)), the telecommunications services supplied by a non-resident supplier are treated as being supplied in New Zealand and are therefore subject to GST at 12.5% under section 8(1) if the non-resident supplier is registered or required to be registered for GST.  
      
    
31.  Where a non-resident telecommunications supplier makes supplies of telecommunications services that are treated as supplied in New Zealand and the total value of supplies exceed $40,000 (GST exclusive) in any 12-month period, the supplier must register for GST under section 51.  
      
    
32.  However, GST registration is not required, where the $40,000 registration threshold is exceeded solely as a result of making supplies of telecommunications services to non-residents, who are physically in New Zealand, or to persons whose physical location cannot be determined, but whose billing address (excluding post office boxes) is in New Zealand. For example, non-resident telecommunications companies do not have to register for GST in New Zealand solely because they make supplies to non-resident customers who use "roaming" services while staying in New Zealand (see example 11 in this OS).

#### Exceptions to the application of the specific "place of supply" rule section 8(6)

33.  Where a non-resident telecommunications supplier makes supplies of telecommunications services, the specific "place of supply" rule in section 8(6) does not apply in the following three situations:  
      
    1.  supplies between telecommunications suppliers: where a non-resident telecommunications supplier makes a supply of telecommunications services to another telecommunications supplier, section 8(7) provides that the supply is not treated as being made in New Zealand under section 8(6). Accordingly, the supply will not be subject to GST. This result applies even if the supply is initiated in New Zealand.  
          
        
    2.  telecommunications services supplied by a non-resident to a GST-registered person for the purposes of carrying on that registered person's taxable activity: section 8(8) provides that unless the supplier and the recipient of the supply agree otherwise, the services are treated as being supplied outside New Zealand and will not be subject to GST.  
          
        
    3.  subject always to the rules in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, where it is impractical for the telecommunications supplier to determine the physical location of the initiator due to the type of service or class of customer: section 8A(1) provides that the services must be treated as being supplied in New Zealand if the person's address for receiving invoices from the telecommunications supplier (excluding a post office box) is in New Zealand.

#### The ordering rule under section 8(9)

34.  Determining which party has initiated a supply of telecommunications services is fundamental to the operation of the specific GST rules on telecommunications services. It determines whether a supply made by a non-resident telecommunications supplier is treated as being made in New Zealand under section 8(6). It is also relevant for determining whether a supply of telecommunications services can be zero-rated pursuant to section 11AB(b).  
      
    
35.  Section 8(9) sets out the ordering rule to determine the person who initiates a supply of telecommunications services:
    
    > For the purposes of subsection (6) and section 11AB, the person who initiates a supply of telecommunications services is the person who-
    
    1.  Is identified by the supplier of the services as being-  
        1.  The person who controls the commencement of the supply:  
              
            
        2.  The person who pays for the services:  
              
            
        3.  The person who contracts for the supply; and  
              
            
    2.  If more than 1 person satisfies paragraph (a), is the person who appears highest on the list in that paragraph.

36.  In order to apply the ordering rule, it is first necessary to determine what is being supplied. Is it a telecommunications service and what is the telecommunications service?  
      
    
37.  Once the supply has been identified as a telecommunications service, the next step is for the telecommunications supplier to determine who initiates the supply. Where the service supplied is a discrete voice, data or other telecommunications transmission, a telecommunications supplier may be able to identify a person who controls commencement by undertaking an action that clearly enables the service to be provided such as dialling the telephone number or accepting a reverse charges call. It is likely that this person also pays for the service and has organised for the service to be provided.  
      
    
38.  However, in other situations, there may be no clear action or person that can be identified by the telecommunications supplier as controlling commencement. This may occur particularly where the service supplied is the facility to make or receive voice, data or other telecommunications transmissions (which may also include such transmissions).  
      
    
39.  Where the telecommunications supplier cannot identify the person who controls the commencement, the initiator of the supply will be the person who pays for the telecommunications services. The contractual arrangements between the parties need to be considered when it is not possible to ascertain the payer for the telecommunications services. In this situation, the person who contracts for a supply of telecommunications services is the person who initiates the supply.

#### GST treatment of regional telecommunications services arrangements

40.  Regional telecommunications services arrangements may exist where a telecommunications supplier supplies telecommunications services to a company, which has branches and/or subsidiaries in a number of countries. The company receives only one invoice covering all branches and/or subsidiaries to which telecommunications services are supplied. The company then recharges the cost of telecommunications services to its branches and/or subsidiaries. (Please note that a recharge is a separate supply for the purpose of the "reverse charge" provisions and is discussed below in paragraph 104.)  
      
    
41.  The telecommunications services supplied under the regional telecommunications services arrangements will be subject to the specific "place of supply" and zero-rating rules in sections 8, 11A and 11AB as discussed above.  
      
    
42.  As a consequence of the regional telecommunications services arrangements, the company may supply recharge/cost allocation services to its branches and/or subsidiaries. The cost allocation services are not "telecommunications services".  
      
    
43.  However, the recharge/cost allocation services may be subject to the reverse charge mechanism under section 8(4B). This is because under section 8(4C), a recharge/cost allocation from a non-resident to a resident is treated as a supply of services that satisfy section 8(4B)(a) and (c).  
      
    
44.  The GST treatment of supplies of telecommunications services under regional billing arrangements is explained further in example 8 of this OS.

#### Operational Practice

45.  Inland Revenue's operational practice in relation to the application of the ordering rule and the GST rules on telecommunications services is illustrated in the examples below.

#### Examples

#### Example 1: international toll call from New Zealand

46.  Peter, a New Zealand resident, uses his New Zealand home telephone to call a friend in Australia. Peter is charged by his telecommunications supplier, NZ Telco, for making the call. NZ Telco (a New Zealand resident company) routes the call to the international destination, via Aus Telco's network. Aus Telco charges NZ Telco an interconnection fee.

![Diagram of GST treatment of supplies of telecommunications services when using an international toll call from New Zealand.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/6/2/62050f804ba377edb41abd9ef8e4b077/pic-1.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214236&hash=8F50B3608AF559CA26A1515CA0FB1B5E)

\[ \]

_International toll call - supply by NZ Telco to Peter_

47.  The supply is an international toll call and is supplied by NZ Telco to Peter. As NZ Telco is a New Zealand resident, section 8(2) deems this to be a supply made in New Zealand. The supply is subject to GST at 12.5% under section 8(1) and cannot be zero-rated under section 11AB because:  
      
    1.  There is no supply of telecommunications services to an overseas telecommunications supplier.  
          
        
    2.  The supply of telecommunications services is not initiated outside New Zealand. Peter controls the commencement of the supply by dialling the international telephone number in New Zealand (being the action which clearly enables the service to be provided) and therefore initiates the supply under section 8(9).

_Interconnection services - supply by Aus Telco to NZ Telco_

48.  Aus Telco is a non-resident for GST purposes. Therefore, the interconnection services supplied by Aus Telco to NZ Telco are deemed to be a supply outside New Zealand under section 8(2). As interconnection services fall within the definition of "telecommunications services", the additional place of supply rules in sections 8(3), (4) and (4B) do not apply (see section 8(5)). Furthermore, the specific telecommunications "place of supply" rule in section 8(6) does not apply, as both Aus Telco and NZ Telco are telecommunications suppliers (see section 8(7)). Therefore, the supply of interconnection services is not subject to GST in New Zealand.

#### Example 2: using the internet

49.  Sue is a South African resident. She is on holiday in New Zealand and uses a computer in an internet café ($2 per hour) to download rugby results from a New Zealand website (NZ Co). The internet service provider (ISP) for the New Zealand website is NZ Telco, a New Zealand resident company. NZ Telco charges NZ Co a hosting fee and also charges Internet Café NZ Limited a monthly internet connection fee.

![Diagram of GST treatment of supplies of telecommunications services when using the internet.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/6/4/64ff00804ba377ebb3ccbf9ef8e4b077/pic-2.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214238&hash=2EB75ABF761A6D5943EC482B9C8E0AEA)

\[ \]

_Internet access - supply by Internet Cafe; NZ Limited to Sue_

50.  The supply is hourly access to the internet (a global information network) and, accordingly, is a telecommunications service under section 2(1). Internet Café NZ Limited is a New Zealand resident company. Therefore, under section 8(2), the supply of telecommunications services is deemed to be made in New Zealand.  
      
    
51.  The supply is subject to GST at 12.5% under section 8(1) and cannot be zero-rated under section 11AB(b) because the supply of telecommunications services is not initiated outside New Zealand. Sue controls the commencement of the supply by connecting to and accessing the internet (being the actions which clearly enable the service to be supplied). Therefore, Sue initiates the supply in New Zealand under section 8(9).

_ISP service - supply by NZ Telco to Internet Café NZ Limited_

52.  An ISP service, being the provision of access to the internet, falls within the definition of "telecommunications services" in section 2(1). As NZ Telco is a New Zealand resident company, the service is deemed to be supplied in New Zealand under section 8(2).  
      
    
53.  The supply is subject to GST at 12.5% under section 8(1). It cannot be zero-rated under section 11AB because it is not a supply to an overseas telecommunications supplier and the supply is not initiated outside New Zealand. Both NZ Telco as the provider of the service and Internet Café NZ Limited as the recipient could be considered to control commencement of the supply. Accordingly, there is no clear action or person that can be identified by NZ Telco as controlling commencement. Therefore, Internet Café NZ Limited is the initiator as they pay for the service.

_ISP hosting service - supply by NZ Telco to NZ Co_

54.  The supply is the provision of an ISP hosting service and is supplied by NZ Telco to NZ Co. This is a telecommunications service, being access to a global telecommunications network. NZ Co is charged a hosting fee.  
      
    
55.  As NZ Telco is a New Zealand resident, the ISP hosting service is deemed to be supplied in New Zealand under section 8(2).  
      
    
56.  The supply is not zero-rated under section 11AB because NZ Co is not an overseas telecommunications supplier and the supply is initiated in New Zealand. Both NZ Telco as the provider of the service and NZ Co as the recipient could be considered to control commencement of the supply. Accordingly, there is no clear action or person that can be identified by NZ Telco as controlling commencement. Therefore, NZ Co is the initiator as they pay for the service.

**Example 3: call to a person using an international roaming service**

57.  Jack, a New Zealand resident, uses his New Zealand home telephone to call Jill's mobile phone. Jill is a New Zealand resident and is on holiday in Australia. As her mobile phone has international roaming capability, she answers the call in Australia. Jack is charged by his telecommunications supplier, NZ Telco, for making a call to a New Zealand mobile phone number. The call is routed by NZ Telco to Aus Telco and then to Jill's mobile phone. NZ Telco charges Jill a roaming charge for delivering the call to her in a foreign destination. Aus Telco charges NZ Telco an interconnection fee.

![Diagram of GST treatment of supplies of telecommunications services when calling a person using an international roaming service.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/b/4/b44630804ba377edb427bd9ef8e4b077/pic-3.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214239&hash=2B7CE03EF9BEDA6148D912E323261C29)

\[ \]

_Mobile phone call - supply by NZ Telco to Jack (New Zealand resident)_

58.  The supply by NZ Telco to Jack is a call to a New Zealand mobile phone. As NZ Telco is a New Zealand resident, section 8(2) deems this supply to be made in New Zealand.  
      
    
59.  The supply is subject to GST at 12.5% under section 8(1). It cannot be zero-rated under section 11AB because it is not a supply to an overseas telecommunications supplier and the supply is not initiated outside New Zealand. Jack controls the commencement of the supply when he dials the mobile phone number. The supply is therefore initiated in New Zealand under section 8(9).

_Roaming service - supply by NZ Telco to Jill (New Zealand resident roaming in Australia)_

60.  The supply is an international roaming service (connecting Jack's call to Jill) and is supplied by NZ Telco to Jill. As NZ Telco is a New Zealand resident, section 8(2) deems this supply to be made in New Zealand.  
      
    
61.  The supply is zero-rated under section 11AB(b). This is because Jill, who is not an overseas telecommunications supplier, initiates the supply of a telecommunications service (international roaming) outside New Zealand. Although Jill does not make the mobile phone call, she controls commencement of the international roaming service. This is through answering the call in Australia, having taken her mobile phone to Australia and connected to the overseas network (being actions which enable Jack's call to be connected to Jill.)  
      
    
62.  It is important to note in applying the ordering rule under section 8(9), that contractual arrangements do not determine who controls the commencement of the supply. The contractual arrangements are relevant to the determination of who initiates the supply only when it is not clear as to who controls the commencement of the supply and who pays for the telecommunications services.  
      
    
63.  In this example, Jill has entered into a contract with NZ Telco in New Zealand. The contract allows international roaming while Jill is overseas. This, however, does not mean that the international roaming service is initiated in New Zealand.

_Interconnection services - supply by Aus Telco to NZ Telco_

64.  As Aus Telco is a non-resident, the interconnection services are deemed to be a supply outside New Zealand under section 8(2).  
      
    
65.  As interconnection services fall within the definition of "telecommunications services", the additional place of supply rules in sections 8(3), (4) and (4B) do not apply (see section 8(5)). Furthermore, the specific telecommunications "place of supply" rule in section 8(6) does not apply, as both Aus Telco and NZ Telco are telecommunications suppliers (see section 8(7)). Therefore, the supply of interconnection services is not subject to GST in New Zealand.

#### Example 4: international call-backs

66.  Carolyn, who is New Zealand resident and not GST-registered, enters into a contract with a non-resident "call-back" telecommunications company (Call-back Telco) to make international telephone calls from New Zealand. Carolyn dials Call-back Telco's New Zealand local number and enters the details of a USA telephone number. Carolyn then hangs up her telephone. The non-resident call-back operator, using favourable international calling rates, places the call to the USA telephone number advised by Carolyn and then calls back Carolyn's original phone number to complete the call circuit between New Zealand and the USA.

![Diagram of GST treatment of supplies of telecommunications services when using International call-backs.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/0/3/038c61004ba377eeb434bd9ef8e4b077/pic-4.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214242&hash=6A7122AEE3DC67BE726544DA06E1CA90)

\[ \]

_Interconnection services - supply by NZ Telco to Call-back Telco_

67.  Call-back Telco contracts with NZ Telco to enable it to supply a calling service in New Zealand. Carolyn is not a party to this contract. The supply is the provision of interconnection services by NZ Telco to Call-back Telco. As NZ Telco is a New Zealand resident, section 8(2) deems this supply to be made in New Zealand. However, as it is supplied to an overseas (i.e. non-resident) telecommunications supplier, the service can be zero-rated under section 11AB.

_Call-back service - supply by Call-back Telco to Carolyn (a NZ caller)_

68.  The supply is the provision of a call-back service which is supplied by Call-back Telco to Carolyn. As Call-back Telco is a non-resident for GST purposes, section 8(2) deems this supply to be made outside New Zealand.  
      
    
69.  As the call-back service falls within the definition of "telecommunications services", the additional place of supply rules in sections 8(3), (4) and (4B) do not apply (see section 8(5)). However, under the specific telecommunications "place of supply" rule in section 8(6), the supply will be deemed to be made in New Zealand if it is initiated by a person in New Zealand.  
      
    
70.  Although Call-back Telco dials the USA telephone number, Carolyn controls the commencement of the call-back service. This is through making the original telephone call and providing the USA telephone number (being actions which clearly enable the service to be supplied). Therefore, Carolyn initiates the supply of the call-back service under section 8(9).  
      
    
71.  Consequently, section 8(6) applies and the supply of the call-back service is treated as being made in New Zealand. Section 8(8) does not apply because Carolyn is not GST-registered. The supply is not zero-rated under section 11AB because it is not made to an overseas telecommunications supplier or initiated outside New Zealand.  
      
    
72.  Therefore, Call-back Telco will be required to register for GST under section 51 and charge GST on the supply of the call-back service, if their supplies exceed the registration threshold of $40,000 (GST exclusive) in a 12-month period.

#### Example 5: video conference

73.  NZ Co contacts a New Zealand resident telecommunications company (NZ Telco) to arrange a video conference between its sales staff in New Zealand and a potential customer in China (Target Co). NZ Co arranges the video conference for a set time and is the registered contact and chairperson for the video conference. In order to provide the video conferencing service between New Zealand and China, NZ Telco obtains access to a bridge (a facility using interconnection software that is part of the overall telecommunications service) supplied by Aus Telco in Australia. In addition, NZ Telco's video conferencing facilities and China Telco's facilities are used to provide the service. NZ Co's sales staff in New Zealand dials the bridge and the customer in China dials the bridge to start the video conference. NZ Co pays for the video conferencing service (including the related video conferencing facilities).

![Diagram of GST treatment of supplies of telecommunications services when using video conference.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/6/b/6bdb42804ba377eeb441bd9ef8e4b077/pic-5.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214237&hash=123E88BE8A8F18EE30727CB37F4BB187)

\[ \]

_Video conferencing service - supply by NZ Telco to NZ Co_

74.  The supply is the provision of a video conferencing service (including necessary facilities), and is supplied by NZ Telco to NZ Co. As NZ Telco is a New Zealand resident, the service is deemed to be supplied in New Zealand under section 8(2).  
      
    
75.  Under section 11AB, the supply will be zero-rated if it is made to an overseas telecommunications supplier or initiated outside New Zealand.  
      
    
76.  The video conference service is provided following a number of steps, including:

*   negotiation between NZ Co and NZ Telco,  
      
    
*   communication of arrangements for the video conference,  
      
    
*   NZ Co's sales staff dialling the bridge to start the video conference, and  
      
    
*   the customer in China dialling the bridge to start the video conference.

77.  As both NZ Co and Target Co dial the bridge to start the video conference, there is no clear action or person that can be identified by NZ Telco as controlling commencement. Therefore, NZ Co is the initiator as they pay for the service. The supply cannot be zero-rated under section 11AB(b) and will be subject to GST at 12.5%.

_Interconnection services - supplies by Aus Telco and China Telco to NZ Telco_

78.  In respect of the interconnection services from Aus Telco and China Telco to NZ Telco, the suppliers are non-residents. Under section 8(2) both supplies are deemed to occur outside New Zealand.  
      
    
79.  Pursuant to section 8(7), the "place of supply" is not altered by section 8(6) as the supplies of interconnection services are made between telecommunications suppliers. The supplies of interconnection services by Aus Telco and China Telco to NZ Telco are not subject to GST.

#### Example 6: toll-free calling service

80.  An Australian travel agency (Aus Travel Agency) has entered into an agreement with a New Zealand resident telecommunications company (NZ Telco) for a toll-free calling service. The arrangement allows customers of Aus Travel Agency, Australians on holiday in New Zealand, to call the toll-free number and be put through to Aus Travel Agency. Aus Travel Agency pays all charges for this service which may include a charge for setting up the toll-free arrangement, a monthly fee and any additional usage charges.

![Diagram of GST treatment of supplies of telecommunications services when using toll-free calling service.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/2/2/223f27804ba377efb44ebd9ef8e4b077/pic-6.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214238&hash=77C84B71C86AEB3EAD1776C40E026FAA)

\[ \]

_Toll-free service - supply by NZ Telco to Aus Travel Agency_

81.  In setting up and providing the service, NZ Telco is supplying a toll-free calling service to Aus Travel Agency. Under section 8(2), as NZ Telco is a resident, the supply is deemed to occur in New Zealand.  
      
    
82.  The toll-free calling service is provided following a number of steps, including:

*   negotiation between Aus Travel Agency and NZ Telco,  
      
    
*   allocation of a toll-free number,  
      
    
*   setting up a call-centre, and  
      
    
*   advertising the toll-free number.

83.  Both Aus Travel Agency's customers and Aus Travel Agency could be considered to control commencement of the toll-free service. Accordingly, there is no clear action or person that can be identified by NZ Telco as controlling commencement. Therefore, it is necessary to determine who pays for the service. In this example, Aus Travel Agency pays for the service and, therefore, also initiates the supply.  
      
    
84.  As Aus Travel Agency initiates the supply outside New Zealand, NZ Telco will be able to zero-rate this supply under section 11AB(b).

_Interconnection services - charge by Aus Telco to NZ Telco_

85.  The supply of interconnection services by Aus Telco to NZ Telco is deemed to be a supply outside New Zealand under section 8(2) as the supplier is a non-resident. Under section 8(7), as the supply is between telecommunications suppliers, section 8(6) does not apply. Accordingly, the supply by Aus Telco is not subject to GST.

#### Example 7: 0900 service

86.  An Australian clairvoyant (Good Vibes Limited) has entered into an agreement with a New Zealand resident telecommunications company (NZ Telco) for an 0900 number service. The service allows New Zealand callers to dial an 0900 number to access a message or speak to a Good Vibes Limited's employee for clairvoyant advice. Good Vibes Limited pays all the charges for this service which may include a charge for setting up the 0900 service, a monthly fee, and any additional usage charges. Good Vibes Limited charges the New Zealand caller, often using NZ Telco as an agent. The New Zealand caller is not registered for GST.  
    

![Diagram of GST treatment of supplies of telecommunications services when using 0900 Service.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/7/6/76e2a2804ba377efb45bbd9ef8e4b077/pic-7.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214240&hash=E65617885331EFA4987B3C3E451385C1)

\[ \]

_0900 service - supply by NZ Telco to Good Vibes Limited_

87.  The supply is the provision of an 0900 service and is supplied by NZ Telco to Good Vibes Limited. Under section 8(2), as NZ Telco is a New Zealand resident, the supply is deemed to be made in New Zealand.  
      
    
88.  Under section 11AB, the supply can be zero-rated if it is made to an overseas telecommunications supplier or initiated outside New Zealand.  
      
    
89.  The establishment of the 0900 service involves a number of steps, including:

*   negotiation between Good Vibes Limited and NZ Telco,  
      
    
*   allocation of an 0900 number,  
      
    
*   setting up a call-centre, and  
      
    
*   advertising the 0900 number.

90.  In setting up and providing the service, NZ Telco is supplying an 0900 service to Good Vibes Limited. Both Good Vibes Limited's customers and Good Vibes Limited could be considered to control commencement of the supply of the 0900 service. Accordingly, there is no clear action or person that NZ Telco can identify as controlling commencement. Therefore, it is necessary to determine who pays for the service. In this example, Good Vibes Limited pays for the service and therefore, initiates the supply.  
      
    
91.  Consequently, as Good Vibes initiates the supply outside New Zealand, NZ Telco will be able to zero-rate this supply under section 11AB(b).

_Clairvoyant advice via an 0900 service - charge by Good Vibes Limited to the New Zealand caller (via NZ Telco as agent)_

92.  The 0900 service enables the New Zealand caller to access a message or speak to a Good Vibes Limited employee for clairvoyant advice. Thus, the supply of services is the provision of clairvoyant advice via an 0900 service.  
      
    
93.  The clairvoyant advice is "the content of the telecommunications service". This is specifically excluded under the definition of "telecommunications services" in section 2(1). Accordingly, the general "place of supply" rules in the GST Act apply to these services.  
      
    
94.  As Good Vibes Limited is a non-resident, the supply is deemed to be made outside New Zealand under section 8(2). As the services are not physically performed by a person in New Zealand, section 8(3)(b) does not apply. Section 8(4) also does not apply as the New Zealand caller is not registered for GST.  
      
    
95.  However, the 0900 service supplied by Good Vibes Limited to the New Zealand caller may still be treated as being made in New Zealand and subject to GST if section 8(4B), commonly known as the "reverse charge" mechanism, applies. In the present case, as the New Zealand caller is not currently registered for GST, section 8(4B) will not apply to treat the 0900 service as supplied in New Zealand unless the New Zealand caller's acquisition of the 0900 services causes it to exceed the GST registration threshold.

#### Example 8: regional telecommunications services arrangements

96.  Aus Telco enters into an arrangement with an Australian customer (Aus Cust Co) for the provision of trans-Tasman telecommunications services. These services typically allow the transmission of voice and data and also include other regional telecommunications services for use by Aus Cust Co and NZ Cust Co (a New Zealand resident member of the Aus Cust Co Group). Under the arrangement, Aus Cust Co is to be billed for the trans-Tasman telecommunications services. Aus Telco subcontracts with a New Zealand resident telecommunications company (NZ Telco) to provide the necessary New Zealand telecommunications services. Aus Cust Co recharges a portion of the services back to its New Zealand resident subsidiary, NZ Cust Co. NZ Cust Co is GST registered. (Please note that a recharge is a separate supply for the purpose of the "reverse charge" provisions and is discussed below in paragraph 104.)

_Regional telecommunications services - supply by Aus Telco to Aus Cust Co_

97.  The supply is a regional telecommunications service which allows the parties to make or receive voice, data or other telecommunications transmissions. The regional telecommunications service is supplied by Aus Telco to Aus Cust Co. These supplies are treated as being made outside New Zealand under section 8(2), as Aus Telco is a non-resident for GST purposes.  
      
    
98.  The additional place of supply rules in sections 8(3), (4) and (4B) do not apply to telecommunications services (see section 8(5)). However, under the specific telecommunications "place of supply" rule in section 8(6), the supply will be deemed to be made in New Zealand if it is initiated by a person in New Zealand.  
      
    
99.  The provision of the regional telecommunications service involves a number of steps, including:

*   negotiation between Aus Telco to Aus Cust Co  
      
    
*   negotiation between Aus Telco and NZ Telco,  
      
    
*   advising the Aus Cust Co Group of the new regional telecommunications service, and  
      
    
*   telephone calls and transmission of data by Aus Cust Co Group staff.

100.  Aus Telco must, as always, start by considering whether it can accurately establish who controls commencement of the supply. The regional telecommunications service is organised by Aus Cust Co and also includes the services supplied to the Aus Cust Co group. As such, both Aus Cust Co and staff of Aus Cust Co group could be considered to control commencement of the regional telecommunications service. Accordingly, there is no clear action or party that can be identified by Aus Telco as controlling commencement. Therefore, it is necessary to determine who pays for the regional telecommunications service. In this example, Aus Cust Co pays for the service, and therefore, initiates the supply.  
      
    
101.  As Aus Cust Co initiates the supply outside New Zealand, section 8(6) does not apply and the supply is not subject to GST in New Zealand.

_Outsourcing services - supply by NZ Telco to Aus Telco_

102.  The supply of the outsourcing services is deemed to be made in New Zealand, as NZ Telco is a New Zealand resident under section 8(2). However, the supply is zero-rated under section 11AB(a) because it is made by a resident telecommunications supplier (NZ Telco) to an overseas telecommunications supplier (Aus Telco).

_Recharge agreement - supply by Aus Cust Co to NZ Cust Co_

103.  Aus Cust Co recharges a portion of the services back to NZ Cust Co. The recharge is a cost allocation and not the supply of telecommunications services.  
      
    
104.  The reverse charge mechanism in section 8(4B) needs to be considered if the supplies are not physically performed in New Zealand. Pursuant to section 8(4C), a cost allocation is a deemed supply of services that satisfies paragraphs (a) and (c) of section 8(4B).  
      
    
105.  If NZ Cust Co makes a total value of taxable supplies less than 95% of all supplies in the last 12 months, section 8(4B) would treat the supply as being made in New Zealand. NZ Cust Co must then pay GST on the supply at the rate of 12.5%.

#### Example 9: international roaming

106.  A New Zealand resident company (NZ Co) has a mobile phone agreement with a New Zealand telecommunications supplier (NZ Telco). Amy, an employee of NZ Co, uses her work mobile phone outside New Zealand to call an Australian business contact (Aus contact). The call is made using a foreign telecommunications supplier (Aus Telco) who has an interconnection agreement with the NZ Telco.

![Diagram of GST treatment of supplies of telecommunications services when using international roaming.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/1/e/1ef86b804ba377f0b475bd9ef8e4b077/pic-9.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214237&hash=EF7B865235C020DAB6259416FEF56308)

\[ \]

_Mobile roaming call - supply by NZ Telco to NZ Co_

107.  The supply is the provision of an international mobile roaming call by NZ Telco to NZ Co. As NZ Telco is a New Zealand resident, the international mobile roaming call service is deemed to be supplied in New Zealand under section 8(2).  
      
    
108.  However, the supply is zero-rated under section 11AB(b). Amy, initiates the supply of the international mobile roaming call service under section 8(9). She controls the commencement of the supply in Australia by taking her mobile phone to Australia, connecting to the international network and dialling the Australian telephone number (being actions which clearly enable the service to be supplied.)  
      
    
109.  Similarly, if Amy calls someone in New Zealand while staying in Australia, the charge to NZ Co for the call will be zero-rated. Furthermore, if NZ Co is charged in respect of a call by someone to Amy while overseas, the charge will be zero-rated. Amy controls commencement by answering the call in Australia, having taken her mobile phone to Australia and connecting to the international network. These are the actions which enable the service to be supplied.  
      
    
110.  Amy controls commencement of the supply notwithstanding that the contractual relationship in respect of the international mobile roaming call service is between NZ Telco and NZ Co.

_Interconnection services - supply by Aus Telco to NZ Telco_

111.  Aus Telco is a non-resident for GST purposes. Therefore, the interconnection services supplied by Aus Telco to NZ Telco are deemed to be a supply outside New Zealand under section 8(2).  
      
    
112.  As interconnection services fall within the definition of "telecommunications services", the additional place of supply rules in sections 8(3), (4) and (4B) do not apply (see section 8(5)). Furthermore, the specific telecommunications "place of supply" rule in section 8(6) does not apply, as both Aus Telco and NZ Telco are telecommunications suppliers (see section 8(7)). Therefore, the supply of interconnection services is not subject to GST in New Zealand.

#### Example 10: satellite telephone

113.  Aus Telco supplies Bruce, a New Zealand resident, with a satellite phone for use on his private yacht. Bruce uses the satellite phone to call a friend in Australia while on a trans-Tasman crossing. While Aus Telco is able to identify Bruce as the person controlling the commencement and initiating the supply of the satellite telephone call, it is unable to identify his physical location when the service is initiated. The billing address for the satellite phone service is Bruce's home address in Auckland.

![Diagram of GST treatment of supplies of telecommunications services when using satellite telephone.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/6/f/6f6fc9004ba377f0b482bd9ef8e4b077/pic-10.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214240&hash=6C88D7F6A99B422D4111B28C70C09C23)

\[ \]

_Satellite phone call - supply by Aus Telco to Bruce_

114.  Under section 8(2), the supply of the satellite phone call is deemed to be made outside New Zealand because Aus Telco is a non-resident.  
      
    
115.  However, if Bruce initiated the supply of the satellite phone call while he was physically in New Zealand, section 8(6) would deem the supply to be made in New Zealand.  
      
    
116.  In this example, it is impractical for Aus Telco to identify the location at which Bruce initiates the supply of the satellite phone call. Pursuant to section 8A(1), as Bruce's billing address for the service is a physical address in New Zealand (and not just a post office box), the service is treated as being supplied in New Zealand. The supply of the satellite phone call will be subject to New Zealand GST at 12.5% if Aus Telco is registered or required to be registered for GST.

#### Example 11: international roamer in New Zealand

117.  An Australian resident company (Aus Co) has a mobile phone agreement with an Australian telecommunications supplier (Aus Telco). Matt, an employee of the Australian company, while on business in New Zealand, uses his work mobile phone to call a New Zealand business contact. He accesses telecommunications services via a New Zealand resident telecommunications supplier (NZ Telco) who has an interconnection agreement with Aus Telco.

![Diagram of GST treatment of supplies of telecommunications services when using international roamer in New Zealand.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/c/2/c2e217004ba377f0b48fbd9ef8e4b077/pic-11.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214236&hash=AAA27EFB7DE8171E520E75E05769315A)

\[ \]

_Mobile roaming service - supply by Aus Telco to Aus Co_

118.  Matt, who is an employee of Aus Co, initiates the supply of the mobile roaming service from a telecommunications supplier when he is physically in New Zealand. Matt controls the commencement of the supply by dialling the New Zealand telephone number after taking his mobile phone to New Zealand and connecting to the New Zealand network (being the actions which clearly enable the service to be provided.) As such, section 8(6) applies and the supply of the mobile roaming service by Aus Telco to Aus Co is treated as being made in New Zealand. Prima facie, the supply is subject to GST at 12.5% under section 8(1). The supply is not zero-rated under section 11AB because it is not made to an overseas telecommunications supplier or initiated outside New Zealand.  
      
    
119.  Similarly, if Matt calls someone in Australia while staying in New Zealand, the charge to Aust Co for the call is treated as being made in New Zealand and prima facie subject to GST at 12.5% under section 8(1). Furthermore, if Aus Co is charged in respect of a call by someone to Matt while in New Zealand, the charge will also be treated as being made in New Zealand and prima facie subject to New Zealand GST at 12.5%.  
      
    
120.  Normally this would require Aus Telco to register for and charge GST in New Zealand. However, under section 51(1)(e), if the sole reason for exceeding the $40,000 registration threshold is the supply of telecommunications services to non-residents who are physically present in New Zealand, the supplier of these services is not required to register for GST in New Zealand.  
      
    
121.  Assuming that Aus Telco has no other taxable activities in New Zealand, they fall under section 51(1)(e) and therefore, no New Zealand GST is required to be charged on the mobile roaming call.

_Interconnection services - supply by NZ Telco to Aus Telco_

122.  The supply of interconnection services by NZ Telco to Aus Telco is deemed to be made in New Zealand under section 8(2), as NZ Telco is a New Zealand resident for GST purposes.  
      
    
123.  However, the supply would be zero-rated under section 11AB(a) because it involves a supply of telecommunications services by a resident telecommunications supplier (NZ Telco) to an overseas telecommunications supplier (Aus Telco).

Interaction of tax and charities rules, covering tax exemption and donee status (Dec 2006)
==========================================================================================

OS 06/02 outlines how the Charities Commission and IR will manage charitable entities and tax exemption requirements.

This Operational Statement also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 18, No 11 (December 2006).

### Introduction

1.  This statement outlines how the Charities Commission and the Inland Revenue Department will monitor and advise charitable entities of the requirements for income tax and gift duty exemptions and donee status following the opening of the Charities Commission register on 1 February 2007.  
      
    
2.  The Government has acknowledged the enormous contribution that the charitable sector makes to New Zealand. To aid in the funding of charitable organisations the Government provides a subsidy in the form of an exemption from income tax that allows such entities' spending on charitable purposes to be made out of untaxed income. Other tax benefits are also provided. Many charities and other organisations also receive an indirect subsidy through allowing donors to qualify for a rebate from their income tax.  
      
    
3.  However, it is acknowledged that there is little or no monitoring of the activities of charitable organisations. There is a lack of information about who benefits, and how, from the tax assistance provided. Furthermore, the charitable organisations have to deal with many different Government agencies on a regular basis.  
      
    
4.  The Charities Commission has been established to promote public confidence in the charitable sector, to promote the effective use of charitable resources and educate and assist charities in relation to matters of good governance and management. The Commission's functions include advising charities on matters of good governance, establishing and maintaining a charities register, monitoring registered charitable entities and reporting on matters relating to charities.  
      
    
5.  In accordance with the goals of the Charities Act 2005, Inland Revenue and the Charities Commission will work together to provide information on the tax status of charitable entities. The Commission's website may be accessed at [www.charities.govt.nz](http://www.charities.govt.nz/ "This link will open in a new window.")
     for general information and information on to how to apply for registration.

### Application

6.  This Operational Statement will apply from 1 February 2007.

  

### Background

7.  Income tax exemptions are available to trusts, societies and institutions that meet the requirements of the Income Tax Act 2004 in terms of deriving income for charitable purposes. Exemptions from income tax are provided for under section CW 34 (non-business income) and CW 35 (business income) of the Income Tax Act 2004. Under the self assessment regime an organisation must assess for itself whether these income tax exemptions apply to it.  
      
    
8.  Although taxpayers are required to self assess their tax obligations, the practice has been that charities have sought the opinion of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on their tax status.  
      
    
9.  In accordance with one of the aims of Government in establishing the Charities Commission there will, as much as possible, be a seamless interface between registration and entitlement to tax exemptions. From 1 July 2008, it will be a pre-requisite for charities wishing to obtain these tax exemptions that they are first registered with the Charities Commission as "charitable entities" under the Charities Act 2005. Once registered, charities will still need to assess for themselves whether they meet the requirements of the tax legislation to obtain a tax exemption or advantage. Inland Revenue can challenge their decision at a later date, generally by audit, but will not be involved in giving advice on charitable status prior to registration.  
      
    
10.  A working protocol has been agreed between Inland Revenue and the Charities Commission through which entities that register as charitable entities under the Charities Act 2005 will also be advised of the requirements for the charities tax exemptions.  
      
    
11.  Where the charities legislation and the Income Tax legislation do not align (business income and donee status) this Operational Statement provides advice to organisations so they can ensure compliance with the requirements for tax exemption. The Charities Commission and Inland Revenue will work together to ensure that charitable entities are aware of relevant tax information.  
      
    
12.  To enable the Charities Commission and Inland Revenue to work together provision is made for the exchange of information between the Charities Commission and Inland Revenue. Section 30 of the Charities Act provides for the supply of Charities Register information by the Charities Commission to Inland Revenue for the performance of the functions of the Revenue Acts.

  

### Summary

13.  The following is a summary only and more detail is provided within this operational statement. In brief, Inland Revenue's operational practice will be:  
    1.  entities with non-business income that are registered with the Charities Commission will prima facie qualify for the income tax exemption in respect of that income;  
        
    2.  for entities that derive business income, registration alone will not be sufficient for the business income tax exemption and they must self assess the extent to which their charitable purposes are carried out in New Zealand ;  
        
    3.  entities that currently enjoy income tax exemption should register with the Commission by 1 July 2008. Failure to do so will result in the loss of their tax exempt status until they are subsequently registered;  
        
    4.  entities currently listed as donee organisations will continue to enjoy donee status even though they may decide not to register with the Charities Commission;  
        
    5.  newly registered charities will generally not need to make separate application to Inland Revenue for donee status;  
        
    6.  organisations that choose not to become registered charitable entities may still apply to Inland Revenue for approval as donee organisations;  
        
    7.  during the transitional period (from 1 February 2007 to 30 June 2008 ) charities will retain their existing tax exempt status for income tax, gift duty and resident withholding tax;  
        
    8.  the exemption from gift duty for gifts to charitable trusts, societies and institutions will cease from 1 July 2008 where the entities have not registered with the Commission;  
        
    9.  from 1 July 2008 Inland Revenue will not issue certificates of exemption from resident withholding tax to charitable entities unless they are registered with the Commission;  
        
    10.  charitable organisations are still required to have IRD numbers;  
        
    11.  after 30 June 2008 Inland Revenue will attempt to contact charitable organisations that our records show have an exemption from income tax, and have not registered with the Charities Commission, to determine their position; and  
        
    12.  in the past Inland Revenue has suggested there be restrictions in their rules preventing entities from altering certain clauses without prior approval. Inland Revenue strongly recommends that organisations remove any requirement in their rules for Inland Revenue to consent to rule changes. To enable this to happen, Inland Revenue hereby consents to an amendment removing any such rule. Inland Revenue will not otherwise give specific approval to any rule changes.

  

### Operational Practice

14.  On becoming registered with the Charities Commission an entity will receive a letter from the Commission notifying them that their application has been successful and enclosing Inland Revenue information as to the implications for their tax position as a charity.  
      
    
15.  Trusts, societies or institutions with non-business income that are registered under the Charities Act will prima facie be treated by Inland Revenue as qualifying for the income tax exemption. There is one exception to this prima facie treatment by Inland Revenue. This relates to council-controlled organisations (CCOs) discussed at paragraph 46 below. Such entities are not necessarily entitled to the non-business income tax exemption and are encouraged to contact Inland Revenue's Large Enterprises Unit for further advice.  
      
    
16.  Inland Revenue's practice (as set out in the booklet Charitable organisations (IR 255 December 2002) at pages 38 to 45) has been that an organisation would forward a copy of its founding documents and these, which could be in draft form, would then be considered and advice given as to whether or not the organisation met the requirements for the tax exemption(s) sought. Generally we will no longer be doing this. Charities will not require, and should not expect, clearance from Inland Revenue before applying for registration with the Charities Commission. The booklet Charitable organisations is being revised and should be available in February 2007. It is recommended that you refer to this booklet for further information.  
      
    _Business income_  
      
    
17.  Trusts, societies or institutions that derive income from a business (excluding income derived by a council-controlled organisation (CCO) or local authority from a CCO) are exempt from income tax to the extent that the income is applied to charitable purposes within New Zealand, provided that no person with some control over the business is able to direct or divert income derived from the business to their benefit or advantage.  
      
    _Business income - extent to which charitable purpose carried out in New Zealand and diversion of amounts derived from the business  
      
    _
18.  For trusts, societies or institutions that derive business income, registration alone will not (as in the case of non-business income) be sufficient for the business income tax exemption. The trusts, societies or institutions must also self assess the extent to which their charitable purposes are carried out in New Zealand. Furthermore, it is required that no person with some control over the business may able to divert an amount derived from the business to their own benefit, and neither may the trust, etc be carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual.  
      
    
19.  Where the charitable purpose is not limited to New Zealand, the income is apportioned between those purposes within New Zealand and those outside New Zealand and taxed accordingly. This self assessment must be undertaken year by year.  
      
    
20.  Whether a person is able to divert an amount by materially influencing decisions is a matter of fact and degree. In any audit the documentation of charitable entities (trust deeds or constitutions, etc) will be examined to determine whether a person with some control over the business is able to exert influence that would enable that person to receive a benefit or advantage. A determination has to be made as to whether a benefit is gained or is able to be gained by a person (who has some control of the business) had it not been for the influence of that person.  
      
    
21.  A person does not have some control over a business merely because they provide professional services to the business and their ability to determine the benefit or advantage arises (i) in the course of a professional public practice, or because they are (ii) a trustee company, (iii) the Public Trust or (iv) the Maori Trustee.  
      
    
22.  If it is clear that the establishment of any benefit or advantage has been undertaken in a manner to ensure that no more than market value was paid, Inland Revenue will accept that there has been no material influence.  
      
    
23.  A payment for the provision of services or goods at market value will not be considered to be a benefit or advantage.  
      
    _What happens if a charity doesn't register with the Charities Commission by_ _1 July 2008__?  
      
    _
24.  The Charities Act provides for amendments to the tax legislation requiring a charity to be registered to qualify for a "charitable" tax exemption. If a charity is registered before the date that the amendments to the tax legislation come into force (1 July 2008), it is likely to be in a position to "seamlessly" continue to assess itself as tax exempt. However, if an organisation registers after the tax amendments are in force, that charity may not qualify for income tax exempt status for the whole year. For an entity with a 31 March balance date that is registered with the Charities Commission as of 1 February 2009 the situation would be:  
      
    Period from 1 April 2008 to 30 June 2008 tax exempt  
    Period from 1 July 2008 to 31 January 2009 liable for tax  
    Period from 1 February 2009 to 31 March 2009 tax exempt.  
      
    Accordingly it would have to file a return for the year ending 31 March 2009 to account for the period from 1 July 2008 to 31 January 2009. Inland Revenue will attempt to contact those charitable organisations that it has a record of as currently having an exemption from income tax and do not register with the Charities Commission by 1 July 2008. The purpose of this contact will be to ascertain the current intention of the organisation as to registration.  
      
    _Donee status  
      
    _
25.  The Commissioner of Inland Revenue's approval is required for donee status whether or not the entity is registered as a charity. This is a separate process from applying to the Charities Commission for registration as a charity. In order to determine whether a rebate can properly be claimed by a donor, Inland Revenue needs to consider whether the society to whom the money was donated is of a kind referred to in section KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 2004. If an entity is currently a donee organisation then its donee status will continue even though it decides not to register with the Charities Commission unless Inland Revenue has information to the effect that it no longer qualifies.  
      
    
26.  There are four general categories of donee organisations defined in paragraphs (aa) to (ad) and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is required to be satisfied that an entity complies with the relevant requirements before giving approval. Where approval is sought under paragraph (aa) for example, there are, in addition to considering whether its purposes are charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural, two further questions to be considered. These are whether the funds are applied wholly or principally within New Zealand and whether the entity is carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual.  
      
    
27.  Registration as a charitable entity does not itself confer donee status. The granting of this status will continue to be administered by Inland Revenue but the process will be simpler for many organisations.  
      
    
28.  Once a charitable entity becomes registered then, provided it has ticked the box indicating that donations are a source of income on the form it completed when applying to be registered, Inland Revenue will automatically consider whether to grant donee approval. Where donations are a source of income and the registered charitable entity has indicated that its funds are applied wholly within New Zealand then donee status will be granted. Where a charity applies a proportion of its funds overseas then Inland Revenue will need to consider whether overall the entity's funds are applied principally to charitable purposes within New Zealand. Entities will receive advice from Inland Revenue as to whether they have qualified for donee status. Registered charities which already have that status will receive a letter of confirmation.  
      
    
29.  Entities that choose not to register with the Charities Commission may continue to enjoy donee status where approval has previously been given. Where an entity would like to have donee status but does not wish to become registered as a charity, or where its purposes are benevolent, philanthropic or cultural rather than charitable, then it will need to apply to Inland Revenue for approval as a donee organisation. The booklet Charitable organisations IR 255 provides assistance.  
      
    
30.  Where an entity has had its application for registration as a charity declined, it is unlikely that it will qualify for donee status on the ground that its purposes are charitable. However approval will be granted where its purposes, although not meeting the standard of being charitable, are nevertheless benevolent, philanthropic or cultural.  
      
    
31.  Inland Revenue may review donee status where an entity which currently has that status finds that its application for registration with the Charities Commission is declined.  
      
    
32.  Although an entity may not itself qualify for donee status, a fund may be established and managed within a non-charitable organisation and such a fund may qualify for donee status. See the IR 255 Charitable organisations for information on applying for donee status.  
      
    
33.  However Inland Revenue may reconsider an entity's existing donee status where that entity applies to register as a charitable entity but its application is declined by the Charities Commission. If an entity is not a donee organisation, the donation information provided with the application to register as a charity will be forwarded to Inland Revenue for consideration. Newly registered charities will not need to make a separate application to Inland Revenue for donee status where they have indicated in their application for registration with the Commission that they will be or are in receipt of donations.  
      
    
34.  A council-controlled organisation cannot gain an exemption from income tax but may nevertheless qualify for donee status under section KC 5.  
      
    _Gift duty exemption  
      
    _
35.  Section 73(1) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 provides an exemption from gift duty in respect of any gift creating a charitable trust, or establishing any society or institution exclusively for charitable purposes, or any gift in aid of any such trust, society, or institution. From 1 July 2008 (the date that the tax amendments made by the Charities Act 2005 come into force) any such society, institution, or trustees of a trust must be registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005 in order to take advantage of the exemption. Registration may be backdated to the date of a gift to which section 73(1) applies – see section 20 of the Charities Act 2005. Section 73(2) declares that certain classes of gifts (e.g. to the Health Research Council of New Zealand) shall not constitute dutiable gifts. The classes of gifts defined in section 73(2) will continue to be exempt from gift duty even if the organisations covered by section 73(2) are not registered with the Charities Commission. Entities referred to in Section 73(2) may of course choose to register for other reasons.

36.  Charitable organisations are still required to have IRD numbers.

### _Discussion_

37.  All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 (the Act) unless otherwise stated.  
    

##### Income tax exemption  
  

38.  Under the Act income tax exemptions are available to charitable entities for income derived for charitable purposes.  
      
    
39.  From 1 July 2008, for the income tax exemptions to apply the entity must be registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005. An exception is where the charitable entity derives income indirectly from a business. Where the entity is not itself conducting the business enterprise, but the enterprise is being run, for example, by a company that carries on the business for the entity's benefit, that company is not also required to be registered (though if it itself has charitable purposes it may choose to do so). It will still need to contact Inland Revenue to ensure that we have listed it as being exempt from tax. Section 13 of the Charities Act provides for registration as a charitable entity.  
      
    _13\. Essential requirements-  
    _(1) An entity qualifies for registration as a charitable entity if,-  
      
    (a) in the case of the trustees of a trust, the trust is of a kind in relation to which an amount of income is derived by the trustees in trust for charitable purposes; and  
      
    (b) in the case of a society or an institution, the society or institution-
    
    1.  is established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes; and  
        
    2.  is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual; and
    
      
    (c) the entity has a name that complies with section 15; and  
      
    (d) all of the officers of the entity are qualified to be officers of a charitable entity under section 16.  
      
    
40.  Where trusts and societies or institutions have obtained binding rulings under the Tax Administration Act 1994 for exemptions under sections CW34 (Charities: Non-Business Income) and/or CW35 (Charities: Business Income), they will be considered to meet the "charitable purposes" component of the requirements for registration.  
      
    
41.  Where a trust, society or institution is deregistered from the charities register under section 31 of the Charities Act 2005, income earned by the trust, society or institution will no longer be exempt from the date of deregistration.

##### Charities: Non-Business Income  
  

42.  Section CW 34 of the Act (see the Appendix) provides for income tax exemptions for the non-business income (for example investment income such as interest, dividends and rent) of trusts and societies or institutions. An amount of income derived by a trust for charitable purposes is exempt from tax. Income derived by a society or institution is also exempt from income tax where the society or institution is established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes and is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual.  
      
    
43.  The requirements for registration as a charitable entity under the Charities Act and the requirements for the non-business income tax exemption under the Income Tax Act are similar in nature.  
      
    
44.  Trusts, societies or institutions that comply with the registration requirements under the Charities Act will prima facie be treated by Inland Revenue as qualifying for the income tax exemption in section CW 34, except for council-controlled organisations.  
      
    
45.  Charitable entities will, however, still be subject to audit by Inland Revenue.  
      
    
46.  The non-business income exemption for charitable trusts, and societies or institutions established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes, does not extend to income derived by council-controlled organisations ("CCOs") or income derived by local authorities from CCOs. According to the Income Tax Act definition, a CCO includes an entity (not being a company) that operates a trading undertaking for the purpose of making a profit and in respect of which one or more local authorities have: (i) control of 50% or more of the votes at any meeting of the members, or (ii) the right to appoint 50% or more of the trustees, directors, or managers. It also includes a company in which equity securities carrying 50% or more of the voting rights at a meeting of the shareholders of the company are: (i) held by one or more local authorities, or (ii) are controlled by one or more local authorities.

##### Charities: Business Income  
  

47.  Where a trust or a society or institution carries on a business then the income derived directly or indirectly from the business (excluding income derived by a CCO or local authority from such organisation), by, or for, or for the benefit of the trust, society or institution, is exempt to the extent that it is applied to charitable purposes within New Zealand, provided that no person with some control over the business is able to direct or divert income derived from the business to their benefit or advantage.  
      
    
48.  Where a trust, society or institution derives business income, registration alone will not (as in the case of non-business income) be sufficient for the entity to be exempt from income tax. There is the requirement that at to least to some extent the trust, society or institution carry out its charitable purposes in New Zealand (an apportionment test), and the further requirements that no person with some control over the business is able to divert an amount derived from the business to their own benefit, and that the trust, etc is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual.  
      
    
49.  Under the self assessment regime taxpayers are obliged to assess their own tax obligations. In the case of trusts, societies or institutions that derive income from a business it is imperative that the entity self assesses its tax status correctly. Inland Revenue may monitor registered charitable entities that are in business for compliance with section CW 35. The following paragraphs are provided for the assistance of charitable entities that derive business income.  
      
    
50.  Section CW 35(1) also applies to companies that carry on a business for the benefit of a trust, society or institution and do not have charitable purposes or objects. Such a company does not have to register with the Charities Commission in order for the business income that is directed to a trust, society or institution to be exempt. The amount of business income so directed will be exempt from income tax provided the recipient trust, society or institution-  
    *   carries out its charitable purposes in New Zealand ; and  
        
    *   the trust, society or institution is itself registered with the Charities Commission.

##### In New Zealand  
  

51.  Income derived directly or indirectly from a business is exempt to the extent that the charitable purpose is performed in New Zealand. Where the charitable purpose is not limited to New Zealand, the income is apportioned between those purposes within New Zealand and those outside New Zealand. (See section CW 35(4) below.)  
      
    
52.  For example, income derived from a business for the benefit of a trust for the education of Pacific Island children, will be exempt to the extent that the income is used for the education of Pacific Island children in New Zealand. Income from the business used for the education of Pacific Island children outside of New Zealand would not be exempt.  
      
    
53.  It is advisable that funds used in New Zealand and outside New Zealand are separately recorded within the accounting records.

##### Control over business  
  

54.  Where a person (by virtue of their capacity as a trustee, settlor, shareholder or director) has some control over the business and is able to divert an amount derived from the business to his/her own benefit or advantage, the income derived by the business will not be tax exempt. Situations in which persons are treated as having some control are defined in subsections (5), (6) and (7) of section CW 35 of the Act (see the Appendix). Private pecuniary profit is a criterion for registration and will be looked at by the Charities Commission when making a decision on registration. Where there is the potential for private pecuniary profit it is likely to mean that the organisation would not be registered. However Inland Revenue has a duty to apply the tax legislation and so may, notwithstanding registration, decide whether or not in any particular case the exemption for business income should apply.  
      
    
55.  The section CW 35 tax exemption will not apply if a person having some control of the business has the potential to benefit. It is not necessary for the benefit or advantage to be actually received.  
      
    
56.  In any audit, Inland Revenue will examine the affairs of the entity including any documentation, etc. The documentation of charitable entities (trust deeds or constitutions, etc) will be examined to ensure that no person with some control over the business is able to exert influence that would enable that person to receive a benefit or advantage. A determination has to be made as to whether a benefit is gained or is able to be gained by a person (who has some control of the business) were it not for the influence of that person. The person's legal as well as practical ability to influence will be examined (CIR v Dick (2001) 20 NZTC 17,396).  
      
    
57.  There is a wide spectrum of situations in which a person may be able to exercise some control over a business. At one extreme would be situations of duress or oppressive conduct, or where the person controls the decision making in terms of majority voting rights, or with associated persons controls the board or where the trust instrument grants a right of veto over decisions to that person. At the other end of the spectrum are cases where the settlor is consulted but has no power to direct, or the person in question is only one of a number of trustees or directors involved in decision making.  
      
    
58.  Whether a person is able to exert material influence is a matter of fact and degree. It will depend upon the facts, the particular arrangement, the degree of relationship of the parties, the documentation of the charitable entity and the way it makes its decisions.  
      
    
59.  Where there is a sole trustee, it would be implied that the sole trustee would be able to exert the requisite influence.  
      
    
60.  In instances where there are two or more persons that are able to influence a decision, whether a person is able to materially influence may depend on whether the person actually participates in the discussion and decision making. Even if in a minority on the decision making group, material influence could still be exerted. For example, a person whose advice is well regarded by the trustees is able to influence the other trustees to his/her own advantage.  
      
    
61.  The past behaviour of the entity, that is, the pattern of distributions or whether any benefits have been afforded at any time to any person who is able to influence the entity by virtue of his or her status, can be a guide as to whether in practice the person in question is able to materially influence the setting of benefits. For example, in CIR v Dick Glazebrook J stated (paragraph 65) that:  
    
    > In the situation where benefits and income have never been accorded and where the practice has been to utilise any surplus for the charitable objects of a trust it would not be reasonable for the Commissioner to take the view that any of the persons having the requisite capacities were for those income years able to influence materially the amount of benefits or income.
    
62.  Adequate records (e.g. minutes of meetings) will have to be kept to show how decisions were made.  
      
    
63.  Companies that are in business are in some cases subject to rights granted to shareholders and directors under the Companies Act 1993. Where such rights enable a person to influence the decisions of a business, so that the person obtains a benefit, or is able to obtain a benefit or advantage, the income derived from that business will not be exempt from tax. Special provisions may be required eliminating such powers that enable a person to influence company decisions.  
    

##### Benefit or Advantage  
  

64.  A benefit or advantage that is received or is able to be received by a person is defined widely in section CW 35(8) of the Act.  
      
    
65.  Where a person in some control of a business receives any one of these benefits, or any other amount covered by subsection (1)(b), the section CW 35 business income exemption does not apply. Something acquired through the provision of services or goods at market value is not considered to be a benefit or advantage.  
      
    
66.  Where a person is able to materially influence a benefit or advantage while providing professional services to the trust or company by which the business is carried on and they provide the services in the course of a professional public practice, or as a trustee company, or the Public Trust or Maori Trustee, that person is deemed not to have control over the trust or the company for their own benefit (subsection CW 35(7)). The term company includes a society or institution.  
      
    
67.  Furthermore, where it is clear that the setting of any benefit or advantage has been undertaken in a scientific manner to ensure that no more than market value is paid Inland Revenue will accept that there was no material influence ( CIR v Dick (2001) 20 NZTC 17,396).

##### Donee organisations  
  

68.  Section KC 5 provides for a tax rebate in respect of donations of money of $5 or more to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund, the funds of which are, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, applied wholly or principally to any charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand. Entities given approval are known as donee organisations or as having donee status. Note, the rebate does not apply to certain bodies including Public Authorities and Maori Authorities.  
      
    
69.  Section DB 32 provides that a company (not being a close company unless its shares are listed on a recognised exchange) may claim a deduction for gifts of money to these organisations. The deduction for all gifts made in a tax year is limited to 5% of the amount that would otherwise be the company's net income in the tax year. A similar deduction is allowed under section DV 11 to a Maori authority for donations made to any Maori association (as defined in the Maori Community Development Act 1962 for the purposes of that Act) or to donee organisations.  
      
    
70.  In order to determine whether a rebate can properly be claimed, Inland Revenue needs to consider whether the society, etc. is of a kind referred to in section KC 5 of the Act. The information contained in the application for registration of the society as a charitable entity will assist in this process.  
      
    
71.  Approval as a donee organisation does not necessarily carry an implication of charity. This is because section KC 5 also applies to benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes. Applications for approval as a donee organisation under these other grounds should continue to be sent directly to Inland Revenue. Approval as a benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural organisation does not imply that the organisation is accepted as a charity. However, in most cases charitable organisations would qualify as donee organisations.  
      
    
72.  Where an approved donee organisation applies funds for purposes both within and outside New Zealand it is advisable that the use of the funds in and outside New Zealand be separately recorded within the accounting records.  
      
    
73.  The entity will also need to show in its constituting documents that its funds will be applied wholly or principally within New Zealand. Should an audit later be conducted then the entity must also be able to show that it has complied with the relevant requirements of section KC 5.  
      
    
74.  An organisation whose funds will be applied mainly overseas would need to approach the Government via Inland Revenue for legislation enabling it to be specifically included in the list of donee organisations. This is because of the express limitation in section KC 5 itself that the funds must be applied principally for charitable purposes within New Zealand.  
      
    
75.  For those organisations applying funds mainly overseas Cabinet will only consider, for inclusion within section KC5, organisations whose funds are principally applied towards:  
      
    1.  the relief of poverty, hunger, sickness or the ravages of war or natural disaster; or  
        
    2.  the economy of developing countries (recognised as such by the United Nations); or  
        
    3.  raising the educational standards of a developing country.

> Specifically excluded are charities formed for the principal purpose of fostering or administering any religion, cult or political creed.  
>   
> When forwarding your application to Inland Revenue it would be helpful if it is supported with the following:
> 
> 1.  an indication of the amount of donations likely to be received in any year;  
>     
> 2.  an indication of the proportion of annual income which is likely to be applied to charitable purposes outside New Zealand ; and  
>     
> 3.  any other information which you would like used to support your case.

##### Receipts  
  

76.  To qualify for the rebate a person must produce a receipt from the approved donee that meets the following criteria:

*   be officially stamped with the name of the approved donee or branch of the organisation,  
    
*   clearly indicate that it is a donation and the amount,  
    
*   show the date the donation was received, and  
    
*   be signed by a person authorised by the approved donee to accept donations.

##### Resident withholding tax  
  

77.  Certificates of exemption from resident withholding tax (RWT) are issued to, among others, persons who derive exempt income under section CW 34 Charities: non-business income, section CW 35 Charities: business income and section CW 36 Charitable bequests of the Act. Where these persons or entities claim to be charities then they will need to register with the Charities Commission. O n becoming registered entities may apply to Inland Revenue for certificates of exemption. Inland Revenue will accept registration with the Commission as proof that they are charitable.  
      
    
78.  In the transitional period from 1 February 2007 until 30 June 2008 Inland Revenue will accept applications for exemption without evidence of registration or tax exempt status. However, after 30 June 2008 these entities will be checked and if they have not registered they must return their income in their annual income tax returns. Any exemption certificates will be cancelled.

> _Record keeping_

79.  Under section 32 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 all gift-exempt bodies must keep sufficient records in the English language to enable Inland Revenue to determine both the sources of donations and the application, within New Zealand or within a country or territory outside New Zealand, of their funds. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue may, however, authorise a gift-exempt body to keep those records in a language other than English if the gift-exempt body applies in writing to the Commissioner for the authorisation.  
      
    
80.  Section 58 of the Tax Administration Act provides that every gift-exempt body may be required to furnish, if requested, a return of its funds derived or received in any tax year and showing the source and application of those funds.

> _Alterations to the founding documents_

81.  In the past Inland Revenue has suggested that organisations have clauses in their founding documents which restrict them from altering certain clauses without prior approval from the Commissioner. The relevant clauses would be those defining the charitable purposes or objects, the clause relating to personal advantage, the rule change clause and the winding up clause. Inland Revenue will no longer give prior approval to clause changes and strongly recommends that organisations remove any such requirement in their rules. To enable this to happen, Inland Revenue hereby consents to an amendment removing any such rule.  
      
    
82.  The Charities Commission will however require any rule changes to be notified to them within 3 months after the changes have been made to ensure that a charity retains its registration. The Commission will not review draft documents including draft amendments to an entity's objects and rules. Where such a change is made the executed documents should be filed with the Commission.

This Operational Statement is signed on 14th of November 2006.

Commissioner's statement of a mileage rate for expenditure incurred for the business use of a motor vehicle
===========================================================================================================

2009 review of the CIR's mileage rate for expenditure incurred for business use of a motor vehicle sets the rate at 70 cents per km for petrol and diesel vehicles.

This statement may be cited as "Operational Statement 09/01: _Commissioner's statement of a mileage rate for expenditure incurred for the business use of a motor vehicle_".

### Introduction

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007.

Under section DE 3 a self-employed person may use one of three methods to calculate the proportion of business use of a motor vehicle, namely:

*   actual records
*   a logbook, or
*   a mileage rate.

Section DE 12(3) requires that the Commissioner sets a mileage rate that taxpayers may use to calculate the expenditure or loss on a motor vehicle that represents the proportion of business use of a motor vehicle. This statement sets a mileage rate as required by section DE 12(3).

### Application

##### _Self-employed_

The mileage rate applies in respect of:

*   self-employed taxpayers
*   up to a maximum of 5,000 kilometres of work-related travel each year
*   motor vehicles irrespective of engine size whether they are powered by petrol or diesel.

The mileage rate applies from the 2008-2009 income year.

The mileage rate does not apply in respect of motor cycles.

##### _Employee reimbursement_

The mileage rate may be used as a reasonable estimate by employers reimbursing employees for:

*   business use of an employee's vehicle, and
*   shareholder employees.

### Mileage rate

Under section DE 12(3) the mileage rate set by this statement for motor vehicles is 70 cents per kilometre.

**Rob Wells**  
LTS Manager, Technical Standards

* * *

### Background (not part of the Operational Statement)

Section DE 12(3) requires that the Commissioner must from time to time set and publish a mileage rate. The above rate is based on information obtained from a survey of the running costs of petrol and diesel vehicles across a range of engine sizes.

It includes the cost of repairs and maintenance, purchase prices and the cost of fuel ($1.58 and $0.98 per litre for 91 octane petrol and diesel respectively) and is based on 14,000 kilometres of travel per year.

It is noted that the price of fuel is only one component that is considered in the setting of the above mileage rate. Calculations show that fluctuations in the price of fuel have only a small influence on the overall mileage rate. Therefore, it will not be necessary to review this mileage rate each time there is a change in the price of fuel. However, Inland Revenue will continue to monitor fuel prices and issue a revised mileage rate where appropriate. Such a review will also be done at least once a year.

Based on this information, the Commissioner has arrived at a weighted average figure that applies in respect of both petrol and diesel motor vehicles.

### Alternative methods for the self-employed

Section DE 3 provides three methods for calculating the business use, namely actual records (section DE 5), a logbook (sections DE 6 to DE 11) and a mileage rate (section DE 12). Therefore those in self-employment may also use either of the following two methods, ie they may calculate their actual business-related expenditure or use the logbook method. If their business-related travel is over 5,000 kilometres then they must use one of these methods.

#### _Actual expenditure (section DE 5)_

Instead of using the above mileage rate a self-employed person may claim deductions for the actual expenditure they incur and an amount of depreciation loss for the business use of their motor vehicle. If you do this then you must make sure that you keep accurate records to determine the proportion of business use. Those records will need to show the reasons for and the distance of journeys by a motor vehicle for business purposes.

#### _Logbook method (sections DE 6 to DE 11)_

Alternatively, to establish the proportion of business use of a motor vehicle, a person may keep a logbook for a test period of at least 90 consecutive days. 

The log book test period is used to establish the average proportion of travel by the vehicle for business purposes during the logbook term. Taxpayers may then apply that proportion for the logbook term (up to three years) to calculate the deduction for the expenditure that they incur and the amount of depreciation loss for the business use of the motor vehicle.

The logbook must record:

*   the start and end of the 90 day test period; and
*   the vehicle's odometer readings at the start and end of the test period; and
*   the distance of each business journey; and
*   the date of each business journey; and
*   the reason for each business journey; and
*   any other detail that the Commissioner may require.

### Employee reimbursement

Section CW 17(2) provides an exemption for an amount that an employer pays to an employee as reimbursement of expenditure incurred by the employee in connection with the employee's employment or service. Employers may reimburse the employee based on the actual expenditure incurred by that employee. Alternatively, section CW 17(3) provides that an employer may make a reasonable estimate of the amount of expenditure likely to be incurred by an employee or group of employees.

The Commissioner accepts that employers may regard the mileage rate set out above when reimbursing employees under section CW 17(2) as being a reasonable estimate under section CW 17(3).

#### _Shareholder-employees_

Where shareholder-employees meet the employee criteria, they may be reimbursed using the mileage rate as a reasonable estimate.

### Supplementary questions and answers to Operational Statement  
OS: 09/01 Commissioner’s statement of a mileage rate for expenditure incurred for the business use of a motor vehicle

**Question 1:** The OS states that the Commissioner’s mileage rate applies from the 2008-2009 income year. Does this mean that the mileage rate applies from 1 April 2008 even though the statement was not issued until May 2009?

**Reply:** Yes; for taxpayers with a standard balance date of 31 March OS 09/01 applies from 1 April 2008. Section DE 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“the Act”) allows taxpayers to calculate the proportion of business use of a motor vehicle using actual records, a log book or using a mileage rate. Section DE 12(3) requires the Commissioner to set a mileage rate. OS 09/01 was published when many self employed taxpayers were in the process of having returns of income prepared for the year ended 31 March 2009.

**Question 2:** The OS sets a mileage rate of 70 cents per kilometre. However, previous mileage rates set by Inland Revenue included both a banded rate (62 cents per km for 0 – 3,000km, then 19 cent/km for each km over 3,000km) as well as a flat rate of 28 cents/km. OS 09/01 sets one mileage rate of 70 cents per km. We have been asked what rate self –employed taxpayers should use where their business mileage exceeds 5,000km for the income year. Also no mention has been made of what is happening with motor cycle reimbursing rates or special individual rates. Can you please advise what is happening to the other rates, and how all those other rates will apply? Further, have the individual special rates changed?

**Reply:** Previous mileage rates sets by Inland Revenue were issued as a compliance cost reduction initiative, but there was no underlying statutory authority for setting those rates, nor were taxpayers compelled to use those rates. Section DE 12(3) now requires the Commissioner to set and publish a mileage rate. However section DE 12(1) provides that a mileage rate can only apply where a person’s business travel is 5,000km or less in an income year. Therefore, the Commissioner’s mileage rate can only be used by self-employed taxpayers whose annual business travel is 5,000km or less. Self-employed taxpayers whose annual business travel exceeds 5,000km will need to use actual costs. OS 09/01 replaces any previous published statement by the Commissioner on motor vehicle mileage rates, and as a consequence the other rates cease to apply from the 2009 income year onwards.

No mileage rate has been set for motorcycles as this mode of transport is not commonly used for business purposes. Any self employed persons who use a motor cycle for business purposes will need to calculate their actual expenditure or in the situation of an employer reimbursement, they may make a reasonable estimate of the employee’s costs.

Individual special rates were in effect employer estimates using a formula developed by Inland Revenue. Employers may continue to use their reasonable estimate, and do not require Inland Revenue’s approval.

**Question 3:** Does the 5,000km limitation for self-employed taxpayers apply to employer reimbursements? Will this also apply to shareholder-employee reimbursements?

**Reply:** Section CW 17 provides that an employer may reimburse an employee for expenditure incurred by that employee on the employer’s behalf and that reimbursement is exempt income to the extent to which it is a reimbursement. Section CW 17(3) allows the employer to make a reasonable estimate of the expenditure likely to be incurred by the employee (or group of employees). Having set the mileage rate in OS 09/01, the Commissioner accepts that employers may use this as being a reasonable estimate of motor vehicle running costs when reimbursing employees for the business use of an employee's motor vehicle. The 5,000km limit provided in section DE 12(1) does not extend to employers using the mileage rate to reimburse employees. Although this will mean that employers may use the mileage rate to reimburse employees where the employee’s business travel exceeds 5,000km, it should also be borne in mind that section CW 17(3) does require a reasonable estimate of the expenditure likely to be incurred by the employee and that the exemption provided in section CW 17(2) only applies “to the extent to which it reimburses the employee for expenditure for which the employee would be allowed a deduction if the employment limitation did not exist

Shareholder-employees may also use the mileage rate for reimbursements related to business use of a motor vehicle. Similarly, the 5,000km limit does not apply to reimbursements to shareholder-employees but we reiterate that any reimbursement should based on a reasonable estimate of expenditure.

**Question 4:** When will the Commissioner review the mileage rate again, to reflect fuel price fluctuations?

**Reply:** Inland Revenue will not be amending the rate for every change in the price of fuel. We have been advised, and research confirms, that the price of fuel has only a marginal effect on the overall cost of owning, maintaining and running a motor vehicle. It takes a considerable movement in the price of fuel to change the mileage rate by even 1 cent. We want to avoid any increase to compliance costs by setting different tax rates for one income year that could cause confusion for taxpayers and increase resource costs for Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue will monitor fuel prices and publish a rate at least once a year.

Taxpayers are not obliged to use the Commissioner’s mileage rate. They can still use actual costs if they consider that the Commissioner’s mileage rate does not reflect their true costs.

This statement also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol. 25, No. 8 (September 2013).

#### Introduction

1.  This statement outlines how Inland Revenue will exercise one of the Commissioner's information gathering powers: the search powers under sections 16, 16B and 16C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Search and Surveillance Act 2012. The statement aims to provide taxpayers and their advisers with information about what to expect when the Commissioner uses these powers, and the Commissioner's expectations of taxpayers.
2.  This Operational Statement is supplemented by the Standard Practice Statement 10/02 _Imaging of electronic storage media_ (or any subsequent replacements of this SPS) and is to be read in conjunction with that SPS.
3.  Legislative references within this Operational Statement are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated.

#### Application

4.  This Operational Statement applies from 1 September 2013.

#### Summary

5.  Under section 16 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) and Part Four of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 (SSA) the Commissioner, or any authorised Inland Revenue officer, has powers to fully and freely access places and documents for the purpose of inspecting any documents, property, process or matter which are considered necessary or relevant for the purpose of collecting any tax or carrying out any function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner.
6.  These powers are granted to the Commissioner to enable her to carry out her statutory duties. These duties include those set out in sections 6 and 6A, to protect the integrity of the tax system and to collect over time the highest net revenue practicable within the law, having regard to the Commissioner's resources, the importance of promoting compliance and the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers.
7.  Sections 16B and 16C support these powers of access by enabling the Commissioner to remove documents for copying and/or full and complete inspection.
8.  Section 16(1) is a warrantless power of entry. This means that, except for private dwellings, the Commissioner does not need to obtain a warrant to access all lands, buildings and places and to all documents.
9.  In order to access a private dwelling, the Commissioner must obtain either:  
    (a) a warrant under section 16(4); or  
    (b) the consent of an occupier.
10.  The Commissioner can remove documents, including electronically stored information, and retain them for copying or inspection or both. In order to remove documents from any place, for inspection, the Commissioner must obtain either:  
    (a) a warrant under section 16C(2); or  
    (b) the consent of an occupier.
11.  Warrants can only be obtained from District Court Judges, Judges of the High Court, or from other issuing officers that have been authorised by the Attorney-General (refer to the definition of "issuing officer" in the SSA and to section 108 of the SSA: other issuing officers can include Registrars, Deputy Registrars, Community Magistrates and Justices of the Peace when authorised by the Attorney-General).
12.  Information used for warrant applications will be confidential until, in most cases, the conclusion of the investigation and any litigation.
13.  Inland Revenue officers will apply best practice in using these search powers, including following these guidelines, to ensure compliance with sections 4, 5, 6, 21 and 22 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (Bill of Rights Act).
14.  The SSA provides a number of clarifications to the Commissioner's powers, as well as setting out requirements for Inland Revenue officers and taxpayers to follow. The SSA also sets out the process by which warrants are obtained.
15.  This Operational Statement (OS) provides taxpayers and their advisers with information about what to expect when the Commissioner exercises her search powers, including information on the protocols the Commissioner will follow in relation to legal privilege and the non-disclosure right under sections 20 and 20B to 20G of the TAA. This OS also provides information on the Commissioner's expectations of taxpayers and their advisers, and what the legislation requires them to do.
16.  The Commissioner's search powers will generally be exercised when, in the Commissioner's opinion, other means of obtaining information are inappropriate or inadequate. Other information gathering powers do not have to be used before the Commissioner exercises the section 16 search powers, but these search powers could be exercised in conjunction with those other information-gathering powers.
17.  Occupiers of places accessed by the Commissioner under section 16 are required by section 16(2) to assist the Commissioner by providing all reasonable facilities and assistance for the effective exercise of section 16, and to answer all proper questions relating to that exercise. Inland Revenue officers can use reasonable force, including the services of a locksmith, where necessary to open property, such as locked doors and cabinets.
18.  When documents are removed, owners will be provided with the opportunity to inspect and copy documents at the Inland Revenue office to which the documents are taken. And where practicable, Inland Revenue officers will follow a standard process in relation to the protections in section 20 (legal privilege) and sections 20B to 20G (non-disclosure right).
19.  Occupiers and other taxpayers who take steps to destroy documents or who fail to assist as required under section 16, or otherwise obstruct the Commissioner, could be liable to prosecution under the TAA and SSA. The penalties for such offences range from fines to sentences of imprisonment.
20.  The Commissioner considers the powers provided in sections 16, 16B and 16C to be essential to Inland Revenue's compliance functions and duties under the Revenue Acts. These powers will be exercised responsibly, preserving legal privilege and non-disclosure rights of taxpayers (and others), and in compliance with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act where applicable.

#### Legislation

21.  The following legislative provisions are relevant to this OS:  
    (a) Sections 6, 21, 22, 23 and 28 of the Bill of Rights Act.  
    (b) Sections 16, 16B and 16C of the TAA.  
    (c) Section 20 of the TAA (the legal privilege applying to information subject to the information-gathering powers in sections 16, 17, 17A, 18 and 19).  
    (d) Sections 20B to 20G of the TAA (the non-disclosure right for tax advice documents subject to the information-gathering powers in sections 16, 17, 17A, 18 and 19).  
    (e) Section 3, subparts 1, 3, 4, 7, 9 and 10 of Part 4 (except sections 102, 103(3)(b)(ii), 103(7), 115(1)(b), 118, 119 and 130(4)), and the Schedule of the SSA.  
    (f) Section 60 of the Evidence Act 2006 (EA 2006).

**Search and Surveillance Act 2012**

22.  The SSA aims to ensure search and surveillance powers are exercised consistently and in ways which balance law enforcement priorities with civil rights.
23.  The powers in the TAA are supplemented by various provisions of the SSA. These include clarifications to the Commissioner's powers, requirements for Inland Revenue officers and taxpayers to follow, and the process by which warrants are obtained.
24.  Not all of the provisions in the SSA apply to the Commissioner. Refer to Appendix I for a table summarising the parts of the SSA that apply (including an explanation of how only those parts of the SSA that are listed in the SSA Schedule apply).
25.  The SSA takes effect on the TAA from the earlier of the date of effect given by any Order in Council for the application of the SSA to the TAA, or 1 April 2014.
26.  Refer to Appendix I for an explanation of how the SSA applies to the TAA.

> The term occupier is not defined in the TAA. For the purposes of sections 16 and 16C, the term is given a wide meaning. It includes all persons entitled to be on the premises, including employees, tenants and family members, and is not restricted to the owner or lease holder. This may or may not include the taxpayer under investigation. In this OS, the term "occupier" is used interchangeably with "taxpayer." The Inland Revenue officer in charge will take reasonable measures to satisfy themselves that the occupier they are dealing with has lawful occupation of the place and is the appropriate person to deal with, and may also require other occupiers to provide assistance or answer proper questions. See also paragraphs 53(a) and 112.

_**Private dwelling**_

> Section 16(7) of the TAA defines this as follows:
> 
> *   "**private dwelling**" means any building or part of a building occupied as residential accommodation (including any garage, shed, and other building used in connection therewith); and includes any business premises that are or are within a private dwelling.

_**Proper questions**_

> This term is not defined in the TAA. For the purposes of section 16(2)(b), proper questions are those relating to the effective exercise of powers under section 16. This does not include investigative questions, but can include dual purpose questions (where discussion about documents, property, processes or other matters contained on the premises can overlap with the substantive investigation). See paragraphs 78 to 94 below for a discussion of how these will be managed.

_**Reasonable facilities and assistance**_

> This term is not defined in the TAA. For the purposes of section 16(2)(a), the provision of reasonable facilities and assistance means such assistance as the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the search considers necessary for the effective exercise of the search powers. This is reinforced by the SSA, and examples include unlocking cabinets, providing access to bathroom and kitchen facilities, the provision of electricity, and remaining outside specified areas when required to do so (see paragraphs 97 to 99 below).

_**Remote access search**_

> Section 3 of the SSA defines this as follows:
> 
> *   **remote access search** means a search of a thing such as an Internet data storage facility that does not have a physical address that a person can enter and search

_**Search power**_

> Section 3 of the SSA defines this as follows:
> 
> **search power**, in relation to any provision in this Act, means –  
> (a) every search warrant issued under this Act or an enactment set out in column 2 of the Schedule to which that provision is applied; and  
> (b) every power conferred under this Act or an enactment set out in column 2 of the Schedule to which that provision is applied, to enter and search, or enter and inspect or examine (without warrant) any place, vehicle, or other thing, or to search a person
> 
> The power in section 16, including the power to access private dwellings under warrant, is a search power for the purposes of the SSA.

#### Operational practice

**Overview**

28.  This section sets out the operational practice authorised Inland Revenue officers will follow when exercising search powers, the Commissioner's expectations of taxpayer and their advisers, and their statutory obligations.
29.  This section covers the following matters:
    1.  When Inland Revenue will use section 16.
    2.  Warrants.
    3.  Entry, Identification and Advice of Rights.
    4.  Exercising search powers (including taxpayers' obligations):
        1.  Access;
        2.  Search:
        3.  Assistants;
        4.  Reasonable facilities and assistance;
        5.  Proper questions;
        6.  Power to exclude;
        7.  (vii) Other activities;
        8.  Electronically stored information;
        9.  Removal of documents.
    5.  Legal advisers, tax agents and support persons.
    6.  Legal privilege and the non-disclosure right.
    7.  After the search:
        1.  Access to documents;
        2.  Return of documents.
    8.  Offences.

**When Inland Revenue will use section 16**

30.  The efficient and effective use of information gathering powers such as those provided in sections 16, 16B and 16C are necessary for the Commissioner to obtain information to verify various tax liabilities, to deter and detect offending, and to assist in tax collection.
31.  The Commissioner will use section 16 where it is considered appropriate in the context of the particular investigation, and where it is reasonable. This includes cases where, in the Commissioner's opinion, there is a risk or history of non-compliance and/or a lack of co-operation, where it is likely that documents may be at risk, or likely that the case involves revenue offending (tax crimes, including fraud and evasion). Section 16 can also be used to address problems of aggressive tax planning and tax avoidance.
32.  It is not necessary for the Commissioner to use other avenues to obtain the information or other powers, such as section 17, before exercising section 16.
33.  The power under section 16B will be exercised in situations where it is considered reasonable to do so in order to prevent the Commissioner's investigations being hindered or where copying of the documents on the premises is not practicable.
34.  The powers under section 16C will be exercised when it is reasonable to do so to retain documents for full and complete inspection, including the use of those original documents in court proceedings.
35.  The Commissioner recognises the intrusive nature of the exercise of section 16, and the need to use section 16 in a way that recognises the importance of the rights and entitlements affirmed in other enactments, including the Bill of Rights Act, the Privacy Act 1993 and the Evidence Act 2006, while ensuring the effectiveness of the Commissioner's investigative tools. The Inland Revenue officer in charge will explain clearly to occupiers what their rights and obligations are (see paragraphs 49 and 57 to 59).

**Warrants**

36.  Section 16(1) is a warrantless power of entry. This means the Commissioner does not need to obtain a warrant to access all lands, buildings (except for private dwellings) and places, and all documents.
37.  In order to access a private dwelling, the Commissioner must obtain either:
    1.  a warrant under section 16(4); or
    2.  the consent of an occupier.
38.  It is the Commissioner's practice to apply for warrants in relation to accessing private dwellings. This provides occupiers with judicial oversight, helping balance their privacy rights against law enforcement needs. If part of a search area is found to contain a private dwelling, and if a private dwelling warrant is not already held, the officer in charge will seek either the occupier's consent, or a warrant before searching that area.
39.  The Commissioner can remove documents, including electronically stored information, and retain them for copying or inspection or both. In order to remove documents from any place, for inspection, the Commissioner must obtain either:
    
    1.  a warrant under section 16C(2); or
    2.  the consent of an occupier.
    
    *   _Note_: The Commissioner does not require a warrant, or the consent of an occupier, to remove documents for copying (under section 16B). Copying of documents, including the imaging of electronically stored information, can occur either on-site or elsewhere.
40.  The Commissioner will obtain warrants under section 16C to remove and retain documents in most cases where section 16 is being used. Although section 16C states that documents can be removed and retained with the occupier's consent, the Commissioner will generally obtain warrants for the removal of documents under section 16C. In most cases, having a warrant to remove the documents will reduce the amount of time Inland Revenue staff will be present at taxpayers' premises and will provide a clearer framework for claiming and protecting legal privilege and the non-disclosure right.
41.  Subpart 3 of Part 4 of the SSA sets out the process by which warrants are to be obtained. One of those requirements is for the warrant application to contain a description of the items believed to be in the place, vehicle or other thing sought by the Commissioner (section 98(1)(e) of the SSA). Section 103(4)(g) of the SSA requires the warrant itself to contain a description of what may be seized. The Tax Administration (Form of Warrant) Regulations 2003 reflects this requirement, which satisfies the SSA requirements. A more detailed description of the documents to be seized is not required, and in addition, section 123 of the SSA allows Inland Revenue officers to seize other documents that are in plain view during the section 16 search. Section 123 authorises Inland Revenue officers to do this where they have reasonable grounds to believe they could have seized the items under a private dwelling search warrant, a section 16C(2) warrant, or under section 16(1).
42.  Where the Commissioner intends to use section 16 to inspect any property, process or matter (other than documents), then the requirements of sections 98(1) and 103(4)(g) of the SSA to describe the item to be seized do not apply. This is because the requirement to describe items to be seized cannot apply to items that are going to be inspected, not seized.
43.  These warrant applications are made without notice to the occupier, and can include confidential information. Where the relevant secrecy or confidentiality rules apply the Commissioner will generally seek to keep the information confidential. Other information may be disclosed either in whole or part at the conclusion of the investigation and any litigation resulting from that investigation. In some cases, this information may still be protected after the investigation or litigation has ended.
44.  While section 100(3) of the SSA provides for oral applications for warrants, the Commissioner will generally seek warrants by written application.

**Entry, Identification and Advice of Rights**

_Entry_

45.  Section 16(1) provides the Commissioner with wide powers of access to all lands, buildings and places, and documents. This includes motor vehicles, business premises, warehouses, and private dwellings under a court warrant. This is reflected in section 110 of the SSA.
46.  Inland Revenue officers exercising search or seizure powers are able to use reasonable force in respect of any property (for example, to open doors and access cabinets). This is specifically provided for in sections 110(c), 113(2)(b) and 131(3) of the SSA. Those powers do not authorise the use of force against persons.
47.  One example of reasonable force is the use of a locksmith to gain entry if no one is present or if the occupier refuses entry. The use of non-Inland Revenue personnel, such as locksmiths, is also authorised by provisions in the TAA and SSA which permit Inland Revenue officers to bring along such assistants as they consider necessary (see paragraphs 67 to 71 for further discussion). Where locksmiths or other means of reasonable force are used to gain entry, and new locks and/or keys are required, the Inland Revenue officer in charge will attempt to contact the property owner and provide them with the new keys.
48.  The Inland Revenue officer in charge will accompany all assistants when they first enter the place to be searched, and will supervise any assistant that is not an Inland Revenue employee or a Police constable as the Inland Revenue officer in charge considers reasonable in the circumstances.

_Identification and notices_

49.  When entering premises under section 16, the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the search will:
    1.  (a) Announce their intention to enter under section 16.
    2.  Identify him/herself by name or by unique identifier.
    3.  Produce evidence of their identity.
    4.  Provide the occupier with a copy of the search warrant, if any.
    5.  Where the search is not being carried out under a warrant, provide the occupier with a written notice setting out:
        1.  That the search is taking place under section 16; and
        2.  The reason for the search. This will be in general terms describing the nature of the investigation, but not setting out specific detail. For searches being carried out under warrants, the reason for the search is set out in the warrant.
    6.  Accompany any assistant that is not an Inland Revenue employee or a Police constable when that assistant first enters the place.
50.  The Inland Revenue officer in charge will also identify themself to the occupier as the main contact person for the occupier and their adviser during the search of the premises.
51.  If the occupier is not present during the search, the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the access will leave the following in a prominent position at the place (or in the vehicle):
    1.  A copy of the search warrant (where the search was carried out under a search warrant);
    2.  A notice setting out:
        1.  The date and time of the start and finish of the search;
        2.  The name or unique identifier of the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the search;
        3.  Where the search was exercised without a warrant, that it took place under section 16, and the reason for the search;
        4.  The address and contact details of the Inland Revenue officer to whom enquiries should be made;
        5.  If nothing was seized, the fact that nothing was seized;
        6.  If documents were seized, the fact that documents were seized;
        7.  If documents were seized, and where an inventory is not provided at this time, a statement that an inventory will be provided within seven days after the seizure;
        8.  If documents were seized, the information set out in paragraph 112 to the extent applicable.
52.  Where it is not reasonably practicable to take the steps set out in paragraph 49, section 131(4)(b) of the SSA enables the Commissioner to provide this information to the occupier or owner within seven days after the search.
53.  By taking the above steps, the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the search will have met the identification and notice requirements of sections 16(6) and 16C(4) and section 131 of the SSA. However, in the following circumstances, sections 131(1)(b)(ii), 131(2) and 131(6) of the SSA permit the Inland Revenue officer in charge to elect not to carry out some of these requirements:
    1.  Where the Inland Revenue officer in charge has reasonable grounds to believe the person present during the search is not the occupier of the place or is not the person in charge of the vehicle or other thing being searched, the Inland Revenue officer in charge will not provide that occupier with the information in paragraphs 49 and 51;
    2.  Where it is impracticable to do so, the Inland Revenue officer in charge can elect not to carry out paragraphs 49(d) and (e);
    3.  Where there are operational reasons (such as safety or prejudice to the investigation or the access), the Inland Revenue officer in charge can elect not to carry out paragraph 49; and
    4.  Where the Inland Revenue officer in charge has reasonable grounds to believe that no person is lawfully present, then they can elect not to carry out paragraph 49.
54.  In the following circumstances, section 134 of the SSA enables Inland Revenue to apply to a Judge for a postponement of the requirements in paragraph 51:
    1.  Where compliance would endanger the safety of a person; or
    2.  Where compliance would prejudice on-going investigations.
55.  Section 132 of the SSA sets out identification and notice requirements for remote access searches. In addition to remote access searching, the Commissioner is also able to access computer systems under section 16(1) because of the broad nature of the language used in that section.
56.  To ensure the Commissioner’s powers in this regard are exercised in a reasonable manner, and consistently with the Bill of Rights Act, the Inland Revenue officer in charge will, if possible, do the following upon completion of a computer system search:
    1.  send an electronic message to the email address of the thing searched setting out:
        1.  The date and time of the start and finish of the search;
        2.  The name or unique identifier of the Inland revenue officer in charge of the search;
        3.  The address of the Inland Revenue office to which inquiries should be made.
    2.  Where it is not possible to deliver this electronic message, the Inland Revenue officer in charge will take reasonable steps to identify the user of the thing searched and send the above information to them.

_Advice of rights_

57.  The Commissioner's use of section 16 is subject to the reasonableness requirement of section 21 of the Bill of Rights Act.
58.  To ensure the search powers in the TAA and the SSA are exercised consistently with the protections in the Bill of Rights Act, the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the search will provide the occupier with the following:
    1.  Advice of the occupier's ability to consult and instruct a lawyer.
    2.  An explanation of the occupier's obligation to provide reasonable facilities and assistance and to answer proper questions.
    3.  An explanation of the privilege against self-incrimination under section 60 of the Evidence Act, where proper questions are being asked that may also constitute investigative questions (refer to paragraphs 78 to 94 for more information on proper questions).
    4.  A general explanation of the processes that will be undertaken on-site.
59.  The Inland Revenue officer in charge of the search will provide the occupier with a written copy of the above information.

**Exercising search powers (including taxpayers' obligations)**

_Access_

60.  Access will be undertaken at a time the Commissioner considers will balance causing minimal disruption to the occupier with the purpose of the search and the operational needs of the investigation.
61.  Where no-one is present at the premises being searched, Inland Revenue officers are able to use reasonable force to gain access.  This includes forced entry or engaging the services of a locksmith to enter the premises, and disarming alarms.

_Search_

62.  The power of access in section 16 includes the power to search for items covered by that section.
63.  Noting the restrictions set out in the SSA, the Commissioner's view is that officers are not empowered to directly search persons.However, occupiers are required to provide Inland Revenue staff with reasonable facilities and assistance in carrying out the search.This includes emptying their pockets if asked to do so, handing over documents and devices such as cellphones or USB drives, and allowing the Inland Revenue officer to search inside items such as handbags, briefcases and backpacks.
64.  Where Inland Revenue officers have reasonable grounds to believe that documents, including electronically stored information, are on an occupier's person, Inland Revenue officers may request the assistance of Police to search that person where the Police powers to do so apply.Where Police are called on to assist IR officers, any constable is able to exercise any power ordinarily exercisable by them (section 113(3) of the SSA).
65.  Any such search of a person will be conducted with decency and sensitivity and in a manner that affords to the person being searched, the degree of privacy and dignity that is consistent with achieving the purpose of the search (as set out in the SSA).
66.  The search may extend to any item the person is carrying or that is in the person's physical possession or immediate control (including briefcases, handbags and backpacks).

_Assistants_

67.  Section 16(2A) authorises Inland Revenue to bring such assistants as the Commissioner may consider necessary, and section 113(4) of the SSA sets out the Commissioner's obligations in relation to those assistants.Examples of assistants include other Inland Revenue staff, digital or other computer forensic experts, locksmiths, Police officers, dog control officers, interpreters, landlords and local council staff.
68.  Where an assistant is not an Inland Revenue employee or a Police constable, the Inland Revenue officer in charge will accompany that assistant when they first enter the place to be searched, and provide such supervision as is reasonably necessary.Where the assistant is a constable, section 113(5) of the SSA makes it clear that these requirements do not apply.
69.  Assistants have all of the powers given to them under section 113 of the SSA that the Inland Revenue officer in charge authorises them to use.This includes authorising an assistant to use reasonable measures to access computer systems, and authorising locksmiths to use reasonable force in respect of any property.
70.  Assistants can also be used where occupiers are obstructing entry or the search and seizure.Inland Revenue can call on the assistance of Police or other security specialists.
71.  Where the Commissioner has engaged the services of non-Inland Revenue staff to assist in the exercise of section 16, they will be required to have first signed a declaration of secrecy under section 87.

_Reasonable facilities and assistance_

72.  The Commissioner's search of premises requires some degree of assistance from those in normal possession of those premises, including unlocking doors and providing electricity.Section 16(2) requires occupiers to provide reasonable facilities and assistance to Inland Revenue officers.
73.  Refer to paragraph 58 for further information as to what occupiers will be told.
74.  The obligations to answer proper questions and provide assistance under section 16(2) do not amount to a detention within the meaning of section 23 of the Bill of Rights Act.However, occupiers will be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the person, as set out in section 23(5) of the Bill of Rights Act.
75.  Where occupiers are required to provide assistance, they will be asked to do so at an early stage. Wherever possible, the Inland Revenue officer in charge will avoid keeping occupiers longer than is necessary for them to assist during the course of the search.
76.  When requiring assistance from occupiers, Inland Revenue will take into account the following factors:
    1.  The compliance cost to the occupier;
    2.  The need for occupiers to also meet the needs of their business during the search (where the search occurs during that business' working hours);and
    3.  The purpose for which the search powers are being exercised.
77.  Where the occupier is required to provide assistance, the Inland Revenue officer in charge will inform them of the reason for this, and that they have the right to refrain from making any incriminating statement (unless it is a proper question within the parameters discussed in paragraphs 78 to 94).

_Proper questions_

78.  When the search power in section 16 is being exercised Inland Revenue staff are statutorily empowered under section 16(2)(b) to ask questions which occupiers must answer.
79.  The SSA also imposes additional obligations on occupiers to provide access or other information that is reasonable and necessary to allow Inland Revenue to access data in computer systems or other data storage devices or internet sites (section 130 of the SSA).
80.  The answers to questions asked under section 16(2)(b) can be required in writing or under statutory declaration. Generally, it is the Commissioner's practice to require oral answers to these questions during the search, although the occupier can be asked to provide answers in writing or under a statutory declaration.
81.  Any questions asked under section 16(2)(b) must be "proper" questions. Proper questions are those relating to the effective exercise of powers under section 16:
    1.  This includes basic questions such as name, address and occupation.
    2.  It does not include investigative questions, which are questions directed at obtaining evidence of offending or of the taking of the underlying tax position. Questions of this kind will be put to the occupier separately under a voluntary interview or an inquiry under sections 18 or 19.
82.  However, the Commissioner recognises that discussion about the material contained on the premises can overlap with the substantive investigation. So when asking questions of this dual nature, Inland Revenue officers will ensure occupiers understand that questions relating to investigative aspects form part of a voluntary interview and they may leave after the "proper question" has been answered (see the discussion at paragraphs 88 to 94 about the privilege against self-incrimination).
83.  If an interview is considered necessary, then this will generally be arranged for a date after the search has been completed. Ensuring that any investigative interview is conducted separately from the search will allow the taxpayer time to discuss their circumstances with an advisor and to appropriately obtain advice. Doing so may also allow time for the taxpayer to make a post-notification voluntary disclosure under section 141G(1)(b).

84.  This means that, unless the taxpayer has previously been advised of this, the exercise of section 16 will qualify as notification of a pending or started tax audit or investigation under section 141G(4). Any questions asked during the search under section 16(2)(b) will be confined as much as possible to "proper questions" so that the search does not constitute an interview for the purposes of section 141G(5)(a) or (b). Inland Revenue's view is that any dual purpose questions do not by themselves constitute an "interview" for the purposes of section 141G(5)(a) or (b), providing that the principal purpose of asking that dual purpose question is to ask a proper question.
85.  Although a search will qualify as notification (for the purposes of the voluntary disclosure regime), it will depend on the facts of each case as to whether or not the Commissioner has started the audit or investigation (per the criteria in section 141G). The Commissioner's view is that inspections conducted in the course of the search for the purposes of determining relevance will generally not trigger the criterion in section 141G(5)(b) (unless purely investigative questions arise during the search) .
86.  This means that generally a voluntary disclosure made following the exercise of section 16 (and until the conclusion of the first interview) will be a post-notification disclosure in terms of section 141G(3)(b). Where possible, the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the access will provide the occupier with a letter recording the notification of the start of an audit or investigation. Refer to SPS 09/02 _Voluntary disclosures_ and SPS 07/02 _Notification of a pending audit or investigation_ for more information. The forms for making voluntary disclosures can be found at www.ird.govt.nz (_IR 281 Voluntary disclosure_).
87.  If an occupier refuses to answer a proper question, or leaves without answering it, this could give rise to a prosecution for obstruction (see paragraphs 97 to 99).
88.  However, section 60 of the Evidence Act provides a privilege against self-incrimination where a natural person is required to provide specific information by a person exercising a statutory power or duty. This privilege is reflected in section 130(2) of the SSA, when a person is required to provide access or other information for computer systems.
89.  The privilege only relates to information that would be likely to incriminate the person under New Zealand law for an offence punishable by a fine or imprisonment. It does not relate to liability for shortfall or other civil penalties under the TAA.
90.  Section 60(3) of the Evidence Act restricts this privilege when an enactment removes it either expressly or by necessary implication. Section 16(2)(b) does remove the privilege in relation to "proper questions."
91.  What this means in practice is that Inland Revenue officers may ask questions relevant to the inspection of documents, property, processes or matters and the occupier is compelled to answer them, but these questions will not extend to investigative ones. This practice applies to sections 6 and 28 of the Bill of Rights Act, by giving section 16(2) a meaning consistent with the rights and freedoms in that Act and with the common law right to silence.
92.  Where such questions fall into both categories (dual purpose questions), the Inland Revenue officer will explain that the occupier has a right under section 60 of the Evidence Act not to answer the question if it would be likely to incriminate them. The privilege only relates to information asked of the person; it does not extend to documents. Providing passwords and other computer system and internet access information is not information that is likely to incriminate a person.
93.  Where occupiers are required to answer proper questions, they will be asked to do so during the course of the search, and the Inland Revenue officer in charge will inform them of the reason for this, and that they have the right to refrain from making any statement that may incriminate them.
94.  If an occupier is unsure as to which questions are proper, having a professional tax adviser or lawyer present can assist. However, Inland Revenue does not consider that it is necessary to await the arrival of any adviser before asking any proper question.

_Power to exclude_

95.  Under section 116 of the SSA, the Inland Revenue officer in charge can secure the place or thing being searched, and where the officer has reasonable grounds to believe any person will obstruct or hinder the search (or any other power being exercised during the search), can exclude any person from the place, vehicle or thing.
96.  In practice, this means that occupiers may be asked to remain outside a specified area, to keep away from other occupiers or Inland Revenue officers, or to leave the premises. Failing to do any of these things could result in the occupier being liable to prosecution for obstruction.

_Obstruction and other offending_

97.  Failing to keep away from other occupiers or Inland Revenue officers, or failing to remain outside an area specified by the officer in charge, may constitute an offence under section 143H (obstruction) leading to possible prosecution.
98.  Obstruction also includes failure to provide reasonable facilities and assistance, failure to answer proper questions, hiding or destroying documents (including electronically stored information).
99.  Such activities may also result in the taxpayer having to pay an increased shortfall penalty under section 141K.

_Other Inland Revenue activities_

100.  Inland Revenue officers may also do the following in the course of exercising the Commissioner's search powers under the TAA and SSA:
    1.  Take photographs, sound, or video recordings.
    2.  Record discussions with occupiers.  
        Because these discussions are not an interview (refer to the discussion on "proper questions" at paragraphs 78 to 94), they are not subject to the guidelines in SPS 12/01 _Tape recording Inland Revenue interviews_; and where an interpreter is being used, the discussion will generally be audio-recorded as normal practice to provide an accurate record for both the occupier and the Commissioner. Where taxpayers are being interviewed, this will be conducted separately and is subject to the guidelines in that SPS.
    3.  Question other occupiers who are present (for example, employees, tenants, family members, but not children under 14 years of age).
    4.  Re-enter the premises after the search has been completed, but where this is a private dwelling, only if all items described in the warrant have not been seized or the search was completed within the last four hours or less.
101.  Inland Revenue officers will also take a record of any cash or other valuables found during the search. This includes counting and photographing the items, because such assets could be representative of undeclared income. The items will generally not be seized by Inland Revenue.

_Electronically stored information_

102.  Refer to the following Standard Practice Statements for information on:
    1.  SPS 13/01 _Retention of business records in electronic format, application to store records offshore, and application to keep records in Maori_ (or any subsequent replacement SPS) for guidelines on retaining business records in electronic format.
    2.  SPS 10/02 _Imaging of electronic storage media_ (or any subsequent replacement SPS) for Inland Revenue's practice when taking an image of electronic storage media.
103.  The SSA confirms the Commissioner's approach to imaging of electronically stored information as set out in SPS 10/02.
104.  Sections 110(h) and (i) and sections 113(h) and (i) of the SSA confirm, as did _Avowal Administrative Attorneys Ltd & Ors v District Court at North Shore & Anor_ \[2010\] NZCA 183, that the Commissioner can access, preview and image (clone) electronically stored information. These sections specifically authorise the Commissioner to do the following:
    1.  Use reasonable measures to access computer systems or other data storage devices, whether located in whole or in part at the place being searched;
    2.  To copy any intangible material accessed, including previewing, cloning or other forensic methods;
    3.  To copy material either before or after removal from the premises.
105.  In addition, section 130 of the SSA authorises the Commissioner to require a person with knowledge of a computer system to provide access information and other assistance that is reasonable and necessary to allow Inland Revenue to access data.
106.  Refer to the following paragraphs in this OS for discussion of these relevant aspects:
    1.  Paragraphs 88 to 94 for a discussion of the privilege against self-incrimination.
    2.  Paragraphs 112(d) and 127 to 139 for information on the privileges and confidentialities that apply.
    3.  Paragraphs 55 to 56 above for an explanation of how the notice requirements in the SSA apply to Inland Revenue accessing electronically stored information.
107.  Inland Revenue's Digital Forensics Unit (DFU) is a unit of specialist computer forensic staff that is independent from the Investigations unit. Wherever possible, the Commissioner will use staff from DFU to carry out the access, searching and copying of electronically stored information.
108.  Examples of situations where it might not be possible to use DFU include where the size of the operation means there are not enough DFU staff to attend at every site, and the Commissioner could either contract in external specialists, or require Investigations staff to remove electronic storage devices and deliver them to DFU for imaging. In all of these cases, a clear chain of custody over the electronic storage device will be maintained, and claims of legal privilege and the non-disclosure right (under sections 20 and 20B to 20G) can be made as described in this OS (see paragraphs 136 to 139). DFU will generally take custody and control of electronic storage media removed under either section 16B or 16C.

_Removal of documents_

109.  Inland Revenue officers can remove documents that are necessary or relevant to the investigation. They can be removed for copying under section 16B or for inspection under section 16C. Inland Revenue officers can also remove other documents under section 123 of the SSA, which relates to the seizure of items in plain view.
110.  The power in section 16B to remove documents accessed under section 16 in order to make copies was provided to the Commissioner to address the risk of documents being destroyed, removed or tampered with in certain cases. Section 110(d) of the SSA authorises the Commissioner to seize anything that is the subject of the search, and under section 110(g), to copy any document that may lawfully be seized. Under section 110(i), the Commissioner can copy electronically stored material (this subsection reflects the case law). These sections also provide the Commissioner with an alternative to copying on-site where it is not possible or practicable to do so.
111.  In order to remove documents under section 16C, the Commissioner requires either a warrant or the consent of the occupier. Neither a warrant nor consent is required in order to remove the documents for copying under section 16B.
112.  When documents are seized, and the Inland Revenue officer in charge is satisfied that the documents are owned by the occupier, they will provide the occupier with a notice (or provide one within seven days after the seizure), setting out:
    1.  A general description of what has been seized (the inventory). For example, the number of folders or boxes of documents removed, and the number of hard drives imaged.
    2.  Information about the occupier or owner's right to access the seized documents under sections 16B(4) and 16C(5).
    3.  Information about the occupier or owner's right to apply for access to any document relating to the search warrant application or the exercise of the search power that led to the seizure, as provided for in section 133(2)(a)(ii) of the SSA. Generally, information used in warrant applications will be confidential until the conclusion of the investigation and any litigation.
    4.  Information about the legal privilege and non-disclosure right in sections 20 and 20B to 20G. Note that other categories of privilege in the SSA do not apply to tax matters (refer to the Schedule to the SSA and Appendix I of this OS for an explanation of which parts of the SSA apply to the TAA).
113.  By providing the notice referred to in paragraph 1120, Inland Revenue will have complied with the requirement in section 133 of the SSA to provide an inventory.
114.  If the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the search is satisfied that none of the items seized are owned by the occupier, then this notice will not be provided to the occupier. Where the Inland Revenue officer in charge has reason to believe someone else is the owner of the documents, they will provide a notice to that person within seven days after the seizure. When documents are removed from, for example, a tax agent's office, the notice will be provided to the tax agent, not to each individual client whose records may have been uplifted.
115.  In the following circumstances, section 134 of the SSA enables Inland Revenue to apply to a Judge for a postponement of the requirements in paragraph 112:
    1.  Where compliance would endanger the safety of any person; or
    2.  Where compliance would prejudice on-going investigations.
116.  When the Inland Revenue officer in charge is uncertain of the status of items, they will be removed under section 112 of the SSA. For the purposes of the inventory and notice requirements, the time of seizure will start from when a decision is made as to whether or not the documents are necessary or relevant. If they are not relevant, they have not been seized, and will be returned to the owner or occupier.
117.  In addition, documents or electronic storage devices that relate to other matters the Commissioner needs to investigate can also be removed under section 123 of the SSA (seizure of items in plain view) during the exercise of section 16. Such items will also be subject to the notice and inventory requirements described above.
118.  Documents removed for copying under section 16B will be returned as soon as practicable. Refer to paragraphs 142 to 145 for further information on the return of documents.
119.  Documents removed under section 16C will be retained for as long as necessary for a full and complete inspection. This includes use in court proceedings. If the Commissioner determines that documents removed under section 16B for copying will be required for a full and complete inspection, the Commissioner will either:
    1.  Seek the consent of the occupier; or
    2.  Obtain a warrant under section 16C(2).

**Legal advisers, tax agents and support persons**

120.  The Commissioner considers it preferable to have legal advisers or tax agents present during a search. This assists the occupier, as well as the Commissioner, in several ways. Having advisers present can reduce the amount of time Inland Revenue is present at the premises, reducing business interruption and our presence in the home. It can facilitate the answering of proper questions, assist with the resolution of issues regarding legal privilege and non-disclosure, and may reduce the stress for the occupier.
121.  Inland Revenue encourages occupiers to have a professional adviser present, such as a lawyer, accountant or other tax adviser, and to consult with their advisers in private.
122.  Waiting for legal advisers to arrive can delay the search, and result in Inland Revenue staff being present on the site for longer than necessary. It is the Commissioner's practice to be present on a site for the minimum amount of time necessary to conduct the access, including copying and removal of documents, so as to cause the least disruption to occupiers and businesses that is consistent with achieving the purpose of the search.
123.  Therefore, occupiers will be provided with a reasonable opportunity to contact a legal adviser, and a decision as to when the search will commence will be made by the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the search. Inland Revenue officers do not have to wait until advisers arrive before commencing the search, imaging of electronically stored material, or removal of documents (see paragraphs 127 to 139 for the legal privilege and non-disclosure right process).
124.  Where proceedings have been commenced (for example, an injunction) in relation to the exercise of section 16, section 180(2)(a) of the SSA authorises the Commissioner to continue with the search.
125.  Occupiers may also prefer to have a tax agent or other support person present; however that person's presence must not interfere with the search.
126.  The presence of other support persons will also be at the discretion of the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the search, and will take into account the occupier's particular circumstances, as well as those of the premises and the search (see to paragraphs 95 and 96).

**Legal privilege and the non-disclosure**

127.  For the purposes of the Commissioner's search powers, the only privileges or confidentialities that apply to Inland Revenue's ability to access and seize documents are those provided for in sections 20 to 20G. The privileges and rights to confidentiality in section 102 and in subpart 5 of Part 4 do not apply to the Commissioner's search powers because they have been specifically excluded by the Schedule to the SSA and by sections 20 and 20B. In practice, however, Inland Revenue regards the section 20 privilege as extending to litigation privilege where New Zealand lawyers (as defined by the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006) are involved. For this purpose, litigation privilege is regarded as covering documents created for the dominant purpose of advising or assisting on reasonably apprehended litigation.
128.  Confidential communications between legal practitioners and their clients that meet the criteria under section 20 are privileged from disclosure under section 16. This does not apply to documents made or brought into existence for the purpose of committing or furthering the commission of some illegal or wrongful act (section 20(1)(c)).
129.  Sections 20B to 20G set out the criteria for claiming a non-disclosure right over tax advice documents subject to the information gathering power in section 16. A document is not a tax advice document if it was created for purposes that include committing, or promoting or assisting the committing of, an illegal or wrongful act (section 20B(2)(c)).
130.  But for these limited exceptions, an information holder has the right to not disclose a document that is eligible to be a tax advice document. See Standard Practice Statement 05/07 _Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents_ (or any subsequent replacements of the SPS) for more information.
131.  The Commissioner will adhere to the provisions of sections 20 to 20G regarding legal privilege and the non-disclosure right for tax advice documents when exercising sections 16, 16B and 16C including when imaging electronic storage media.
132.  See Standard Practice Statement 10/02 _Imaging of electronic storage media_ (or any subsequent replacements of the SPS) for more information on the Commissioner's practices when imaging electronic storage media.
133.  As decided in _A Firm of Solicitors v District Court at Auckland_ \[2006\] 1 NZLR 586, the mere removal and imaging of documents that may be legally privileged or subject to the non-disclosure right, does not breach that right or privilege, because there is no disclosure of those documents. This is confirmed by sections 110(h) and (i) and sections 113(2)(h) and (i) of the SSA which specifically authorise the accessing, previewing and cloning of intangible material in computer systems or other data storage devices.
134.  The Commissioner is not responsible for asserting privilege or the non-disclosure right for taxpayers, but will advise occupiers of these rights where documents potentially subject to privilege or the non-disclosure right under sections 20 and 20B to 20G are anticipated.
135.  A blanket claim of legal privilege or of the non-disclosure right across all documents is not a valid claim. As set out in the process below (paragraph 136), the Commissioner will provide an adequate opportunity for the owner of hard copy documents to review the documents to enable particularised claims to be made within a reasonable timeframe.
136.  Where practical, Inland Revenue officers will use the following process in relation to section 20 (legal privilege) and sections 20B to 20G (the non-disclosure right):
    
    1.  Provide the occupier with the opportunity to seek advice and make particularised claims under section 20 and sections 20B to 20G.
    2.  In relation to electronically stored documents that are potentially subject to legal privilege or non-disclosure right claims, to copy or image, seal and remove them, or to remove the electronic storage device containing those documents for imaging off-site.
    3.  Where electronically stored documents have been imaged:
        1.  The imaged copy will remain in the custody of DFU, and will not be released to Inland Revenue investigators until after this process is complete; and
        2.  The owner can provide a list of keywords to DFU to be used to identify documents to which section 20 or sections 20B to 20G apply.
    4.  In relation to hard copy documents that are potentially subject to legal privilege or non-disclosure right claims, to seal and remove them.
    5.  Work with the owner of the documents to agree a process for:
        1.  Storage of the documents;
        2.  Making particularised claims of legal privilege or non-disclosure within a reasonable timeframe; and
        3.  Reviewing and resolving disputed privilege and non-disclosure right claims within a reasonable timeframe.
    
    *   Where particularised claims are not made, and disputed claims are not resolved, within the agreed timeframe, the Commissioner will then continue to use the documents for investigative purposes.

137.  While the Commissioner might agree to documents potentially subject to claims of legal privilege or the non-disclosure right remaining sealed for a reasonable period until the owner has the opportunity to review them, make particularised claims, and resolve any disputed claims, where the owner has neglected or chosen not to do so, the Commissioner can take any steps necessary to enable the investigation to continue.
138.  In addition, section 180(2)(b) of the SSA specifically authorises the Commissioner to continue with the investigation when proceedings have been commenced in relation to the exercise of section 16 or the use of any evidential material obtained from the search. Taxpayers can apply to the High Court under section 180(3) of the SSA for interim orders overriding section 180(2).
139.  If the claim of legal privilege or the non-disclosure right cannot be resolved between the Commissioner and the person making the claim, either party can apply to a District Court Judge for orders under section 20(5) as to whether the claim for legal privilege is valid, or under section 20G as to whether the document is a tax advice document (or for related orders regarding tax contextual information).

**After the search**

_Access to documents_

140.  Where the Commissioner removes a document under section 16B, the owner is entitled under section 16B(4) to inspect and obtain a copy of the document that is removed:
    1.  At the time of removal; or
    2.  At reasonable times subsequent to the removal.
141.  Where the Commissioner removes and retains a document under section 16C, the owner is entitled under section 16C(5) to obtain a copy of the document either at the time of removal or at reasonable times thereafter.

_Return of documents_

142.  The Commissioner will return original documents as soon as practicable, as required by section 16B(2). This includes electronic storage media removed for imaging.
143.  Where documents have been removed for retention and inspection under section 16C, the originals will not be returned until the Commissioner has completed a full and complete inspection of those documents. A full and complete inspection includes the use of the documents in court proceedings, therefore the Commissioner may not be able to provide a timeframe by which documents are likely to be returned.
144.  However, under section 16C(7), the Commissioner can make certified copies of documents retained under section 16C, and those copies are admissible as evidence in court as if they were the original documents. Therefore, unless there are good reasons to retain the originals, the Commissioner will generally copy and return original documents retained under section 16C.
145.  Examples of good reasons to retain the original documents are:
    1.  Where the Commissioner intends to undertake forensic examination of the documents.
    2.  Where the documents are unable to be quickly organised and analysed (this could be due to the poor state of the documents or poor recordkeeping by the owner).
    3.  Where a certified copy will not provide the best evidence in court proceedings (for example, marks on the original document may be illegible on the copy).

**Offences**

146.  The importance of the Commissioner being able to obtain information under sections 16, 16B and 16C means that it is an offence to obstruct the Commissioner or an authorised officer in carrying out those powers, and it is an offence to provide the Commissioner with false information in relation to the exercise of section 16.
147.  There are a number of specific offences in the TAA and the SSA relating to search powers, as well as offences under the Crimes Act 1961. The TAA and SSA offences are:
    1.  Obstruction under section 143H.
    2.  Not providing information when required to do so by a tax law, under section 143(1)(b).
    3.  Knowingly not providing information under section 143A(1)(b).
    4.  Knowingly not providing information with intent to evade tax or obtain a refund or payment of tax, under section 143B(1)(b) and any of (f), (g) or (h).
    5.  Knowingly providing false, incomplete or misleading information under section 143A(1)(c).
    6.  Knowingly providing false, incomplete or misleading information intending to evade tax or obtain a refund or payment of tax, under section 143B(1)(c) and any of (f), (g) or (h).
    7.  Aiding, abetting, inciting or conspiring with another person to commit an offence against the TAA, under section 148.
    8.  Failing to comply with a direction under section 117(1) of the SSA when a search warrant is pending, being an offence under section 176 of the SSA.
    9.  Failing to stop a vehicle as soon as practicable when required to do so, under section 177 of the SSA.
    10.  Failing to carry out obligations in relation to computer systems when required to do so by section 130(1) of the SSA, which is an offence under section 178 of the SSA.
    11.  Disclosing information acquired through the exercise of a search power, under section 179 of the SSA.
    12.  Knowingly failing to comply with section 87(1)(a)before accessing restricted information, under section 143E(1)(a).
    13.  Knowingly communicating any restricted information in contravention of section 87(1)(b) after having certified in the manner prescribed by section 87(3), under section 143E(1)(b).
148.  If convicted of an offence under section 143H, a taxpayer will be liable for a fine of up to $25,000 for the first offence, and up to $50,000 for each subsequent offence.
149.  Where the failure to provide information (for example, answers to proper questions, or reasonable facilities and assistance) is done knowingly and with the intention to commit evasion or a similar offence, a taxpayer could be liable for a fine of up to $50,000, or imprisonment for up to five years, or both.
150.  Failing to assist with a search when required to do so under section 130(1) of the SSA carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment of three months.
151.  And under section 179 of the SSA, disclosing information acquired through the exercise of a search power carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment of six months (and a fine for body corporates of up to $100,000).
152.  Decisions to prosecute will be made in accordance with the Solicitor-General's Prosecution Guidelines and Inland Revenue's Prosecution Framework.

**Summary**

153.  The powers in sections 16, 16B and 16C of the Tax Administration Act are essential to the compliance functions and duties of the Commissioner. They will be exercised along with the powers in the Search and Surveillance Act, preserving legal privilege and non-disclosure rights, and in compliance with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act where applicable.

This Operational Statement is signed on 26 July 2013.

### Appendix 1: Summary of the application of the SSA to the TAA

Section 89 of the SSA sets out the extent and manner in which the general provisions in Part 4 of the SSA apply to:

1.  powers conferred by other Parts of the SSA and
2.  other enactments.

In relation to other enactments, this is done by enlisting the assistance of a schedule to the SSA:  section 89(2) states that Part 4 applies in respect of powers conferred by the enactments listed in column 2 of the Schedule to the SSA.

The use of a schedule in this way makes it clear that the only provisions which apply to the TAA are those listed in the Schedule. The Schedule itself consists of four columns, listing as follows:

1.  Column 1 states the Act;
2.  Column 2 specifies a section of that Act (the specific search powers);
3.  Column 3 contains a brief description of the power in that section and
4.  Column 4 sets out which provisions in Part 4 of the SSA apply.

The TAA is listed in column 1 of the Schedule, and the Commissioner's search power (section 16) and power to remove and retain documents under warrant (section 16C(2)) are listed in column 2.

Column 4 states that only subparts 1, 3, 4, 7, 9 and 10 (except sections 102, 103(3)(b)(ii), 103(4)(g), 103(7), 115(1)(b), 118, 119 and 130(4)) of Part 4 apply to these powers (subpart 2 contains the warrant application rules).

Section 17 notices
==================

OS 13/02 outlines the procedures IR follows when issuing section notices, relating to requisitions for information.

This statement also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol.25, No.8 (September 2013).

All legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) unless otherwise stated.

#### Introduction

1.  This Operational Statement ("OS") outlines the procedures Inland Revenue will follow when issuing notices, including third party requests, under section 17. The section, which relates to requisitions for information, is one of Inland Revenue's information-gathering powers. Other information-gathering powers (such as section 16) can be and are used by the Commissioner in conjunction with section 17 but they are not discussed in this OS.
2.  The OS has been updated to incorporate amendments to the legislation concerning these powers, to incorporate principles, particularly in respect of non-disclosure rights, established in cases that have been decided since Standard Practice Statement _05/08 Section 17 Notices_ was published in 2005. It also outlines the impact of the recently enacted Search and Surveillance Act 2012 (the SSA) on the Commissioner's power to obtain information under production orders.

#### Application

3.  The OS applies from 14 August 2013 and replaces Standard Practice Statement _05/08 Section 17 Notices_, published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 17, No 6 (August 2005).

#### Background

4.  Before the Commissioner can verify or make an assessment of a person's tax liability, information (including non-documentary information which is within a person's knowledge) is needed. The legislation provides the Commissioner with the necessary powers, including section 17, to collect information. Section 17 empowers the Commissioner to require any person to furnish in writing any information and to produce for inspection any documents that are considered "necessary or relevant" to exercise the Commissioner's statutory functions.
5.  Inland Revenue staff will usually request information and documents without expressly relying on section 17. This practice fosters a spirit of reasonableness and mutual cooperation.
6.  If, however, information is not provided voluntarily or in a timely manner the Commissioner is able to use section 17 to demand the information by issuing a notice under the section. In some cases the information gathering process may be commenced by issuing a section 17 notice. For example, this may occur where there have been prior instances of non-cooperation from the taxpayer and/or their advisers. Non-compliance with the section 17 notice will result in the Commissioner invoking the statutory remedies.
7.  Any request for information with express reference to section 17 will generally contain reference to taxpayers' right to make a claim for non-disclosure to ensure that the recipient of the notice is aware of this statutory right belonging to the taxpayer. However in some cases the nature of a request may not warrant a reference to the right to claim non-disclosure, such as where the request is for information that relates purely to information which is not contained in tax advice documents.
8.  SPS _05/07 Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents_ provides information on what constitutes a tax advice document, and sets out the process for making a claim of non-disclosure.

#### Legislation

#### The Search and Surveillance Act 2012

10.  The SSA came into effect on 1 October 2012, although for Inland Revenue it will take effect from 1 April 2014, or an earlier of the date if given effect by an Order in Council. The relevant sections are sections 3 and 123, and Schedule to the SSA.
11.  The SSA contains a detailed list of basic powers that a person exercising search powers can make use of. Refer to Operational Statement 13/01 _The Commissioner of Inland Revenue';s search powers_, published in relation to section 16 concerning these powers.

### Analysis of key changes

_The new definition of 'document'_

12.  The definition of 'book and document' and 'book or document' in section 3(1) was repealed and replaced with 'document' effective from 29 August 2011.The words 'book and document' throughout the TAA were replaced with the new term 'document'. The reason for the update is to remove references to redundant technology and to future proof the definition as some of the old terminology refers to out of date technology such as computer reels and perforated reels.

13.  The definition of 'document' is much wider than the repealed definition of 'book and document' as it clearly includes all forms of information storage.It does not, however, extend the old definition.Rather it updates it by removing references to redundant technology. The definition of 'document' should not, therefore, affect departmental practice as the repealed definition of 'book and document' included any records in electronic form. This view was confirmed by the High Court in _Avowal Administrative Attorneys Ltd v District Court at North Shore_ (2009) 24 NZTC 23,252 where Venning J rejected the appellant's argument that a computer hard drive did not come within the old definition of 'book and document'. The Court of Appeal \[2010\] 3 NZLR 661 confirmed the position taken by Venning J that the definition of 'book and document' included 'any other type of record' which was wide enough to encompass computer hard drives.

_Non-disclosure right_

14.  The Commissioner's wide information gathering powers under section 17 are subject to legal professional privilege (section 20) and to non-disclosure right for a tax advice document (sections 20B to 20G). The High Court in _Blakeley v C of IR_ (2008) 23 NZTC 21,865 considered the scope of protection against disclosure of a tax advice document provided by sections 20B to 20G.The case concerned a section 17 notice issued to the appellant requiring him to provide a list of names and IRD numbers of clients to whom he had provided tax advice in respect of certain transactions.The appellant declined to provide the information on the basis that it would involve the disclosure of a tax advice document which was protected by section 20B. The High Court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the finding of the District Court that the right to non-disclosure of a tax advice document in respect of the information required is not available to the appellant. The following observations made by the Court indicate the scope of non-disclosure right:
    *   The protection afforded by section 20B is more confined than legal professional privilege.It is not a new substantive right of equivalent utility to legal professional privilege. It was a creature of statute and protected defined parts of a limited category of written communications.
    *   The plain words of the legislation gave no protection to the information from disclosure sought by the Commissioner.
    *   Tax contextual information contained in the opinions would not be protected from disclosure even if the tax advice itself was.
    *   Waiver did not arise under sections 20B to 20G. The protection against disclosure provided by the legislation was not susceptible to waiver.The right to disclosure must be claimed by following the detailed procedure set out in section 20D.If the procedure set out in the legislation was not followed, there would be no right to non-disclosure.

_Litigation on an even basis_

15.  In a number of cases it has been argued that section 17 is subject to the principle that litigation should be conducted on an even basis and therefore the Commissioner should not be allowed to seek information once the proceedings have been issued.In _Vinelight Nominees Ltd v C of IR_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,298 the Commissioner viewed the taxpayer's returns as being fraudulent and misleading and sought to reissue assessments.After the taxpayer filed proceedings to challenge the Commissioner's decision, the Commissioner issued section 17 notices to seek information relating a statement made in the taxpayer's notice of response. The High Court declined to make a declaration, as sought by the taxpayer, that the Commissioner could not use section 17 to obtain information once the court proceedings had commenced.The Court considered that the Commissioner's dominant motivation was not to gain advantage as a litigant, but rather to assist the making of the revised assessments.The Court however concluded that the principle of litigation on an even basis limits the scope of section 17 and that a section 17 notice could not be issued for the sole purpose of extracting information to use in the legal proceedings; the principle to be applied on a case by case basis.
16.  Chesterfield Preschool Ltd v C of IR (No 2) (2005) 22 NZTC 19,500 was another High Court case concerning the scope of section 17.Fogarty J's views on section 17 differed from those of Simon France J in _Vinelight_.Fogarty J considered that the principle of litigation on an even basis did not apply in the context of disputes concerning the recovery of unpaid tax.He said that section 17 was intended by Parliament to be an effective instrument for obtaining information, particularly documents, and that was its purpose.There was no basis of suspending the Commissioner's powers under section 17 even though some aspects of the proceedings have become subject to the High Court rules.
17.  The High Court in _Next Generation Investments Ltd (in liq) v C of IR_ (2006) 22 NZTC 19,775 noted the conflicting views in _Vinelight_ and _Chesterfield_ as to the scope of section 17 but did not endorse either of them. Priestley J preferred the balanced use of section 17 adopted by France J in _Vineligh_t.He said that the Commissioner's powers could not be exercised in an unfettered way. As a statutory power, it would be subject to an application for a judicial review should it be used _ultra vires_ or in some other improper manner.
18.  In _Foxley v C of IR_ (2008) 23 NZTC 21,813 the Court said that the _Vinelight, Chesterfield_ and _Next Generation_ cases established that the Commissioner may use section 17 to request information, at least until challenge proceedings are on foot, and potentially beyond, provided that the powers are exercised for a proper purpose.
19.  The Commissioner's search and seizure powers were challenged in _Tauber v C of IR_ (2011) 25 NZTC 20,071 by way of a judicial review.The applicants claimed that the conduct of the search by the Commissioner was a breach of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (NZBORA).Venning J referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in _Commerce Commission v Air New Zealand_ \[2011\] 2 NZLR 194 which involved the consideration of a non-disclosure order and the impact of section 27(3) of the NZBORA on the information gathering powers of the Commerce Commission.In that case the Court of Appeal approved the approach of Simon France J in _Vinelight_ where hesaid that the principle of litigation on an even basis limits the scope of section 17, and it could not be used for the sole purpose of extracting information to use in the legal proceedings.
20.  These cases confirm that Inland Revenue's information gathering powers may be exercised up until the time challenge proceedings are commenced.They may, on occasion, be exercised after the legal proceedings are commenced provided they are used for a proper purpose, not to gain an otherwise unachievable advantage, and not used for the purpose of extracting information for use in the proceedings.

_Use of section 17 notice post liquidation/bankruptcy_

21.  The Commissioner may use her section 17 powers to obtain documents/information from a liquidator without first obtaining an order under section 256(1)(a) of the Companies Act 1990 for the purpose of giving effect to her statutory duties such as to ascertain a correct tax liability, for prosecution and other related matters: _Next Generation Investment Ltd (in liq) &Ors v C of IR_ (2006) 22 NZTC 19,775.

_Access to audit work papers_

22.  Since the publication of SPS 05/08 the Commissioner's policy on access to audit working papers has been updated to provide guidelines effective from 29 April 2008. The Protocol on _Access to Audit Working Papers_ (Protocol) was signed between the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA) and Inland Revenue on 29 April 2008.Requests to access to audit working papers will be made on the basis of the policy outlined in the Protocol. A copy of the document can be found on the [Inland Revenue website](/general-articles/protocol-between-the-new-zealand-institute-of-chartered-accountants-and-inland-revenue-for-access-to)
    .
23.  Documents that are prepared solely for audit purposes in relation to a client's accounting or tax positions and exposures constitute 'audit working papers'.They are the property of the auditor and not of the client.Working papers in relation to other work undertaken by an external auditor are referred to as 'other working papers'.They may include tax work papers, such as papers compiled in order to complete the tax return or to provide tax advice.Other working papers form part of the taxpayer's records, whether they are held by the auditor, the taxpayer or a third party.

_Relationship between SSA production orders and TAA production orders_

24.  Section 71 of the SSA contains a production order power that is similar to the Commissioner's power under section 17A of the TAA.
25.  The SSA production order can only be used where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the documents sought constitute evidential material in respect of an offence,and that the documents are or will be in the possession or control of the person to whom the production order is used.Failure to comply with a production order under section 71 of the SSA carries with it a one year sentence of imprisonment.
26.  However, because sections 16 and 17 provide very broad powers of obtaining information, Inland Revenue will generally use section 17 and not rely on a production order under the SSA, unless there are circumstances that may warrant the use of an SSA production order instead of one under the TAA. A production order power under the SSA will only be used with the approval of the Group Tax Counsel or Group Manager, Investigation and Advice.

#### Operational practice

**Section 17 Notices**

27.  Section 17 gives the Commissioner the power to require persons to produce for inspection documents which the Commissioner considers necessary or relevant for any purpose relating to the administration or enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts. It is most often used in the context of the investigation of a taxpayer's correct tax position, but can also be used, for example, in liquidation/insolvency situations to obtain information/documents, provided it is not used for improper purposes. However a section 17 power cannot be invoked for questionable or improper purpose, such as to gain advantage over other creditors or for debt recovery.
28.  We would generally not use the section 17 powers for the sole purpose of requiring taxpayers to provide outstanding returns as the Commissioner can, under section 17A(3), apply for a court order requiring the taxpayer to provide the tax return if a taxpayer does not provide a tax return on time.
29.  The new definition of "document", although broad, does not extend the old definition of "book or document" but instead updates it by removing references to redundant technology. The new definition does not, therefore, affect Inland Revenue’s current practice as it is considered that the repealed definition included any records in electronic form.
30.  Case law confirms that the Commissioner may exercise the information gathering powers pursuant to section 17 up until the time challenge proceedings are commenced. They may, on occasion, be exercised after the legal proceedings are commenced provided they are used for a proper purpose, not to gain an otherwise unachievable advantage, and not used for the purpose of extracting information for use in the proceedings.
31.  Section 17 authorises Inland Revenue to require written answers to questions relating to the documents requisitioned under the section, and also written answers relating to other information. Such answers, if self-incriminatory, are nevertheless admissible against the person who made them: _Singh v C of IR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,471; R v Sew, Hoy_, CA 315/91 & CA 316/91, 6 December 1991. However section 17 does not authorise questions unrelated to the documents, such as questions that directly seek to compel confession to elements of offending that may have been committed by, e.g. using the documents
32.  Where information is to be demanded under section 17, a notice will be issued in writing. Prior to issuing a section 17 notice, Inland Revenue will consider a number of factors that are outlined below:  
      
    _The reason for requiring the information_
33.  The Commissioner will only require disclosure of information considered necessary or relevant and that is reasonably required in the circumstances of the case.  
      
    _The impact of the demand on the suppliers of information_
34.  The Commissioner will be reasonable in relation to the quantity of information sought and the timeframe for providing that information. Reasonable time will be allowed where there is genuine difficulty in obtaining and/or providing the information requested.  
      
    _Reasons an informal request is not appropriate_
35.  Generally a section 17 notice will only be issued following a failure to provide information previously requested or where specific issues have been identified and attempts to resolve these issues have failed. However, there will be occasions where a section 17 notice may be issued without a prior informal request. For instance where:
    
    *   there have been prior instances of non-cooperation from the taxpayer. A refusal or failure to comply with an informal request or more formal request (that is one mentioning section 17) may be regarded as non-co-operation; or
    *   the Commissioner considers that a delay, or a less informal approach may unreasonably increase the risk of non-compliance; or
    *   the taxpayer’s adviser has been uncooperative in the past (including in respect of matters unrelated to the taxpayer) may be a relevant factor in deciding whether a section notice should be issued without a prior informal request.
    
      
    _Whether information is available publicly_
36.  Inland Revenue will generally not use section 17 where information held by public bodies such as Land Information New Zealand, the Companies Office and Quotable Value New Zealand is available publicly. Public availability of information does not, however, prevent Inland Revenue from requiring information to be provided under section 17.  
      
    _Whether the disclosure of tax contextual information is required_
37.  Where a section 17 notice contains a reference to the non-disclosure right for tax advice documents, the notice will also refer to when the tax contextual information (as defined in section 20F(3)) is required to be disclosed. If the Commissioner does require such a disclosure, that requirement will generally be the subject of a subsequent notice. However, in rare cases the notice will contain a requirement to disclose the tax contextual information as part of the disclosure requirement for the section 17 notice. For further information on the operation of the right to claim non-disclosure and the definition of key terms refer to the SPS _05/07 Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents_ and to the discussion below.
38.  Where the disclosure of the tax contextual information is required as part of the disclosure requirements in the section 17 notice, the tax contextual information must be provided on the form _Tax contextual information disclosure (IR 520)_ which contains a statutory declaration.  
      
    _The effect on the dispute resolution process_
39.  The dispute resolution process relies on full and prompt disclosure by both the Commissioner and the disputant. Inland Revenue will use a section 17 notice where previous requests for information have not been complied with. The use of a section 17 notice prior to commencement of the dispute resolution process may mean that the number of matters entering the process will be reduced.
40.  The disputes resolution process may be truncated and an amended assessment issued where a taxpayer has failed to comply with a section 17 notice during the dispute process: section 89N(1)(c)(vi).  
      
    _Inland Revenue’s intention to ensure compliance with the notice_
41.  Generally, Inland Revenue will use a section 17 notice only where it is prepared to invoke statutory remedies in the event of non-compliance.  
      
    _The use of section 16 powers_
42.  _In some cases, rather than demanding information under section 17 Inland Revenue will access the documents under section 16, which gives the Commissioner the power to enter all places (in the case of a private dwelling, either the consent of an occupier or a warrant is required) for the purposes of inspecting documents. For further information on the Commissioner’s policies in respect of section 16 please refer to OS 13/01.  
      
    Multiple sources_
43.  Nothing in section 17 precludes Inland Revenue from seeking information from multiple sources and from sources other than the affected taxpayer, whether before or after seeking the information directly from the relevant taxpayer.  
      
    _Multiple notices_
44.  Separate section 17 notices may be issued for different information and documents. If the Commissioner requires the information to be delivered to Inland Revenue, the notice will state that the information is to be delivered, or the documents to be produced, to a particular office of the Inland Revenue.  
      
    _Request for significant amount of documentation_
45.  Where a significant amount of documentation is required, the person providing the information will be permitted to send documents to the nearest Inland Revenue office. That office will arrange for the documents to be forwarded to the office conducting the investigation. Where the delivery cost would be reduced by $20 or more by sending documents to the nearest Inland Revenue office then it is considered that the amount of documentation is significant. In this circumstance Inland Revenue would generally accept the request to send the documents to the nearest office.  
      
    _Delegation_
46.  The decision whether or not to issue a section 17 notice has been delegated to various responsible officers. A decision to issue a section 17 notice will generally be peer reviewed by the delegated officer’s team leader. The exercise of the discretion to require disclosure of the tax contextual information is limited to officers at appropriately high level of delegated authority and any decision to require tax contextual information is signed off by Manager, Investigations or by Team Leader, Legal and Technical Services.  
      
    _Legal professional privilege_
47.  A taxpayer is entitled, and should have sufficient time, to seek legal advice in respect of whether any information or documents are subject to legal professional privilege. Section 20 covers the solicitor-client privilege. It provides that information is privileged from disclosure if it is a confidential communication passing between a legal practitioner and another legal practitioner (acting in their professional capacities) or a legal practitioner and a client, and it is brought into existence for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice or assistance. There are, however, exceptions to the privilege. Privilege does not apply when the communication was brought into existence for the purpose of committing some illegal or wrongful act. Also financial information and investment records kept in connection with solicitors’ trust accounts are not privileged.
48.  The privilege recognised by section 20 is not a complete code as it does not cover litigation privilege and other communications protected from disclosure at common law. Inland Revenue considers that the Commissioner’s powers under section 17 are subject to legal professional privilege contained in section 20 and litigation privilege at common law. In practice, however, Inland Revenue regards the section 20 privilege as extending to litigation privilege where New Zealand lawyers (as defined by the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006) are involved. For this purpose, litigation privilege is regarded as covering documents created for the dominant purpose of advising or assisting on reasonably apprehended litigation.  
      
    _Right to claim non-disclosure for tax advice documents_
49.  The Commissioner’s information gathering powers (including section 17) are subject to the statutory right to claim non-disclosure for tax advice documents. The right to claim non-disclosure relates to tax advice documents that are required to be disclosed under a section 17 notice. The right to claim non-disclosure belongs to the taxpayer. The statutory provisions contain time periods in which the taxpayer (or their authorised advisor) is required to make the necessary claim for non-disclosure. The taxpayer (or their authorised tax advisor) will be given at least 28 days to claim the non-disclosure right for those documents eligible to be tax advice documents, and required to be disclosed under the section 17 notice. This time period will be specified in the notice. The taxpayer or their authorised advisor can make the claim for non-disclosure by completing the form _Tax advice document claim (IR 519)_.
50.  The Commissioner will review the documents and information received in terms of the section 17 notice, and the information provided on the form IR 519. It will then be decided whether disclosure of the tax contextual information from the documents eligible to be tax advice documents is required. If the tax contextual information is required, a subsequent section 17 notice will be issued for the tax contextual information allowing at least another 28 days to provide the information.
51.  The tax contextual information must be provided in the prescribed form, Tax contextual information disclosure (IR 520). The form IR 520 contains a statutory declaration which needs to be completed by a tax advisor. For further information on tax contextual information and the necessary disclosure requirements, refer to the SPS 05/07 Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents or consult your tax advisor.
52.  In rare cases the Commissioner may require both the claim for the non-disclosure right and the disclosure of the tax contextual information from those documents that may be eligible to be tax advice documents in the one section 17 notice. In such cases, a taxpayer (and/or their authorised tax advisor) will be given at least 28 days to comply with all the disclosure requirements of the section 17 notice.
53.  The discretion to require disclosure of the tax contextual information from documents eligible to be tax advice documents will be exercised sparingly in order to minimise compliance costs, and so as not to undermine the spirit of the non-disclosure right rules. Accordingly, an exercise of this discretion will be limited to officers of Inland Revenue at an appropriately high level of delegated authority.
54.  There is no requirement for a person to disclose tax advice documents under a discovery obligation in challenge proceedings. The disclosure of tax contextual information may still be required.  
      
    _Advice and other work papers prepared by accountants_
55.  SPS _05/07 Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents_ outlines the Commissioner’s policy on Access to Advice and other Workpapers Prepared by Accountants in respect of section 17 notices with effect from 22 June 2005.  
      
    _Access to audit work papers_
56.  Requests for access to audit working papers will arise only in the course of enquiries conducted by investigators or in other special cases, although a request for audit working papers will not be a routine part of Inland Revenue’s investigations. In the first instance the information will be requested from the taxpayer, and requests to a taxpayer’s auditor for access will only be made in exceptional circumstances.
57.  This approach does not imply that audit working papers enjoy any privilege from disclosure unless they are tax advice documents to which section 20B to 20G apply. A request by an Investigator for access to audit papers will be made only after obtaining the authorisation of the appropriate manager who will need to consider whether the information requested is “necessary or relevant” for the administration of the Tax Acts.
58.  Requests for audit working papers and other papers made pursuant to section 17 will be “formal requests”. They will include details such as when and where the records are to be made available.  
      
    _Correction of information_
59.  Where a taxpayer has complied with an information requisition then, in accordance with section 6 of the Privacy Act 1993 (Information Privacy Principle No. 3), the taxpayer will be allowed to seek access to and correction of that information where Inland Revenue has incorrectly recorded the information.  
      
    _Changes to Section 17 Notices_
60.  In following the process concerning section 17 every attempt will be made to maintain contact with the taxpayer so as to provide an opportunity for concerns to be raised. Inland Revenue expects information holders to contact Inland Revenue where there is genuine difficulty in complying with the demand at the earliest possible time and not when the time for compliance has passed.
61.  Any change to the date for compliance must be agreed before the expiration of the original date. Beyond this, the offence for non-compliance has already occurred and an extension of time will not be given.
62.  Where modification of the notice is agreed it will be recorded in writing.
63.  Any change to the date for compliance set out in the section 17 notice should also consider the impact the change of date may have on the time periods allowed for claiming the right of non-disclosure.  
      
    _Requests to persons other than the taxpayer_
64.  Some holders of information, such as banks, are willing to provide information but require Inland Revenue to state its legal authority before they will release the information. Generally, where information is required from persons other than the taxpayer and cooperation is likely, Inland Revenue will initially seek the information by a letter, although the letter may follow a discussion and may contain reference to section 17.
65.  That letter is not a formal section 17 demand. However, generally where the letter is not complied with, a section 17 notice will be issued so that the third party recipient is informed of the consequences of their non-compliance before further action is taken.
66.  Any section 17 notice issued to a third party such as a bank should refer to the non-disclosure right. The recipient of the notice may then choose to contact the taxpayer to confirm whether the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor wish to claim the non-disclosure right or legal professional privilege over documents required to be disclosed under the section 17 notice issued to the third party.
67.  Where a formal section 17 notice is issued to a third party such as a bank it will be subject to an independent review by Legal and Technical Services before its issue.  
      
    _Controlled non-residents_
68.  Under section 17(1) Inland Revenue may require a New Zealand resident to provide information in circumstances where the resident’s non-resident employees or agents hold the information/documents for the resident. Section 17(1B) gives Inland Revenue the power to require a New Zealand resident to provide information held by a non-resident entity controlled directly or indirectly by the New Zealand resident. For example, if a husband and wife have 51% of the shares in a foreign company, Inland Revenue can issue a section 17 notice requiring them to furnish information held by the foreign company. Section 17(1C) sets out further rules for determining whether a non-resident is controlled. In particular it provides that foreign secrecy laws are to be ignored.
69.  If obtaining of the information would be a costly or difficult exercise then generally it would not be required where the tax at stake is immaterial, or when Inland Revenue has access to this information through other sources.  
      
    _Medical information_
70.  In rare instances Inland Revenue may seek access to an individual’s medical records. For example, there may be medical reasons given by the taxpayer for the failure to provide information or documents, or for not meeting tax obligations. In some case Inland Revenue may consider it necessary to verify the medical reasons for such failures. Such requests will only be made after careful consideration and will be made by an appropriate delegated officer.  
      
    _Requests for certain information from tax agents_
71.  Inland Revenue may seek certain information from tax agents under section 17 where it becomes aware of particular transactions or arrangements entered into by taxpayers in order to identify other taxpayers who may have entered into similar transactions or arrangements.
72.  In the first instance, Inland Revenue will attempt to identify those taxpayers without recourse to requesting information from tax agents. However Inland Revenue may ask tax agents likely to have involvement with the arrangements in question to provide a list of clients who may have entered into a particular (or similar) arrangement.
73.  These requests will only be made in limited circumstances and only where it is considered the transactions or arrangements are likely to involve tax avoidance or evasion, or other offences leading to prosecution for offences. Before making such requests to tax agents, investigators must first take all reasonable steps to obtain the necessary or relevant information from the taxpayer(s) or other third parties.
74.  Before making a request for information, staff will take into account a range of factors including:
    *   the impact of the request on taxpayers’ perception of the integrity of the tax system;
    *   the size of client bases involved, and the practicalities and the relative cost of compliance with the section 17 request;
    *   the level of perceived risk of taxpayers seeking to remove assets or leave the jurisdiction;
    *   the complexity of the arrangement, and the reasonableness of the expectation that the advisor will be able to identify the taxpayers in question;
    *   the level of revenue considered to be at risk;
    *   Inland Revenue’s ability to obtain the information from other sources.
75.  An Inland Revenue officer will then arrange to meet with the particular tax agent to advise that a formal section 17 notice is to be made, to provide a draft copy of the notice, explain the scope and matters to be covered in the notice and whether a formal notice is in fact the best way of achieving Inland Revenue’s objectives. Subject to any changes made to the draft notice the final notice will be sent to the tax agent. Any changes to the draft notice will be approved by an appropriate delegated officer.
76.  The tax agent will have the option to provide the information without a formal demand.
77.  Before any request for information is made, an independent review of the proposed request will be carried out by appropriately delegated officers to ensure the necessary criteria have been applied. This will include determining that the arrangement in question is clearly described and the parameters of the request are clear (for example, the scope of the request, the time period covered, the form of the response and the level of the detail required). Reference to this approval will be stipulated in the notice to the particular firm.
78.  The notice will offer where practicable Inland Revenue assistance to extract the information, and will also allow a reasonable time (to be specified) to provide the information.
79.  The tax agent can either contact the Manager, Investigations and Advice or the Group Manager, Investigations and Advice if he/she wishes to query the scope or authority of the investigator to request the information in the notice.  
      
    _Non-compliance with a section 17 notice_
80.  It is an offence not to comply with a section 17 notice. An offence has occurred where a person does not provide, or knowingly does not provide, information to the Commissioner when required to do so by a tax law: sections 143 and 143A. Furthermore it is an offence for a person knowingly not to provide information to the Commissioner or any other person when required to do so, with the intention of evading the assessment or payment of tax: section 143B. However, a person cannot be convicted of an offence for not providing information or knowingly not providing information (other than tax returns and tax forms) if the person proves that they did not have that information in their knowledge, possession or control: sections 143(2)(a) and (b) and 143A(2)(a) and (b). Control here is used in its wider sense and includes information held by others on one’s behalf.
81.  If the non-compliance with a section 17 notice relates to a requirement to disclose tax contextual information from tax advice documents, as required by section 20F, a number of offences may have occurred, including:  
      
    (a) Offences under sections 143 to 143B; or  
    (b) An offence under section 143H (obstruction); or  
    (c)An offence under the Crimes Act 1961 (false statements or declarations).
82.  Where non-compliance occurs, Inland Revenue will not reissue a section 17 notice in a different format. However, those receiving section 17 notices will have the ability to request a new due date for compliance with the notice so long as the request is made before the expiration of the original due date.
83.  In the event of non-compliance, a request for an explanation of why prosecution action should not be taken will generally be issued before further action is taken. A request for an explanation will state that as the section 17 notice has not been complied with an application for a court order under section 17A is being sought and/or prosecution action is being considered. A request for an explanation will not be issued in all cases, for example, where there have been delays in supplying information previously.
84.  A request for an explanation does not entitle the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor to claim (for the first time or to make a subsequent claim) the non-disclosure right for tax advice documents that were required to be disclosed under the original section 17 notice.
85.  Before an application for a court order under section 17A can be made there is a requirement for the Commissioner to use section 17, and the person to whom the notice has been issued must have failed to provide the information requested under that section 17 notice.
86.  If the Commissioner chooses to prosecute a person for not complying with a section 17 notice, then depending on the elements of the particular offence, there are different time limits within which the Commissioner must file charging documents to begin prosecution action:
    *   the time limit is 6 months for the offence of not knowingly providing information when required to do so;
    *   the time limit is 10 years for the absolute liability offence of not providing information when required to do so; and
    *   there is no time limit for the offence of knowingly not providing information when required and the offender does so with the intention to evade the assessment or payment of tax.
87.  Once the offence is committed prosecution action will be commenced within a reasonable time of the date of non-compliance. In general, prosecution would not be commenced where a person complies with the requirement to provide information after the stipulated time but prior to issue of a summons by the Court.  
      
    ,_Relevance of Search and Surveillance legislation to the information gathering powers_
88.  The rules in in the newly enacted SSA affect the TAA. For instance, the production order regime (Part 3, Subpart 2) and the power to seize items in plain view (section 123) in the SSA may be relevant to the Commissioner’s information gathering powers. However Inland Revenue will generally use section 17 and not rely on the production order under the SSA.

GST and the costs associated with mortgagee sales (WITHDRAWN)
=============================================================

Operational statement OS 15/01 (Aug 2015) outlines the GST and costs associated with mortgagee sales.

### Withdrawn

This statement has been withdrawn and replaced by [OS 17/01: GST and costs associated with mortgagee sales](/operational-statements/operational-statement-1701)
.

All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated.

### Introduction

1.  This Operational Statement sets out the Commissioner's position on GST input tax claims in relation to the costs of sale associated with mortgagee sales, namely:
    1.  Whether the mortgagee's costs of sale can be deducted prior to the calculation of GST due, and
    2.  Whether a mortgagee can claim input tax on a mortgagee sale for the costs associated with the mortgagee sale, and
    3.  Whether a mortgagee can claim input tax on the costs associated with the mortgagee sale where the sale is subject to the business to business financial services rules, and
    4.  Whether a mortgagor can claim input tax on a mortgagee sale for the costs of sale incurred by the mortgagee.

### Application

2.  This Operational Statement applies from 24 August 2015 and sets out the Commissioner's position in relation to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.  It replaces OS 005 _GST and the costs of sale associated with mortgagee sales_ (April 2004).

### Discussion

#### Whether the mortgagee's cost of sale can be deducted prior to the calculation of GST due

3.  The term "costs of sale" in this statement refers to expenses that are occasioned by the mortgagee sale.  Examples of such expenses are legal fees, valuation fees and real estate advertising and commission.  The term "costs of sale" does not include money that is owed under the mortgage such as the interest or principal of the mortgage.
4.  Section 5 deems a supply to take place in specific situations.  In particular, section 5(2) deals with a sale in satisfaction of debt situation.  It provides for there to be a supply by the defaulting person (the mortgagor) where the goods (the mortgaged property) are sold under a power exercisable by another person (the mortgagee) under the terms of the mortgage agreement.  As there is a supply under a mortgagee sale, GST is to be charged pursuant to section 8 or section 11.
5.  It should be noted that section 5(2)(a) and (b) provide for exceptions where a sale in satisfaction of debt would not be deemed a supply.
6.  Section 5(2) alone does not aid in determining whether or not GST is to be calculated on the sale price inclusive of the costs of sale.  It has to be read in conjunction with section 17. 
7.  Section 17 requires a person selling goods in a sale in satisfaction of a debt to perform certain duties.  
8.  Section 17(1)(a) states that the person selling the goods (whether or not GST registered) must furnish a return to the Commissioner in the prescribed form.  The prescribed form is the _Goods and services tax return for goods sold in satisfaction of debt_ (IR 373).  This is referred to as the "special return" in this statement. 
9.  The special return must be furnished on or before the date set out in section 17(1B).  Sales made in any month must be returned by the 28th of the following month except where the sale is made in either November or March, in which case they must be returned by the following 15th January and 7th May respectively.
10.  The person selling the goods must at the same time, pay to the Commissioner the amount of tax that was charged on the supply and furnish to the person whose goods were sold, details of the information in the special return pursuant to sections 17(1)(c).
11.  Section 17(2) deems the amount of tax charged on the supply to be tax payable and recoverable as a debt that is due to the Crown.  
      
    _Section 185 Property Law Act 2007 and section 17 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985_  
      
    
12.  Section 185(1)(a) of the Property Law Act 2007, by way of section 185(2), provides for the proceeds from the mortgagee sale to be applied to amounts reasonably paid or advanced by the mortgagee with a view to realisation of the security.  This is the equivalent provision to the now repealed section 104 of the Land Transfer Act 1952.   However, section 104 and its successor section 185 of the Property Law Act 2007 are not relevant to the question of who must pay the GST on mortgagee sales.  The Privy Council's judgment in _Edgewater Motel Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2004) 21 NZTC 18,664_ dealt with this issue.  Paragraph \[10\] of the Privy Council judgment was the response to Counsel for Edgewater's submission that GST was not an expense occasioned by the sale.  It reads:
    *   \[10\].  …There is no conflict between s 17 and s 104 of the 1952 Act because s 17 does not purport to interfere with the order of priorities laid down by s 104.  It does not say that the mortgagee must pay the GST out of the proceeds of sale or of any particular fund.  It simply says that he must pay the GST.  As s 17(2) says, it creates a debt.  The Crown has no concern with how the payment of this debt affects the distribution of the proceeds of sale.  In claiming payment of the GST, the Crown is not seeking to assert a priority in the distribution of the assets of the mortgagor, any more than an estate agent instructed by the mortgagee and claiming commission on the sale.  The claim lies directly against the mortgagee.
13.  Paragraph \[12\] of the Privy Council judgment then goes on to say:
    *   \[12\]           Once the mortgagee has paid the GST, the question of the priority of his claim for reimbursement will arise.  Their lordships consider that it is "plainly an expense occasioned by the sale" within the meaning of para (a).  It is an obligation imposed upon the mortgagee by virtue of his having sold the property.  He is therefore entitled to deduct it from the proceeds before payment of his own debt and is accountable to subsequent encumbrancers only for the balance.
14.  The Privy Council is saying that the GST liability lies with the mortgagee, and is not dependent on any priority to the sale proceeds.  Section 185 of the Property Law Act 2007 simply provides that the mortgagee is entitled to reimbursement of their costs from the proceeds of sale ahead of other claims on the proceeds including that of the mortgage itself.  
15.  There is no ability for the costs of sale related to a mortgagee sale to be deducted prior to the calculation of GST output tax due under section 17.

#### Whether a mortgagee can claim input tax in a mortgagee sale for the costs associated with the mortgagee sale

16.  A mortgagee is not able to claim input tax incurred on costs associated with the mortgagee sale.
17.   _Case Y2_ 23 NZTC (2007) 13,017 is directly on point and confirms the Commissioner's view. Judge Barber of the Taxation Review Authority found at paragraph \[72\]:
    *   The disputant is not entitled to input tax deductions with respect to its sale of the property as mortgagee.  The express language of s 17 of the GST Act provides that, in a s 17 Special Return, the disputant must pay the full amount of output tax, without any deduction for input tax.  There is nothing in the scheme and purpose of the Act which supports input tax deductions being available for the deemed supply. 
18.  This confirms the Commissioner's position.  One argument to the contrary is that the mortgagee acts as the mortgagor's agent in a mortgagee sale and therefore the mortgagee is entitled to claim input tax on the sold property.  However, it is Inland Revenue's view that the relationship between a mortgagee and a mortgagor is one of creditor and debtor.  The mortgagee acts on their own behalf when exercising a power of sale.   
19.  Usually, the mortgagee sale occurs through a power exercised by the mortgagee as agreed in the mortgage agreement because of the mortgagor's default in the mortgage payments.  Consequently, the mortgagee cannot purport to claim input tax on the costs of sale as agent for the mortgagor.
20.  For the mortgagee to be permitted to claim input tax for costs associated with the mortgagee sale, the costs would have to be incurred in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity undertaken by the mortgagee.  The mortgaged property would have to have been supplied in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity undertaken by the mortgagee.  Putting aside the fact that section 5(2) deems the mortgaged property to be supplied in the course or furtherance of the mortgagor's taxable activity, in some cases the mortgagee may argue an indirect connection with some other activity that the mortgagee is GST registered for.  This matter was also considered in _Case Y2._  It was felt that this indirect connection is incidental to a mortgagee's activity of providing financial services.  And in that case, the provision of financial services was an exempt supply (section 14) and not part of a taxable activity (section 6).  However, it should be noted that _Case Y2_ was not decided on this basis.  The Case was decided on the fact that the costs associated with the mortgagee sale were incurred in the course of a taxable supply deemed to be made by a mortgagor.

#### Whether a mortgagee making a mortgagee sale that is subject to the business-to-business financial services rules can claim input tax for the costs associated with that mortgagee sale

21.  Sections 11A(1)(q) and 11A(1)(r) allow financial service providers that are registered for GST to zero-rate supplies of financial services to their customers (or in the case of a group of companies, the group's customers) that are registered for GST if the level of taxable supplies made by the customers, in a given 12- month period, is equal to or exceeds 75% of their total taxable supplies for the period.  Section 20C and sections 20D to 20F support the financial services rules.
22.  Input tax deductions may be made to the extent goods and services are used for making those supplies under the business to business financial services rules.  However, the effect of section 5(2) is that the goods sold are deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the mortgagor.  There is no scope to suggest that the same goods are contemporaneously being supplied in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity being carried on by the mortgagee.
23.  There is an argument that the expenses are directly or indirectly related to a mortgagee's money lending activity.  However, the Commissioner believes that the nexus test between an expense and a person's supplies must generally be applied narrowly where the expense is directly related to and wholly consumed in a particular supply.  Only where this is not the case and the expenses are in the nature of overhead type expenses is it appropriate to apply the nexus test to an overall activity.  There is various New Zealand case law that supports the direct nexus approach including _C of IR v Databank Systems Ltd_ (1990) 12 NZTC 7,227 and _Wairakei Court Limited v CIR_ (1999) 19 NZTC 15,502. 
24.  Support for the overhead approach can be found in _CIR v Trustees in Mangaheia Trust and Trustees in the Te Mata Property_ (2009) 24 NZTC 23,711.  Although this case is not completely on point, it does deal with aspects of the breadth of a supply, and states that it is well understood that in terms of claiming for business expenditure, the reference to "making taxable supplies" is to be read broadly (paragraph \[31\]).  A simple example referred to in the case is the situation where input tax credits are claimed on supplies such as tea or coffee used by employees in a taxable activity.
25.  A supply can be acquired for the purpose of making taxable supplies, without necessarily being able to identify a specific supply to which the goods or services acquired relate.  However, the costs in relation to a mortgagee sale are in fact acquired specifically in relation to the supply which the Act deems to be undertaken by someone else (the mortgagor).  In that context input tax is not available to the mortgagee.  The input tax on these costs is not available by reference to some wider activity conducted by the mortgagee.  The Act's very specific treatment of the output tax consequences indicates the resulting input tax consequences.  The Privy Council's decision in _Edgewater_ seems to support this view.
26.  As such, no input tax deduction is available to a mortgagee for costs associated with a mortgagee sale made under the business to business financial services rules.   The costs are directly related to and wholly consumed in the deemed taxable supply by the mortgagor.

#### Whether the mortgagor can claim the input tax credits on the sale costs directly incurred by the mortgagee

27.  As the mortgagee is the recipient of the supply in these circumstances, the mortgagor cannot claim the input tax.  Section 3A(1)(a) defines input tax as tax charged under section 8(1) on a supply of goods or services acquired by the registered person.  The recipient of the supply of these services is the mortgagee and the purpose of the sale is for the mortgagee to receive the amount or part of the amount owing on the mortgage.  The mortgagor may ultimately receive the net proceeds of the sale, if there are any, but it cannot be said that the mortgagor is the recipient of the costs.

### Conclusions

28.  A mortgagee in a mortgagee sale cannot deduct the costs of sale before calculating the GST due under section 17 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.
29.  A mortgagee cannot claim input tax for the costs associated with a mortgagee sale.
30.  A mortgagee who is a registered person and makes a mortgagee sale that is subject to the business-to-business supply of financial services rules is unable to claim input tax for the costs associated with that mortgagee sale.
31.  A mortgagor cannot claim input tax for the costs, incurred by the mortgagee, associated with a mortgagee sale.

Operational Statement OS 16/01 Filing an IR 10 and Section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 INTRODUCTION This statement sets out the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s preference for the ways in which taxpayers may bring income to her attention when filing their annual return. Other than the return itself, other common ways are to complete the Financial statements summary (the IR 10) or to include a set of financial statements with their annual return. 1 The Commissioner’s preference is that this information is provided using the IR 10. This is because receiving the information via the IR 10 significantly reduces the administrative costs to Inland Revenue in processing the data for use by Inland Revenue, other government agencies (such as Statistics New Zealand) and the private sector. An exception to this are significant enterprises, 2 as the Commissioner requires these taxpayers to provide a package of information (including financial statements) for risk assessment. Inland Revenue has made several statements about income disclosure by taxpayers who complete an IR 10, rather than provide their financial statements when furnishing their annual tax return, and the impact of this on the time bar under s 108(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These statements are: • Tax Information Bulletin Vol 3, No 5 (March 1992): 11 • Tax Information Bulletin Vol 5, No 3 (September 1993): 1 • Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 13 (May 1995): 13 • Tax Information Bulletin Vol 10, No 3 (March 1998): 40, and • Agents Answers, Issue 133 (March 2011): 1. This statement amalgamates and replaces these items, and will apply to all decisions that may require the re-opening of a return of income made on or after 26 May 2016. This statement applies to the current IR 10 (for returns filed for the 2012-2013 and later income years) and the old IR 10 Accounts information form (for returns filed for the 2011-12 and earlier income years). This statement also appears in Tax Information Bulletin Vol.28, No.6 (July 2016). Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this statement refer to the Tax Administration Act 1994. 1 A Statement in support of a tax interpretation IR282 is another form that can accompany the return to help explain and support a taxpayer’s interpretation or tax position. This form can be found at www.ird.govt.nz 2 The Commissioner considers “significant enterprises” to be customer groups of companies with a gross turnover of greater than $80 million per annum where otherwise notified they are subject to the Basic Compliance Package process, or operating in specialist industries or subject to specialised tax laws. 1 BACKGROUND 1. In 2012, the IR 10 form was redesigned. The revised form allows taxpayers greater ability to disclose income, gains and receipts (which may or may not be necessarily classed or returned as taxable income), and also limits the potential for discrepancies between amounts recorded on the IR 10 and what is contained in a taxpayer’s financial statements. Some unnecessary items were also removed. 2. The changes mean the IR 10 form is now more aligned with financial statements. It also collects better data to help inform Government decisions, creates administrative savings for Inland Revenue and reduces compliance costs for some taxpayers. 3. The insertion of new data boxes provides greater opportunity for taxpayers to disclose income. The data boxes that were added to assist in greater disclosure are: • Box 26 Exceptional items • Box 28 Tax adjustments, and • Box 53 Untaxed realised gains/receipts. APPLICATION The Time Bar 4. Under s 108, if a taxpayer furnishes a tax return and an assessment has been made, the Commissioner is unable to amend that assessment to increase the tax payable if four years have passed from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provided the tax return. This is referred to as the time bar. Section 108 provides: 108 Time bar for amendment of income tax assessment (1) Except as specified in this section or in section 108B, if — (a) a taxpayer furnishes an income tax return and an assessment has been made; and (b) 4 years have passed from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provides the tax return,— the Commissioner may not amend the assessment so as to increase the amount assessed or decrease the amount of a net loss. ... (1B) Despite subsection (1), the Commissioner may not amend an assessment so as to increase an amount of research and development tax credit under section LH 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 if — (a) a taxpayer furnishes an income tax return for the 2008–09 or a later tax year; and (b) 2 years have passed from the latest date to provide a return of income for the relevant tax year and, for a member of an internal software development group to which section 68E applies, the latest date means the latest date for any member of the group; and (c) the taxpayer— (i) has not issued a notice of proposed adjustment to the Commissioner for an amount of a tax credit for research and development expenditure for the relevant tax year within the relevant response period; and (ii) has not asked for an assessment to be amended under section 113, having provided a detailed research and development statement under section 68D or 68E, as applicable, within the time limit referred to in paragraph (b). (2) If the Commissioner is of the opinion that a tax return provided by a taxpayer— (a) is fraudulent or wilfully misleading; or 2 (b) does not mention income which is of a particular nature or was derived from a particular source, and in respect of which a tax return is required to be provided,— the Commissioner may amend the assessment at any time so as to increase its amount. ... 5. If the Commissioner is of the opinion that the tax return provided by a taxpayer is fraudulent or wilfully misleading, or the return does not mention income of a particular nature or that was derived from a particular source, the Commissioner may amend the taxpayer’s assessment, despite the time bar: s 108(2). This is irrespective of the manner in which the income, receipt or gain has been returned to the Commissioner (ie by a financial statement or IR 10). 6. Before amending an assessment that has been time barred, the Commissioner must form the requisite opinion under either para (a) or para (b) of s 108(2). 7. In Vinelight Nominees Ltd & Anor v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 2) (2005) 22 NZTC 19,519 (HC), Lang J referred to the requisite opinion as “but one of the steps to be taken by the Commissioner before he issues an assessment” (at \[26\]). 8. Another step is that the formation of the opinion satisfies a threshold requirement of being made in good faith on the evidence available. Willy DJ explained this more fully in Case Q58 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,330, with reference to the earlier decision of the Court of Appeal in Maxwell v CIR \[1962\] NZLR 683. At 5,349, Willy DJ stated: It is therefore all the more important in my view that the caution expressed by Gresson P in Maxwell (above) that the Commissioner, and by extension this Court should act bona fide, and with a sense of responsibility in first forming an opinion. It is not until that opinion is formed that any onus rests on the objector to show an absence of fraud, or conduct which could be described as wilfully misleading. 9. Whether the tax return is fraudulent or wilfully misleading will depend on the individual circumstances of each case. Under s 149A(2), the onus of proof is on the taxpayer in all civil matters, except evasion. Therefore, if an opinion has been formed that a tax return is fraudulent or wilfully misleading, the taxpayer will need to disprove the Commissioner’s view. 10. If the return does not mention income of a particular nature, it does not need to be a fraudulent, deliberate or intentional act to permit the Commissioner to amend an assessment (see Babington v CIR \[1957\] NZLR 861 (SC) at 869). 11. Whether income of a particular nature, or income derived from a particular source, has been mentioned or omitted also depends on the circumstances of each case. In Cross v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,101 (CA), McMullin J stated at 6,110: It is neither possible nor practical to lay down a rule of general application by which questions of alleged omission of particular sources of income can be judged. Whether there has been an omission of 'all mention of income' must be considered in the circumstances of each case. 12. The court also held that it is not necessary for a taxpayer to return the income as assessable, as it is sufficient for the taxpayer to mention, or draw the Commissioner’s attention to, the income in the tax return. How far one needs to go then becomes a matter of fact and degree. See Cross v CIR; Case M102 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,634. 13. The Commissioner must be able to form her own views as to the correct treatment of the item based on the information provided by the taxpayer. What facts are 3 relevant and whether a taxpayer has done enough to draw an item to the Commissioner’s attention again depends on the circumstances of each case. Decision to reopen or not reopen an assessment 14. Once the Commissioner has formed the view that there has been an omission of all mention of income (which is of a particular nature or was derived from a particular source) or considers that the tax return is fraudulent or wilfully misleading, the Commissioner’s next step is to decide whether to reopen an assessment under s 108(2). 15. The Commissioner’s ability to use s 108(2) is a discretionary power, which does not have to be exercised in every case. In deciding whether to reopen a time-barred assessment, the Commissioner will need to consider ss 6 and 6A: 6 Responsibility on Ministers and officials to protect integrity of tax system (1) Every Minister and every officer of any government agency having responsibilities under this Act or any other Act in relation to the collection of taxes and other functions under the Inland Revenue Acts are at all times to use their best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system. (2) Without limiting its meaning, the integrity of the tax system includes— (a) taxpayer perceptions of that integrity; and (b) the rights of taxpayers to have their liability determined fairly, impartially, and according to law; and (c) the rights of taxpayers to have their individual affairs kept confidential and treated with no greater or lesser favour than the tax affairs of other taxpayers; and (d) the responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law; and (e) the responsibilities of those administering the law to maintain the confidentiality of the affairs of taxpayers; and (f) the responsibilities of those administering the law to do so fairly, impartially, and according to law. 6A Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1) The person appointed as chief executive of the department under the State Sector Act 1988 is designated the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. (2) The Commissioner is charged with the care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts and with such other functions as may be conferred on the Commissioner. (3) In collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner’s charge, and notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts, it is the duty of the Commissioner to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law having regard to— (a) the resources available to the Commissioner; and (b) the importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts; and (c) the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. 16. The Commissioner is required to maximise the collection of revenue. Therefore, there is the expectation that the Commissioner will generally amend an assessment. Under s 6A, the Commissioner may elect to forgo the immediate collection of revenue if it is considered that the course of action (not reopening the time-barred assessment) will “collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law”. In making such a decision, the Commissioner will have regard to: • the resources available to her (s 6A(3)(a)); • the importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts (s 6A(3)(b)); and • the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers (s 6A(3)(c)). 4 17. Furthermore, under s 6, the Commissioner is also required to consider whether the decision not to reopen a time-barred assessment will protect the integrity of the tax system. Reconstructed income, aggressive tax schemes or tax avoidance 18. The operational approach set out in this statement is intended to apply to cases where an IR 10 is filed instead of a financial statement and also generally where the limitations of the IR 10 form inhibits the disclosure of income. However, there are two circumstances - reconstructed income and aggressive tax schemes or tax avoidance - where this statement will not apply if an IR 10 is filed (instead of a financial statement). 19. Amounts that have been reconstructed by the Commissioner under s GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (also known as reconstructed income) are either practically or highly unlikely to have been recorded on the IR 10, financial statements or the taxpayer’s returns. Consequently, this statement could not apply to those situations. 20. It also follows that the Commissioner will not want to fetter her discretion to reopen (or not reopen) an assessment that is time barred by the application of this statement in cases where she is of the view that the taxpayer is involved in an aggressive tax scheme or tax avoidance. 3 21. In the circumstances above, the Commissioner still has the discretionary power under s 108 to determine whether the taxpayer has fraudulently or wilfully misled the Commissioner or whether there has been an omission of income. 22. Due to the importance of reopening the time bar to both the Commissioner and taxpayers, decisions to reopen a time-barred assessment in relation to tax avoidance cases that potentially involve reconstructed income will be subject to the Critical Task Assurance process. Critical Task Assurance is intended to ensure that key pieces of work are subject to an independent review by the Legal and Technical Services unit of Inland Revenue before being issued. IR 10 Application Section 108(2)(a) Fraudulent and wilfully misleading 23. If a tax return is fraudulent or wilfully misleading, irrespective of the manner in which the income, receipt or a gain is returned (or not returned), the Commissioner has the ability to reopen an assessment. Section 108(2)(b) Omission of income 24. Where a taxpayer has filed a fully completed IR 10, and the IR 10 is consistent with the financial statements, the taxpayer will be afforded the same protection of the time bar as would apply had the taxpayer provided their financial statements. This is in line with current Inland Revenue practice, as well as previously published statements by the Commissioner. 3 More information on the Commissioner’s view of the law on tax avoidance in New Zealand is outlined in IS 13/01 Tax Avoidance and the interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, available at http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/interpretations/2013/. 5 25. The operational approach of the Commissioner where an IR 10 has been filed (subject to \[18\]-\[22\] of this Operational Statement) is as follows: • If the IR 10 discloses the income, gain or receipt, the time bar will apply. • Where the IR 10, although fully completed and consistent with the financial statements, does not disclose the income, gain or receipt due to limitations in the IR 10 form, the following approach will be adopted: o If the unfiled financial statements disclose the income, gain or receipt, the return will not be amended even though the financial statements were not sent to Inland Revenue at the time the income tax return was filed. o If neither the IR 10 nor the unfiled financial statements disclose the income, gain or receipt, the return will be subject to a review by senior Service Delivery management to determine whether the time bar applies. 26. This means taxpayers will get the same benefit of the time bar without having to send in their financial statements to Inland Revenue. Any decision to reopen an assessment will be made once the taxpayer’s IR 10 and their financial statements (which will be requested as part of an investigation) are analysed. Consequently, taxpayers who file an IR 10 will only need to send their financial statements to Inland Revenue if they are requested to do so. 27. This approach can be reflected as follows: Examples of limitations of the IR 10 Taxpayer A files an IR 10 with nothing in box 53 for “Untaxed realised gains/receipts” or box 55 for “Disposals of fixed assets”. The Commissioner learns that the taxpayer was dealing in land or other fixed assets. Although the taxpayer disclosed the sales in their financial statements, which were not provided to the Commissioner, the taxpayer should have disclosed the sales in box 53 or box 55. Therefore, in this case, more information from the taxpayer will be required as to why the sales were not disclosed in the appropriate box before the Commissioner can form her view regarding the time bar. Taxpayer B files an Account Information IR 10 with his 2010 tax return. In 2016, the Commissioner finds the taxpayer has not returned a $250,000 gain on the sale of a share. This gain was disclosed in the financial statements, but was not returned on the basis that the gain was a capital receipt. The financial statements were not attached to the taxpayer’s 2010 tax return. A fully completed Account Information IR 10 accompanied the taxpayer’s 2010 tax return. The IR 10 did not disclose the $250,000 gain because it did not request any information about untaxed realised gains/receipts. Under this Operational Statement, the time bar will apply. 6 28. Any recommendation by an Inland Revenue officer to reopen the time bar due to an omission of income will also be subject to Critical Task Assurance and review by a senior manager. The review and consideration by a senior manager will take place as early as possible, and before a letter or notice is issued to the taxpayer advising that it is proposed to amend the return(s). 29. When deciding whether to amend an assessment, senior management will consider relevant factors, including the nature and amount of the income omitted and the circumstances leading to the omission of income. This Operational Statement is signed on 26 May 2016. Rob Wells LTS Manager – Technical Standards 7
OS 17/01: GST and costs associated with mortgagee sales Introduction All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Operational Statement sets out the Commissioner’s position on GST input tax claims in relation to the costs of sale associated with mortgagee sales, namely: (i) Whether the mortgagee’s costs of sale can be deducted prior to the calculation of GST due; and (ii) Whether a mortgagee can claim input tax on a mortgagee sale for the costs associated with the mortgagee sale; and Operational statement 15/01 has been reviewed with regard to a mortgagee who is subject to the business to business financial services rules. The revised statement now reflects at paragraphs 23 to 26 that the Commissioner’s believes that such mortgagees can claim an input tax deduction for costs associated with mortgagee sales. Transitional position We are aware that we are changing our position with regard to input tax claims for taxpayers under the business to business financial services rules from that set out in Operational Statement OS 15/01. This means that going forward a mortgagee who has made a formal election under section 20F to be subject to the business to business zero- rating rules can claim input tax deductions for costs associated with a mortgagee sale. A registered person who, while having made an election under section 20F, has not claimed input tax deductions for costs associated with a mortgagee sale, can: • Request that the Commissioner amend the relevant assessment under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Commissioner will consider such requests on a case by case basis applying the approach outlined in the Standard Practice Statement on section 113 (SPS 16/01 – Requests to amend assessments); or • Claim the input tax deduction in a subsequent period under the proviso to section 20(3) (provided the requirements of the proviso are met). The Commissioner’s general practice (as outlined in the SPS 16/01) is that where a registered person is able to make the required correction themselves in a later period, Inland Revenue will not expend resources considering whether to exercise the section 113 discretion to amend the original statement. However, a decision has been made that even though the taxpayer may be able to make the required amendment in a later return under section 20(3), in these cases this will not be a factor in determining whether to consider a request to amend the original assessment under section 113. This is a departure from the general practice outlined in SPS 16/01. (iii) Whether a mortgagee can claim input tax on the costs associated with the mortgagee sale where the sale is subject to the business to business financial services rules; and (iv) Whether a mortgagor can claim input tax on a mortgagee sale for the costs of sale incurred by the mortgagee. Application This Operational Statement applies from 6 September 2017 and sets out the Commissioner’s position in relation to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. It replaces OS 15/01 GST and the costs of sale associated with mortgagee sales (October 2015). Discussion Whether the mortgagee’s cost of sale can be deducted prior to the calculation of GST due 1. The term “costs of sale” in this statement refers to expenses that are occasioned by the mortgagee sale. Examples of such expenses are legal fees, valuation fees and real estate advertising and commission. The term “costs of sale” does not include money that is owed under the mortgage such as the interest or principal of the mortgage. 2. Section 5 deems a supply to take place in specific situations. In particular, section 5(2) deals with a sale in satisfaction of debt situation. It provides for there to be a supply by the defaulting person (the mortgagor) where the goods (the mortgaged property) are sold under a power exercisable by another person (the mortgagee) under the terms of the mortgage agreement. As there is a supply under a mortgagee sale, GST is to be charged pursuant to section 8 or section 11. 3. It should be noted that section 5(2)(a) and (b) provide for exceptions where a sale in satisfaction of debt would not be deemed a supply. 4. Section 5(2) alone does not aid in determining whether or not GST is to be calculated on the sale price inclusive of the costs of sale. It has to be read in conjunction with section 17. 5. Section 17 requires a person selling goods in a sale in satisfaction of a debt to perform certain duties. 6. Section 17(1)(a) states that the person selling the goods (whether or not GST registered) must furnish a return to the Commissioner in the prescribed form. The prescribed form is the Goods and services tax return for goods sold in satisfaction of debt (IR 373). This is referred to as the “special return” in this statement. 7. The special return must be furnished on or before the date set out in section 17(1B). Sales made in any month must be returned by the 28 th of the following month except where the sale is made in either November or March, in which case they must be returned by the following 15 th January and 7 th May respectively. 8. The person selling the goods must at the same time, pay to the Commissioner the amount of tax that was charged on the supply and furnish to the person whose goods were sold, details of the information in the special return pursuant to sections 17(1)(c). 9. Section 17(2) deems the amount of tax charged on the supply to be tax payable and recoverable as a debt that is due to the Crown. Section 185 Property Law Act 2007 and section 17 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 10. Section 185(1)(a) of the Property Law Act 2007, by way of section 185(2), provides for the proceeds from the mortgagee sale to be applied to amounts reasonably paid or advanced by the mortgagee with a view to realisation of the security. This is the equivalent provision to the now repealed section 104 of the Land Transfer Act 1952. However, section 104 and its successor section 185 of the Property Law Act 2007 are not relevant to the question of who must pay the GST on mortgagee sales. The Privy Council’s judgment in Edgewater Motel Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2004) 21 NZTC 18,664 dealt with this issue. Paragraph \[10\] of the Privy Council judgment was the response to Counsel for Edgewater’s submission that GST was not an expense occasioned by the sale. It reads: \[10\]. ...There is no conflict between s 17 and s 104 of the 1952 Act because s 17 does not purport to interfere with the order of priorities laid down by s 104. It does not say that the mortgagee must pay the GST out of the proceeds of sale or of any particular fund. It simply says that he must pay the GST. As s 17(2) says, it creates a debt. The Crown has no concern with how the payment of this debt affects the distribution of the proceeds of sale. In claiming payment of the GST, the Crown is not seeking to assert a priority in the distribution of the assets of the mortgagor, any more than an estate agent instructed by the mortgagee and claiming commission on the sale. The claim lies directly against the mortgagee. 11. Paragraph \[12\] of the Privy Council judgment then goes on to say: \[12\] Once the mortgagee has paid the GST, the question of the priority of his claim for reimbursement will arise. Their lordships consider that it is “plainly an expense occasioned by the sale” within the meaning of para (a). It is an obligation imposed upon the mortgagee by virtue of his having sold the property. He is therefore entitled to deduct it from the proceeds before payment of his own debt and is accountable to subsequent encumbrancers only for the balance. 12. The Privy Council is saying that the GST liability lies with the mortgagee, and is not dependent on any priority to the sale proceeds. Section 185 of the Property Law Act 2007 simply provides that the mortgagee is entitled to reimbursement of their costs from the proceeds of sale ahead of other claims on the proceeds including that of the mortgage itself. 13. There is no ability for the costs of sale related to a mortgagee sale to be deducted prior to the calculation of GST output tax due under section 17. Whether a mortgagee can claim input tax in a mortgagee sale for the costs associated with the mortgagee sale 14. A mortgagee is not able to claim input tax incurred on costs associated with the mortgagee sale. 15. Case Y2 23 NZTC (2007) 13,017 is directly on point and confirms the Commissioner’s view. Judge Barber of the Taxation Review Authority found at paragraph \[72\]: The disputant is not entitled to input tax deductions with respect to its sale of the property as mortgagee. The express language of s 17 of the GST Act provides that, in a s 17 Special Return, the disputant must pay the full amount of output tax, without any deduction for input tax. There is nothing in the scheme and purpose of the Act which supports input tax deductions being available for the deemed supply. 16. This confirms the Commissioner’s position. One argument to the contrary is that the mortgagee acts as the mortgagor’s agent in a mortgagee sale and therefore the mortgagee is entitled to claim input tax on the sold property. However, it is Inland Revenue’s view that the relationship between a mortgagee and a mortgagor is one of creditor and debtor. The mortgagee acts on their own behalf when exercising a power of sale. 17. Usually, the mortgagee sale occurs through a power exercised by the mortgagee as agreed in the mortgage agreement because of the mortgagor’s default in the mortgage payments. Consequently, the mortgagee cannot purport to claim input tax on the costs of sale as agent for the mortgagor. 18. For the mortgagee to be permitted to claim input tax for costs associated with the mortgagee sale, the costs would have to be incurred in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity undertaken by the mortgagee. The mortgaged property would have to have been supplied in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity undertaken by the mortgagee. Putting aside the fact that section 5(2) deems the mortgaged property to be supplied in the course or furtherance of the mortgagor’s taxable activity, in some cases the mortgagee may argue an indirect connection with some other activity that the mortgagee is GST registered for. This matter was also considered in Case Y2. It was felt that this indirect connection is incidental to a mortgagee’s activity of providing financial services. And in that case, the provision of financial services was an exempt supply (section 14) and not part of a taxable activity (section 6). 19. “Financial services” is defined in section 3(1)(ka) for the relevant purpose of this statement to mean “the payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal, dividend, or other amount whatever in respect of any debt security, equity security, participatory security, credit contract, contract of life insurance superannuation scheme, or futures contract.” 20. “Debt security”, defined in section 3(2) means any interest in or right to be paid money that is, or is to be, owing by any person; but does not include a cheque. Therefore, the collection of any amount of interest, principal, dividend, or other amount whatever in respect of any debt security is the provision of a financial service which is an exempt supply. 21. A mortgage is simply security for the repayment of a debt. It satisfies the definition of “debt security” as the mortgagee has the right to be paid money owed by the mortgagor under the mortgage. 22. Therefore, a mortgagee whose activity is as a lender would be considered to be carrying on an exempt activity. As such, the mortgagee would be unable to claim input tax from the mortgagee sale. This is subject to section 11A(1)(q) of the GST Act, which is discussed next. Whether a mortgagee making a mortgagee sale that is subject to the business-to- business financial services rules can claim input tax for the costs associated with that mortgagee sale 23. Sections 11A(1)(q) and 11A(1)(r) allow financial service providers that are registered for GST to zero-rate supplies of financial services to their customers (or in the case of a group of companies, the group’s customers) that are registered for GST if the level of taxable supplies made by the customers, in a given 12-month period, is equal to or exceeds 75% of their total taxable supplies for the period. Section 20C and sections 20D to 20F support the financial services rules. 24. Input tax deductions may be made to the extent goods and services are used for making those supplies under the business to business financial services rules. However, the effect of section 5(2) is that the goods sold are deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the mortgagor. 25. There is an argument that the expenses are not directly or indirectly related to a mortgagee’s money lending activity. The Commissioner believes that even though the sale of the property is deemed to be supplied by the mortgagor, the steps undertaken to protect the securities and sell the properties is part of the mortgagees money lending taxable activity. 26. As such, an input tax deduction is available to a mortgagee for costs associated with a mortgagee sale made under the business to business financial services rules. The costs are directly related to the money lending taxable by the mortgagee . Whether the mortgagor can claim the input tax credits on the sale costs directly incurred by the mortgagee 27. As the mortgagee is the recipient of the supply in these circumstances, the mortgagor cannot claim the input tax. Section 3A(1)(a) defines input tax as tax charged under section 8(1) on a supply of goods or services acquired by the registered person. The recipient of the supply of these services is the mortgagee and the purpose of the sale is for the mortgagee to receive the amount or part of the amount owing on the mortgage. The mortgagor may ultimately receive the net proceeds of the sale, if there are any, but it cannot be said that the mortgagor is the recipient of the costs. Conclusions 28. A mortgagee in a mortgagee sale cannot deduct the costs of sale before calculating the GST due under section 17 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 29. A mortgagee cannot claim input tax for the costs associated with a mortgagee sale. 30. A mortgagee who is a registered person and makes a mortgagee sale that is subject to the business-to-business supply of financial services rules is able to claim input tax for the costs associated with that mortgagee sale. 31. A mortgagor cannot claim input tax for the costs, incurred by the mortgagee, associated with a mortgagee sale. This Operational Statement is signed on 6 September 2017.

UNCLASSIFIED Operational Statement OS 18/02 Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents Introduction Operational statements set out the Commissioner's view of the law in respect of the matter discussed and deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This operational statement (the "Statement") sets out the process that the Commissioner will follow when issuing a notice to a taxpayer, tax advisor and/or a third party requiring the disclosure of documents, which may contain tax advice and may be subject to the right to claim non-disclosure under sections 20B to 20G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the Act). Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this Statement refer to the Act. Application This Statement updates and replaces Standard Practice Statement 05/07 Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents. The Statement incorporates amendments to the legislation (in particular the extension of the non-disclosure right in 2009 to apply to discovery and similar processes that occur during litigation), and incorporates principles established in cases since SPS 05/07 was published in 2005. The requirement to disclose the information to the Commissioner will be made pursuant to a notice requiring either access to or disclosure of information under sections 16 to 19 (collectively referred to in this Statement as an "information demand"). This Statement applies to tax advisors who may or may not be a chartered accountant, but are members of an approved advisory group. 2 UNCLASSIFIED This Statement supplements the protocol on Access to Audit Working Papers (the "protocol") that was signed between the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (now Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand) and Inland Revenue on 29 April 2008. 1 Documents that are prepared solely for audit purposes in relation to a client's accounting or tax positions and exposures constitute "audit working papers". They are the property of the auditor and not of the client and generally do not include tax advice documents. However if an inconsistency arises between this Statement and the protocol this Statement shall apply where appropriate. Documents or other communications which are legally privileged under section 20 are not subject to these requirements. The Search and Surveillance Act 2012 also has no impact on the taxpayer's right or their authorised tax advisor's right to claim non- disclosure under the Act. This Statement should be read in conjunction with the Operational Statement OS 13/02 Section 17 Notices or any statement issued in replacement. This Statement applies to information demands or discovery obligations issued on or after 1 July 2018. Background Information demands and discovery obligations 1. The Act contains specific legislative provisions which deal with requesting and obtaining information related to a taxpayer's affairs. Together with sections 6 and 6A, these provisions play an important role in enabling the Commissioner to administer the Inland Revenue Acts. 2. The Commissioner may choose to limit inquiries in respect of independent advice on the interpretation of tax laws sought by taxpayers from tax advisors. However, in circumstances where the information provided previously by the taxpayer, their tax advisor or a third party does not lead to a complete factual description of the transactions under review, or where the taxpayer, their tax advisor or a third party refuses to answer questions in relation to the transactions under review, the Commissioner may request tax advice documents. 1 Available at http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/general-articles/ga-access-to-audit- working-papers.html 3 UNCLASSIFIED 3. Subject to the right of non-disclosure, an information demand may require that tax advice documents be disclosed to resolve issues in more complex situations and where there are apparent material gaps in the information available to the Commissioner. Tax advice documents oft en contain factual information. This factual information may include information relevant to establishing the purpose or effect of the transaction or intent of the taxpayer involved if that is relevant to the statutory provisions under consideration (such as recording what has been stated to be the reason for acquiring an item of property). Inland Revenue officers are generally not concerned with the substance of the tax advice contained in the tax advice documents, but rather with the relevant facts which relate to the taxpayer's tax positions. 4. The High Court in Blakeley v C of IR (2008) 23 NZTC 21,865 considered the scope of protection against disclosure of a tax advice document provided by sections 20B to 20G.The case concerned a section 17 notice issued to the appellant requiring him to provide a list of names and IRD numbers of clients to whom he had provided tax advice in respect of certain transactions. The appellant declined to provide the information on the basis that it would involve the disclosure of a tax advice document which was protected by section 20B. The High Court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the finding of the District Court that the right to non-disclosure of a tax advice document in respect of the information required is not available to the appellant. The following observations made by the Court indicate the scope of non- disclosure right: • the protection afforded by section 20B is more confined than legal professional privilege. It is not a new substantive right of equivalent utility to legal professional privilege. It was a creature of statute and protected defined parts of a limited category of written communications. • the plain words of the legislation gave no protection to the information from disclosure sought by the Commissioner. • tax contextual information contained in the opinions would not be protected from disclosure even if the tax advice itself was. • waiver did not arise under sections 20B to 20G. The protection against disclosure provided by the legislation was not susceptible to waiver. The right to non- disclosure must be claimed by following the detailed procedure set out in section 20D. If the procedure set out in the legislation was not followed, there would be no right to non-disclosure. 4 UNCLASSIFIED 5. Where tax advice documents are referred to in an information demand, a two-step process will generally be followed (outlined in \[45 to 63) and \[73 to 83)): (1) the taxpayer (or their authorised tax advisor) claims the right of non-disclosure for documents that are eligible to be tax advice documents; and (2) if required by the Commissioner, the taxpayer (or their authorised tax advisor) discloses the factual content (i.e. the tax contextual information) of the tax advice documents. 6. Where an information demand is issued directly to a taxpayer's tax advisor the Commissioner will be as specific as practicable about the transactions to which the information demand relates, based on information the Commissioner already holds. The information demand will be made in a manner consistent with the Commissioner's information gathering powers and standard practices. 7. While not limited to cases of potential evasion or avoidance, requests to a taxpayer's tax advisor will generally involve more complex matters and will usually only be made when direct inquiry from the taxpayer has not yielded the level of information which in the Commissioner's view is reasonably required to complete her inquiry. 8. The issuing of an information demand is limited to an appropriately delegated Inland Revenue officer on behalf of the Commissioner. They will take careful consideration of the statutory requirements of the provisions which provide for the information gathering powers of the Commissioner and the Commissioner's standard practice and other relevant statements (if any). 9. The Commissioner and the taxpayer may also be subject to a discovery obligation under part 8 of the High Court Rules, which requires the parties to a proceeding to discover the existence of documents to every other party of the proceeding. In these cases the same two-step process set out in \[5\] applies. 5 UNCLASSIFIED The right to claim non-disclosure 6 UNCLASSIFIED Key Terms Tax advisor 10. A "tax advisor" is defined in section 20B(4) to mean a natural person who is subject to the code of conduct and disciplinary process of an "approved advisor group". 11. Generally, due to the professional standards imposed through the approved advisor group's code of conduct in giving tax advice, a tax advisor will be someone who is technically qualified and is experienced and competent to give advice on the operation and effect of tax laws. 12. The definition covers tax advisors in public practice such as tax advisors within professional firms and also professionals holding in-house positions involved in tax advisory work for their employer. 13. When complying with an information demand, in-house tax advisors will need to ensure that they distinguish documents which are commercial or transactional in nature such as a sale and purchase agreement, as opposed to those documents being created for the main purpose of giving tax advice such as a tax opinion. 14. Where tax advice has been provided to a taxpayer by an offshore tax advisor, that advice can only be withheld from disclosure where the tax advisor is a member of an approved tax advisory group and the tax advisor has sufficient knowledge of New Zealand tax laws. Approved advisory group 15. An "approved advisor group" is defined in section 20B(5) as a group that includes natural persons who meet all of the following requirements: • have a significant function of giving advice on the operation and effect of tax laws; and • are subject to a professional code of conduct in giving that advice; and • are subject to a disciplinary process that enforces compliance with the code of conduct; and • is approved by the Commissioner. 7 UNCLASSIFIED 16. The ability for a taxpayer to exercise their right to claim non-disclosure depends on the tax advisor who gave the advice being subject to an approved advisor's group code of conduct and disciplinary procedures at the time the tax advice document was created. 17. Typically, a tax advisor will be subject to an approved advisor group's code of conduct and disciplinary procedures because they are a member of the approved advisor group. Some organisations may allow non-members to be subject to an approved advisor group's code of conduct and disciplinary procedures under certain circumstances such as where a non-member is practising in partnership with a member of an approved advisor group. 18. The group must also be approved by the Commissioner. The Commissioner will exercise this power of approval at a high level of delegated authority having regard to the statutory requirements and other relevant considerations as may be applicable. 19. The list of approved tax advisory groups is available to view at: http://www.ird.govt. nz/taxagents/maintain/maintain-tax-agent-status.html Tax advice document 20. Whether or not a "document" is a "tax advice document" depends on whether it meets the criteria set out in section 20B(3): (3) A document is a tax advice document for a person if- (a) the document is eligible under subsection (2) to be a tax advice document for the person; and (b) the person makes a claim, under section 20D, that the document is a tax advice document; and (c) the person satisfies the requirements of sections 20E and 20F for the document. If it is not a tax advice document, it must be disclosed if required under an information demand. A "document" is defined in section 3: document means- 8 UNCLASSIFIED (a) a thing that is used to hold, in or on the thing and in any form, items of information: (b) an item of information held in or on a thing referred to in paragraph (a): (c) a device associated with a thing referred to in paragraph (a) and required for the expression, in any form, of an item of information held in or on the thing 21. The definition is wide and applies to both paper and electronic communications such as books, accounts, records, letters, faxes, reports, memos, file-notes, photographs, images, e-mails and other data however stored. 22. The right of non-disclosure only applies to documents that are "tax advice documents". It is not intended to limit the Commissioner's ability to ask general questions about a taxpayer's affairs either to a taxpayer or their tax advisor. Requirements of a tax advice document 23. Under section 20B (3), in order for a document to be a tax advice document, three requirements must be met: 1. the document must be eligible to be a tax advice document (section 20B(2)); and 2. the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor must make a claim that the document is a tax advice document (see \[58 to 59\] which set out the claim requirements); and 3. the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor must satisfy the disclosure requirements for tax contextual information (if such a disclosure is required) and disclose documents (or parts of documents) that do not meet the tax advice document requirements (see \[35 to 42\]). 24. In order to be eligible to be a tax advice document the document must have been intended to be confidential. That is the document was intended to be treated as a private document for non-public purposes, in the same way that a communication between a legal practitioner and their clients is required to be a confidential communication before legal professional privilege attaches to it. Additionally, the document must have been: • created by a person ("the taxpayer") for the main purpose of instructing a tax advisor to act for the taxpayer by giving the taxpayer advice about the operation and effect of tax laws; or 9 UNCLASSIFIED • have been created by a tax advisor (or where the tax advisor is in public practice, an employee of the tax advisor's firm whether this is a company, partnership or other business entity) for the main purpose of giving the taxpayer confidential advice about the operation and effect of tax laws; or • the document must record tax advice previously provided to the taxpayer by their tax advisor; or • the document must record research or analysis of tax laws by a tax advisor (or where the tax advisor is in public practice, an employee of the tax advisor's firm) and the document was created for the main purpose of the tax advisor providing tax advice to the taxpayer; and • the document must not have been created for the purpose of committing, or promoting or assisting the committing of, an illegal or wrongful act. Tax evasion would be an example of an illegal or wrongful act, but it would also extend to tax advice given in the course of committing some other illegal or quasi -illegal act, such as a wider act of fraud or some other crime. 25. Therefore the types of confidential documents to which the right to claim non- disclosure may apply will be those which are created in order to seek or obtain tax advice, and would not have been created except for such purpose, even though they may serve ancillary functions such as conveying factual information. 26. Documents which simply record decisions or transactions, set out calculations or summarise facts, whether or not they are part of the process of generating tax advice, will generally not be eligible to be tax advice documents. Document or forms completed for the main purpose of meeting tax compliance obligations will also not be eligible to be tax advice documents. 27. Other examples of documents which will generally not be tax advice documents are: • tax calculations and worksheets; • transfer pricing documentation ; • reports on factual matters in support of tax returns; • financial statements (including the tax notes, tax worksheets and tax provisioning calculations); • board minutes; • valuation reports; • invoices, agreements and other transaction documents; • structure diagrams; • memoranda of understanding; • tax indemnity agreements; 10 UNCLASSIFIED • term sheets; • guarantees; • compliance forms and certificates; • communications with third parties; • employment contracts; • confidentiality agreements; • bank statements and other similar documents. 28. All these types of documents will need to be disclosed in full (any advice referred to or contained in them may not be deleted or blanked out) if subject to an information demand. The above list is not intended to be an exhaustive list. 29. It is fundamental that the document must have been intended to be and remain confidential between the tax advisor and the taxpayer, and not intended to be read by third parties or members of the public. The expression "third parties" in this context however does not include the taxpayer's other advisors such as their legal advisors, financial advisors, employees of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's shareholders or owners or where the third party is subject to a confidentiality agreement. The way in which the document is treated by the taxpayer and/or the tax advisor is relevant in determining whether confidentiality has been maintained. A confidentiality obligation should exist on the part of the third party, such as is commonly the case in due diligence exercises, joint venture arrangements, insurance proposals etc. 30. If the document is eligible to be a tax advice document, the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor must make a claim that the document is a tax advice document. Refer to \[54 to 63\] which outline the procedure for making a claim. If the claim is not made in the required time period the right to claim non-disclosure will not apply to the document after the expiry of that period even if a further information demand is issued in relation to the same document or a claim for the right of nondisclosure is later made. 31. If the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor has made a claim that a document is a tax advice document, the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor must also satisfy the tax contextual information disclosure requirements if required to do so by the Commissioner. The tax contextual information disclosure requirements are outlined in \[35 to 42\]. Tax laws 32. "Tax law" is a defined term in section 3 and means: 11 UNCLASSIFIED (a) A provision of the Inland Revenue Acts or an Act that an Inland Revenue Act replaces: (b) An Order in Council or a regulation made under another tax law: (c) A non-disputable decision: (d) In relation to an obligation to provide a tax return or a tax form, also includes a provision of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 or a regulation made under that Act or the Accident Insurance Act 1998 or a regulation made under that Act of the Injury Prevention Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001 or a regulation made under that Act. 33. The tax advice must only be about New Zealand tax rules as they affect the taxpayer in question. Advice about the effect and application of tax laws in another jurisdiction (such as a country in which a controlled foreign company is resident) will not be subject to the right to claim non-disclosure. 34. Advice provided to taxpayers about non-tax issues such as accounting treatment (including materiality, provisioning, and related party disclosures), insolvency law, company and trust law will constitute tax contextual information, as discussed below. If the main purpose of the document is to give such advice, it will not be subject to the right to claim non-disclosure. Tax contextual information 35. Tax contextual information may be required to be disclosed as a result of one of the following: • in special cases, where the Commissioner issues a subsequent information demand requiring disclosure of the tax contextual information after the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor has made a claim for the nondisclosure right; or • in rare cases, where the Commissioner requires the tax contextual information as part of the original information demand. 36. The circumstances in which Inland Revenue may require disclosure of the tax contextual information under either of the above situations is discussed at \[76 to 77\]. 37. Tax contextual information means information relating to a tax advice document that falls into any of the following categories, as defined in section 20F(3): • facts or assumptions relating to the transaction identified in the information demand and to which the advice relates, whether the transaction has occurred, 12 UNCLASSIFIED or is expected to occur or is assumed to have occurred by the creator of the tax advice document (i.e. either the tax advisor or the taxpayer); • a description of steps involved or expected to be involved in the performance of the transaction; • advice related to the operation and effect of laws, other than tax laws, on the taxpayer and any related facts or assumptions that this advice is based on; • advice related to the operation and effect on the taxpayer of tax laws which relate to the collection of debts payable to the Commissioner (i.e. debt recovery issues) and any related facts or assumptions that this advice is based on; • facts or assumptions from, or relating to the preparation of, the taxpayer's financial statements, supporting worksheets or other source documents or documents containing information that the taxpayer is required to provide the Commissioner under an Inland Revenue Act. This is including tax advisor's accounting and tax workpapers which support the financial statements and/or tax return. 38. Generally, the Commissioner will seek tax contextual information in order to establish the facts relating to a transaction or series of transactions. The information sought will include relevant information such as whether the transaction took place, the names of the parties involved, the purpose of the transaction, relevant dates, amounts, conditions, formulae, etc. 39. "Assumptions" are statements or propositions that have been accepted or assumed as true for the purpose of the tax advice whether the basis for the statement or proposition is factual or not. 40. Tax contextual information may be required to be provided in relation to one or more tax advice documents requested in the same information demand. 41. If an authorised tax advisor is providing the tax contextual information, that information should reflect the advisor's understanding of the transaction. Verbatim extracts from transaction documents may be included if the tax advisor considers that the extracts are the best representation of the information in order to meet the disclosure requirements of the tax contextual information. This is optional and is a matter for the judgment of the tax advisor. 42. Tax contextual information from a tax advice document is to be disclosed to the Commissioner in a statutory declaration in the prescribed form (IR 520 form Tax contextual information disclosure). A copy of this form can be found on Inland Revenue's website: http://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/number/forms-500- 599/ir520-form-taxcontext.html 13 UNCLASSIFIED Information holder 43. An information holder is a person who has been issued with an information demand pursuant to sections 16 to 19 requiring that information holder to disclose information in relation to a taxpayer. The information holder may be a taxpayer, a taxpayer's tax advisor or an unrelated third party such as a bank. 44. Irrespective of the relationship between the information holder and the taxpayer, the non-disclosure right must be claimed by the taxpayer to whom the information demand relates (or their authorised tax advisor). Where a taxpayer and their authorised tax advisor disagree or dispute the right to claim non-disclosure or any of the disclosure requirements related to the right to claim non-disclosure, the taxpayer's position will take precedence. Process for claiming the right of non-disclosure STEP 1: The Commissioner must issue an information demand or the taxpayer and the Commissioner must be subject to a discovery obligation requiring the disclosure of a document which may be eligible to be a tax advice document 45. A claim that a document is a tax advice document can only be made where the Commissioner and the taxpayer are subject to a discovery obligation or where the Commissioner has issued the information holder with an information demand under any of the following sections: • section 16 access to premises, section 16B removal and copying of documents and section 16C removal and inspection of documents; • section 17 notice requiring production of information; • section 17A Court order for production of information or return; • section 18 inquiry before a District Court Judge; or • section 19 inquiry by the Commissioner. 46. If the information demand is a section 17 notice then the Commissioner must follow the practice set out in Operational Statement OS 13/02 Section 17 Notices or its replacement. 47. An information demand may be issued directly to a tax advisor but this action must be approved in accordance with the exercise of delegated powers conferred to Inland Revenue officers by the Commissioner. 48. Generally, Inland Revenue will only issue an information demand directly to a tax advisor where the information has not been provided voluntarily or in a timely manner by the information holder and cannot reasonably (in the opinion of the 14 UNCLASSIFIED Commissioner) be obtained or verified elsewhere. For example records may have been lost, the taxpayer may no longer be available or may have left the country, or the taxpayer or information holder is being uncooperative in regard to reasonable inquiries made by the Commissioner. 49. Other examples of when an information demand may be issued to a tax advisor include cases involving suspected tax evasion or fraud, suspected tax avoidance, and cases involving complex international transactions or transfer pricing. 50. In some cases the information demand may be issued to a third party who is not the taxpayer's tax advisor. The legislation does not require the Commissioner to advise the taxpayer or their tax advisor of the information demand. However, where this does occur, and the Commissioner considers that the information demand may include documents that may be eligible to be a tax advice document, the Commissioner's practice is that the taxpayer or their tax advisor will be notified (by the Commissioner) of the notice, so as to provide the opportunity for a claim of non- disclosure to be made. 51. The Commissioner, however, reserves the right not to advise the taxpayer of an information demand to a third party where the Commissioner considers that to do so will endanger the safety of the third party or for reasons relating to her duty to protect the integrity of the tax system. A decision not to advise the taxpayer of an information demand made to a third party will be made by a senior officer of the department. 52. The notice to the third party will refer to the non-disclosure right and the third party may choose to advise the taxpayer of the notice and so allow the taxpayer the opportunity to make a claim of non-disclosure. However in some cases the Commissioner may specifically ask the third party not to advise the taxpayer of the information demand. 53. Where the information demand requires disclosure of the tax contextual information from the outset, this will be clearly stated in the information demand. Notification to Commissioner that taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor is claiming the non-disclosure right. 54. A claim that a document is a tax advice document for a taxpayer must be made by either the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor. This is also the case where the information holder is a third party, since a third party cannot make such a claim. 15 UNCLASSIFIED 55. Where the non-disclosure right is made by a tax advisor on behalf of their client, section 20D(5) requires that the tax advisor must also include a statement that they are authorised to act on behalf of the taxpayer for the purposes of the non- disclosure right. 56. The Commissioner expects and prefers that the authorised tax advisor is the tax advisor who created the tax advice document. However if that tax advisor is unavailable, for example because the tax advisor is not in New Zealand, or has left the organisation originally instructed to provide the advice, or that organisation has ceased to operate, then an appropriate alternative tax advisor may be the authorised tax advisor. 57. Although the legislation does not provide for the claim to be made on a prescribed form, the Commissioner prefers that the claim that a document is a tax advice document be made on the IR 519 form Tax advice document claim which has been designed for this purpose. This form is available at: http://www.ird.govt.nz/formsguides/number/forms-500-599/ir519-form- nondisclosure. html 58. The claim that a document is a tax advice document must contain certain information. Where the document was created by the taxpayer (i.e. a document instructing a tax advisor to provide advice on the operation and effect of tax laws), the claim must contain the following: • a brief description of the form (such as a letter, email, report) and content (such as request for tax advice concerning fringe benefit tax) of the document; • the name of the tax advisor for whom the document was intended; and • the date on which the document was created (that is, finalised or sent to the taxpayer's tax advisor). 59. Where the document was created by a tax advisor the claim must contain the following: • a brief description of the form (such as a letter, research paper, summary of phone conference, email) and content (such as tax advice concerning fringe benefit tax, depreciation, treatment of bloodstock) of the document; and • the statute, enactment or regulation and the type of revenue such as income tax, fringe benefit tax, GST, PAYE or withholding tax which was the subject of the tax advice; and • the name and if possible the contact details of the tax advisor who gave the tax advice in relation to the document; and 16 UNCLASSIFIED • the name of the approved advisor group that the tax advisor belonged to when the document was created; and • the date on which the document was created (that is, finalised or sent to the taxpayer). 60. Different versions of the "same" tax advice document, where the content of the various versions are significantly different, may need to be separately identified in the IR519 form. 61. The following table sets out the time periods within which a claim that a document is a tax advice document must be made (section 20D(4)): Type of information demand/obligation Due date for non-disclosure claim Access to premises for information (section 16 notice, sections 16B and 16C) The date the right of inspection or removal is exercised, or later date agreed with Inland Revenue Information demand (section 17 notice) The later of the date given by the Commissioner or 28 days after the date of the section 17 notice Court order for information (issued under section 17A or section 18) The date the court requires the information Inquiry by Commissioner (section 19) The date the Commissioner requires the information Discovery obligation The date required by the discovery obligation 62. Where the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor has not notified the Commissioner of their claim of non-disclosure within the above stated time periods the claim will be invalid. A further claim may not be made at a later date even if the document happens to be the subject of a later information demand. Accordingly it is recommended that the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor should notify the Commissioner of a claim that a document is a tax advice document as soon as practicable after receiving an information demand. 63. The Commissioner may extend the above time periods for making a claim of nondisclosure in exceptional circumstances if requested to do so by the taxpayer (or their authorised tax advisor). Any request for such an extension must be made before the end of the time frame advised in the information demand and any extension will be granted at the discretion of the Commissioner. Any change to the 17 UNCLASSIFIED time period will be notified to the taxpayer in writing. The Commissioner will (as necessary) take the following matters into account when extending the time period for making a claim of non-dis closure: • the complexity of the situation; • the compliance history of the taxpayer; • issues related to the timing of the notice; • the difficulty which the taxpayer may have in making the claim; and • other factors generally relevant to the exercise of the relevant statutory power. Limitations on the right to claim non-disclosure 64. If a document required to be disclosed under an information demand does not meet the requirements of being a tax advice document, that document is ineligible to be a tax advice document. In such circumstances, the information holder is required to disclose that document pursuant to the requirements of the information demand. This includes attachments (such as appendices, schedules and notes) to tax advice documents where the attachment is not eligible to be a tax advice document. 65. Examples of documents (including those that are attached to another document which is a tax advice document) that are generally not eligible to be tax advice documents include, but are not limited to: • business and management records; • financial statements, work papers, and notes to the financial accounts; • letters of engagement; • numerical calculations compiled for the purpose of calculating a taxpayer's tax liability; • transfer pricing documentation; • legal transaction documents such as contracts, licence agreements, loan documentation, guarantees, deeds, title documents, tax indemnity agreements and letters between the transaction parties; • databases and spreadsheets; • diagrams demonstrating transactions; • documents created by the tax advisor for main purposes other than giving a taxpayer advice on the operation and effect of tax laws, such as advising on employment law, company law, securities law, other regulatory requirements, or the accounting or financial treatment of transactions, etc. 18 UNCLASSIFIED 66. If the taxpayer or their tax advisor does not disclose the documents or part of documents which are not tax advice documents by the required date set out in the information demand, the taxpayer or their tax advisor may be liable for penalties as set out in Part 9. It is therefore important that care is taken to identify those documents which may be tax advice documents from those other documents or parts of documents which are not eligible to be tax advice documents. Treatment of potential tax advice documents 67. Section 20C contains specific provisions dealing with the treatment of a potentially eligible tax advice document while the non-disclosure claim is being established. 68. The document will be regarded as being a tax advice document from the date of the information demand or discovery obligation until the earlier of: • the date by which the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor is required to claim the document is a tax advice document; or • the date on which the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor informs the Commissioner that the person is waiving the right to claim non-disclosure over the document (including where the document is provided as it is not included in a claim for non-disclosure). 69. As advised above, if a non-disclosure claim is not made within the statutory time frame the document loses its tax advice document status. 70. If the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor claims a document is a tax advice document within the statutory time frame the document must be treated as a tax advice document from the date the Commissioner is advised of the claim until one of the following events occurs: • the District Court, or a court or Taxation Review Authority (that the discovery obligation is in proceedings before) rules that the document is not a tax advice document; • the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor agrees in writing that the document is not a tax advice document; • the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor withdraws in writing the claim that the document is a tax advice document; • an approved advisor group informs the Commissioner that the authorised tax advisor is or was not a member of the approved advisor group at the time that the authorised tax advisor claimed and was required to be a member of the approved advisor group. 19 UNCLASSIFIED 71. While the non-disclosure claim is being considered a copy of the document is to be held in a secure place. 72. A "secure place" includes a lockable cupboard, locker or safe at the tax advisor's business premises and secure electronic storage. It can also include the non-public parts of a tax advisor's offices where access to that area is limited, and protected or controlled by the tax advisor. STEP 2: Provision of tax contextual information in statutory declaration 73. An information holder who is required to disclose information under an information demand or discovery obligation must also disclose tax contextual information relating to any document that the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor claims to be a tax advice document, if required to do so by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may require disclosure of the tax contextual information either as part of the original information demand, discovery obligation or may require disclosure through a subsequent information demand at a later date. 74. The discretion to require disclosure of the tax contextual information will be exercised sparingly in order to minimise compliance costs, and so that the spirit of the nondisclosure right rules are not undermined. Accordingly, exercising this discretion will be limited to officers at an appropriately high level of delegated authority. 75. The Commissioner will notify the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor if disclosure of the tax contextual information is required either as part of the original information demand or in a separate information demand. A decision to require disclosure of the tax contextual information will be made after the Commissioner has assessed the information already provided under the information demand and after considering the nature of the documents for which the non-disclosure claim has been claimed. Generally the Commissioner will require the disclosure of tax contextual information after the information demand has been issued where: • there appears to be material gaps in the information available; • there is an issue of credibility in respect of the information already held by Inland Revenue; • inconsistent information already provided needs to be verified; or • there is considerable factual complexity requiring clarification and there are no other reasonable sources for that information. 76. Where the Commissioner considers it necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system, an original information demand may require the tax contextual information 20 UNCLASSIFIED to be disclosed at the same time the information demand is given. This is likely to occur: • in circumstances involving suspected evasion or other suspected criminal action; • where sections 16 or 16B are being applied; • where the transactions in question are particularly complex and the evidence is inconsistent, and there may be insufficient time for the Inland Revenue to properly complete the investigation within the timebar period; and/or • where there is a history of non-compliance by the taxpayer or associated persons. 77. The disclosure of the tax contextual information must be in a statutory declaration in the prescribed IR 520 form Tax contextual information disclosure. 78. The statutory declaration contained in the IR 520 form must be made by an authorised tax advisor who has not been barred from making a statutory declaration. A tax advisor may be barred from making a statutory declaration if a Court has so ordered where the tax advisor has previously been convicted of an offence under one or more of the following provisions: • section 111 of the Crimes Act 1961 - false statements or declarations; • section 143(1)(b) - not supplying information when required to by tax law; • section 143A(1)(b) or (c) - knowingly does not provide information when required to by law or knowingly provides altered, false, incomplete or misleading information; • section 143B(1)(b) or (c) - knowingly not supplying information when required to by tax law, or providing altered, false, incomplete or misleading information; or • section 143H - obstruction. 79. Generally, the Commissioner prefers that the authorised tax advisor making the statutory declaration will be the same tax advisor or a member of the same firm which created the tax advice document for which the non-disclosure right is claimed (and where possible be the same authorised tax advisor who claimed the non- disclosure right on behalf of the taxpayer). 80. The statutory declaration must be sworn before: • a Solicitor of the High Court of New Zealand; or • a Justice of the Peace; or • any other person authorised by law under the Oaths and Declarations Act 1957 to take a statutory declaration but not including officers of Inland Revenue. 21 UNCLASSIFIED 81. Where the information demand requires disclosure of the tax contextual information, that information, including the IR 520 form, may be delivered within the time periods outlined below, together with any documents which are not tax advice documents and that are required to be disclosed under the information demand to the officer of the Department authorised by the Commissioner to receive the documents. This generally will be the officer listed in the information demand. Type of information demand/ obligation Due date for tax contextual information Access to premises for information (section 16 notice, sections 16B and 16C) The date determined by the Commissioner when requiring the statutory declaration. Information demand (section 17 notice) The later of the date given by the Commissioner on the notice or 28 days after the date of the notice requiring the disclosure of the tax contextual information. Court order for information (issued under section 17A or section 18) The date the court requires the production of the information. Inquiry by Commissioner (section 19) The date the Commissioner requires the production of the information. Discovery obligation The date required by the discovery obligation. 82. The Commissioner may extend the above time periods in exceptional circumstances if requested to do so by the taxpayer (or their authorised tax advisor). An extension may be granted at the discretion of the Commissioner and any change to the time period will be notified to the taxpayer. 83. The Commissioner may take the following matters into account when extending the time period for providing tax contextual information: • the complexity of the situation; • the compliance history of the taxpayer; • issues related to the timing of the notice; • the difficulty which the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor may have in providing the information; and • other factors generally relevant to the exercise of the relevant statutory power. Section 16 information demands and tax contextual information 84. Where the Commissioner exercises her powers under sections 16, 16B or 16C, disclosure of the tax contextual information in the information demand related to the exercise of the section 16, 16B or 16C powers will be required. 22 UNCLASSIFIED 85. A taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor will need to ensure that they have met the following requirements by the relevant statutory time period(s) set out in the information demand in relation to sections 16, 16B and 16C: • all documents required to be disclosed under the information demand which are not eligible to be tax advice documents have been provided; • if the non-disclosure right is being claimed the Commissioner has been notified of that and the required information in the IR 519 form has been provided; and • the tax contextual information for all documents which are subject to the nondisclosure right has been provided. Voluntarily providing eligible documents 86. Nothing in this Statement precludes a taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor from voluntarily providing documents which may be eligible to be tax advice documents. However taxpayers and their authorised tax advisors should be aware that any documents which may be eligible to be tax advice documents but which are provided voluntarily will constitute a waiver of the right to claim non-disclosure over those particular documents. 87. Nothing in this Statement precludes a taxpayer from meeting their obligations under Part 9. For example, it will commonly be the case that tax advice documents need to be disclosed to demonstrate that the taxpayer took reasonable care in taking a particular tax position. Challenge by the Commissioner 88. The legislation provides that the Commissioner may apply to the District Court (this may be included in the course of a section 18 inquiry), or the court or authority the particular matter is before, for an order determining one or more of the following: • whether a document is a tax advice document for the taxpayer; • whether information provided by a taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor is tax contextual information for a tax advice document; or • whether the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor is required to provide a more detailed or better description of tax contextual information in relation to a document. 23 UNCLASSIFIED 89. As part of an application by the Commissioner, the District Court Judge, court or authority may require disclosure to the court of the document which is the subject of the order. Disclosure of information to approved advisor group 90. Section 81 allows the Commissioner to supply information to an approved advisor group about an action or omission by a person who is or purports to be a member of the approved advisor group where the Commissioner considers that act or omission to be a breach of the tax advisor's responsibilities in relation to the non-disclosure right. 91. The Commissioner would only consider this type of disclosure in specific circumstances such as: • the provision of false or incomplete information in the statutory declaration required for the disclosure of tax contextual information; • where a tax advisor has knowingly failed to disclose facts or assumptions relating to a transaction which is the subject of the tax advice document; • where the tax advisor has failed to provide tax contextual information when required to do so by the Commissioner under or pursuant to an information demand. This Operational Statement is signed on 16 August 2018. Rob Wells Manager, Technical Standards
UNCLASSIFIED Operational Statement OS 19/04a Commissioner’s statement on using a kilometre rate for business running of a motor vehicle – deductions Introduction Operational statements set out the Commissioner’s view of the law in respect of the matter discussed and deal with practical issues arising out of the administration on the Inland Revenue Acts. This Statement explains how the Commissioner’s kilometre rates are to be applied. Future rates will be set each year as the necessary third-party data becomes available. This Statement updates and replaces Operation Statement OS 18/01 Commissioner’s statement on use of a kilometre rate for expenditure incurred for business use of a motor vehicle, issued in July 2018. The topic of using the Commissioner’s kilometre rates is made up of two parts. Part “a” deals with deductions for the business use of a motor vehicle. Part “b” deals with the tax treatment of reimbursement payments made by an employer to an employee where the employee uses their private motor vehicle for employment purposes. All references to “motor vehicles” and “vehicles” are referring to motor cars, vans, and tray-back vehicles such as coupe utilities. The rates do not apply to motor cycles or scooters (petrol or electric). All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007. Deductions for business running of a motor vehicle using a kilometre rate Where a person intends to claim an expense deduction for a motor vehicle that is used partly for business purposes and partly for non-taxable purposes, they must calculate the proportion of business use using either a logbook or actual records. Under s DE 2, a person may use one of two methods to calculate the deduction for that proportion of business use, namely: • A cost method based on actual costs; or • A kilometre rate method. UNCLASSIFIED Operational Practice Summary 1. A person must determine the business use of a motor vehicle against the total kilometres travelled by that motor vehicle. A logbook (explained at \[18\] below), diary, calendar or other suitable method may be used for this purpose. This information will be used to calculate the income tax deduction. 2. A deduction can be made in respect of the business portion of their actual motor vehicle costs. This is known as the cost method. Alternatively, a person may use the s DE 12 kilometre rates set annually by the Commissioner for each vehicle type. This is known as the kilometre rate method. 3. A person wishing to use the kilometre rate method must make an election to use this method. That election will apply until the vehicle is disposed of. 4. The election must be made on a vehicle by vehicle basis and be made in the year the vehicle is acquired or first used for business purposes. The election to use the kilometre rate method is made by using this method in the person’s return of income. If no election is made to use the kilometre rate method the person is deemed to have elected to use the cost method. In either case, the election is irrevocable. 5. The kilometre rates are set by the Commissioner by reference to industry figures that represent the average cost of operating a motor vehicle. The rates do not consider regional price variances or regional fuel taxes. 6. The various rates for selected vehicle types are made up of two tiers. 7. The Tier One rate is a combination of the vehicle’s fixed and running costs. The Tier One rate applies for the business portion of the first 14,000 kilometres travelled by the motor vehicle in an income year. 8. The Tier Two rates provide only the running costs. The Tier Two rate must be used for the business portion of any travel after the vehicle has covered 14,000kms total travel in any income year. 9. The following are the rates per kilometre that apply for the 2018/2019 income year: 2018/2019 Kilometre Rates Vehicle Type Tier One Rate Tier Two rate Petrol or Diesel 79 cents 30 cents Petrol Hybrid 19 cents Electric 9 cents 10. A person wishing to use the kilometre rate method will be required to keep a record of all travel undertaken by the vehicle. This requirement may be met through the use of a logbook in accordance with ss DE 6 to DE 11, or some other recording method such as a diary. Paragraphs 18 to 20 of this Statement contain more information on logbooks. Note that although not all travel (non-business as well as business travel) needs to be recorded, a person who uses the kilometre rate method will need to be able to show whether, and when, the vehicle exceeds the 14,000 annual kilometres. 11. The cost method must be used for any vehicle type not included in the above table. UNCLASSIFIED 12. There is no depreciation deduction or recovery of depreciation where a person has elected to use the s DE 12 kilometre rate method for a motor vehicle. 13. Close companies may use the s DE 2 cost method or kilometre rate method as an alternative to paying FBT where a motor vehicle is provided to a shareholder employee, so long as that close company’s only non-cash benefit is the availability of a motor vehicle for the private use of the shareholder. The close company must make an irrevocable election to use s DE 2 to calculate the amount of their deduction. 14. The election by a close company to make deductions under s DE 2 instead of applying the FBT rules must be made within the time for filing the company’s return of income in which the election is made. Elections are only available for vehicles acquired or first used for business purposes on or after 1 April 2017. 15. Where a close company elects to use subpart DE to calculate the cost of business use of a motor vehicle, any interest deductions are to be included in those calculations. This means that a close company applying subpart DE will need to ensure that any interest deduction under ss DB 7 or 8 does not relate to a motor vehicle. Detailed Discussion Legislation changes 16. The Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 introduced a number of amendments that allow a person to use a simplified method of calculating deductions for motor vehicles that are used for both business and other purposes, such as for private purposes. These changes came in to effect from the 2017/2018 income year and are explained in detail in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 4, May 2017 at page 70. This can be viewed on Inland Revenue’s website here. 17. Without completely restating that explanation, the key features in respect of claiming motor vehicle expenses where a vehicle is used for both business and non- taxable purposes are as follows: • Instead of making a claim for the business use of a motor vehicle based on the actual costs, a taxpayer may elect to have a deduction for the business use portion based on a kilometre rate method. • In respect of the kilometre rate method, the Commissioner will set rates by reference to industry figures that represent the average cost of using average motor vehicles. • There is no longer a 5,000km limit restricting the use of these rates. • The rates will be divided into two Tiers – o The first Tier will provide for deductions based on the recovery of both the vehicle’s fixed costs and the per kilometre running costs; o The second Tier will provide for the recovery of the vehicle’s per kilometre running costs only. • The Tier One rate is limited to the first 14,000 kilometres (total kilometres in each income year) as the fixed costs of the vehicle ownership would be over UNCLASSIFIED deducted with increasing usage if a single rate were used. The Tier Two rates apply for any use above 14,000 kilometres. • The election to use the kilometre rate method applies on a per vehicle basis and is irrevocable (s DE 2B(3) refers), so a person may not switch back and forth between methods for the same vehicle. • The election is made by using this method in a tax return for the year in which the vehicle is acquired or first used for business purposes. • For a vehicle held at 1 April 2017, the election must be made in the return of income for the 2017/2018 income year unless the vehicle is disposed of during that income year. Note, there are different rules that apply to close companies wishing to adopt the kilometre rates instead of paying FBT for shareholder employees. This is further explained below. • If a person uses a vehicle for dual purposes (business and other purposes) but does not make an election to use the kilometre rate method, they are deemed to have made an irrevocable election to use the cost method (s DE 2B(3) refers). • There is no depreciation deduction or recovery of depreciation for a motor vehicle where a person has elected to use the s DE 12 kilometre rate method for that motor vehicle because the Tier One rate includes a depreciation calculation. • Where a close company’s only non-cash benefit is the availability of a motor vehicle for the private use of a shareholder, that close company may use s DE 2 as an alternative to paying FBT provided that close company also makes an election to apply the kilometre rate method to calculate the amount of their deduction. • The election by a close company to make deductions using s DE 2 instead of applying the FBT rules must be made within the time for filing the company’s relevant return of income. • Where a close company uses s DE 2 to calculate the cost of business use of a motor vehicle, any interest deductions are included in those calculations. This means that there is no separate interest deduction in respect of that vehicle under ss DB 7 or 8. Use of logbooks 18. Sections DE 6 to DE 11 provide the rules for establishing the proportion of business use of a motor vehicle. Further detail can be found here i (link to logbook page on IR website). These rules provide that a person may keep a logbook for a test period of at least 90 consecutive days. 19. That logbook test period is used to establish the average proportion of travel by the vehicle for business purposes during the logbook term (up to three years). This proportion may be used for deductions using the cost method or where the taxpayer has elected to use the kilometre rate method. 20. In the absence of a logbook (or actual records), s DE 4(2) limits any deductions to a maximum of 25% as a proportion of business use of a motor vehicle, provided, of course, that such a percentage can be justified. For the Tier-One rate, this equates to the first 3,500 business kilometres (14,000 x 25%). UNCLASSIFIED Record of total kilometres travelled each income year 21. A person who has elected to use the kilometre rate method must record their odometer reading every balance date for each vehicle covered by an election so that they can determine whether the vehicle has travelled 14,000 kilometres (business and non-business) for the year. This is because the deduction for the kilometre rate method is based on a Two-Tier approach where the Tier One rate is only available for the first 14,000 total kilometres. Goods and Services Tax 22. The Commissioner’s kilometre rates are calculated on a GST inclusive basis. However, input tax cannot be claimed on these estimated kilometre rates. GST may only be claimed on an actual basis with the appropriate tax invoices being held at the time of claiming. The following are examples using the kilometre rate method to calculate deductions for the 2018/2019 income year: Example one – Greater than 14,000 kms travelled – log book maintained: The taxpayer uses their petrol car for both business and private purposes. The previous log book test period calculates that 60% of the travel is for business purposes. The car travelled a total of 20,000 kilometres for the 2018/2019 income year. Deduction: Tier One 14,000 x $0.79 x 60% = 6,636.00 Tier Two 6,000 x $0.30 x 60% = 1,080.00 Total deduction $7,716.00 UNCLASSIFIED Example two – Greater than 14,000 kms travelled- no log book: The taxpayer uses their petrol car for both business and private purposes. No log book breakdown or other record of motor vehicle use is maintained. However, it is known that the car travelled a total of 20,000 kilometres for the 2018/2019 income year and at least 25% (or 5,000km) of this travel was for business purposes. Deduction: Tier One 3,500 x $0.79 = 2,765.00 Tier Two 1,500 x $0.30 = 450.00 Total deduction $3,215.00 This Operational Statement is signed on 16 August 2019.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Operational Statement OS 19/04b Commissioner’s statement on using a kilometre rate for employee reimbursement of a motor vehicle Introduction Operational statements set out the Commissioner’s view of the law in respect of the matter discussed and deal with practical issues arising out of the administration on the Inland Revenue Acts. This Statement explains the acceptable method to establish the tax-exempt portion of an amount paid to an employee as reimbursement of expenditure incurred by that employee where the employee uses their private motor vehicle in the employer’s business. Employers may reimburse their employee based on the actual expenditure incurred by that employee. Alternatively, s CW 17(3) provides that an employer may make a reasonable estimate of expenditure likely to be incurred by an employee or group of employees. This Statement updates and replaces Operation Statement OS 18/01 Commissioner’s statement on use of a kilometre rate for expenditure incurred for business use of a motor vehicle, issued in July 2018. Information on the use of the Commissioner’s kilometre rates is dealt with in two parts. Part “a” explains the deductions for the business use of a motor vehicle. Part “b” (this part) deals with the tax treatment of reimbursement payments made by an employer to an employee where the employee uses their private motor vehicle for employment purposes. All references to “motor vehicles” and “vehicles” are referring to motor cars, vans, and tray-back vehicles such as coupe utilities. The rates do not apply to motorcycles or scooters (petrol or electric). It should be emphasised that the Commissioner is not determining or suggesting what amount an employer must pay to reimburse and employee for the business use of their private vehicle. That is a matter for the employer and employee to agree upon. In this statement the Commissioner is merely confirming that the use of the s DE 12 kilometre rates is an acceptable method of calculating a tax-exempt portion of any reimbursement paid as provided under s CW 17(3). All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007. Who does this statement apply to? UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] As stated above, the kilometre rate method is available to employees. “Employee” is defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 and includes a person who is entitled to receive a PAYE income payment. While such a payment includes a schedular payment, this statement only applies where the payment is made on behalf of an employer. Who does the statement not apply to? • A person who receives the payment in respect of their own business such as a business call out fee. • A trustee of a trust. • A partner of a partnership. • Volunteers (although different rules may exempt some payments. Refer here (link to Volunteer payments and expenses page on IR website). • Elected officials. Application This statement applies to employee reimbursements made from 16 August 2019. Summary 1. This statement explains how to calculate the tax-exempt portion of any payment made by an employer to reimburse an employee when the employee uses their private motor vehicle in the employer’s business by reference to the use of the Commissioner’s kilometre rates. 2. The kilometre rates are set by the Commissioner by reference to industry figures that represent the average cost of operating a motor vehicle. The various rates for selected vehicle types are made up of two tiers. The rates do not consider regional fuel price variances or regional fuel taxes. 3. The Tier One rate is a combination of the vehicle’s fixed and running costs. The Tier One rate applies for the employment related portion of the first 14,000 kilometres travelled by the motor vehicle in a year. Beyond that the relevant Tier Two rate, which is only the running costs, applies for the employment related portion of any travel in excess of 14,000 kilometres. 4. The following are the rates per kilometre that apply from 30 May 2019: Kilometre Rates Vehicle Type Tier One Rate Tier Two rate Petrol or Diesel 79 cents 30 cents Petrol Hybrid 19 cents Electric 9 cents 5. An employee wishing to use the kilometre rate to calculate the exempt portion of a reimbursement payment must maintain a logbook or be able to provide other evidence that establishes the employment use of the vehicle for an income year. Note that even where the employee records a logbook test period in accordance with the rules in s DE 6 to DE 11, the annual kilometres travelled must still be recorded so that it is known whether and when the 14,000km total travel for that vehicle is reached each year. 6. In the absence of records as set out in the preceding paragraph, the use of the Tier One rates will be limited to the first 3,500 business kilometres. The Tier Two rates may be used for the kilometres travelled for employment purposes above the 3,500 kilometre threshold. Operational Practice UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 7. Where the employee maintains a logbook (explained at paragraph 11 below), or other evidence that establishes the proportion of employment use for an income year, the calculation of the exempt portion of reimbursement may be based on the kilometre rate set by Inland Revenue. The Tier One rate can be applied for the business portion of the first 14,000 kms (total) travelled by the vehicle in each income year, after which the Tier Two rates will apply. Even where the employee records a logbook test period in accordance with the rules in s DE 6 to DE 11, the annual kilometres travelled must still be monitored so that it is known whether/when the 14,000 kilometre threshold is reached each year. 8. However, where no logbook (or other record) is maintained, the use of the Tier One rate to calculate the exemption for employee reimbursement is limited to the first 3,500 kilometres travelled for employment purposes. The Tier Two rates may be used for kilometres travelled for employment purposes above the 3,500km kilometre threshold. 9. The 3,500 kilometres is based on 25% of the average annual expected (14,000) kilometres travelled for each motor vehicle. 25% is the maximum percentage allowed for business deductions where no logbook is maintained. 10. The changes to the business deductions take effect for the 2018 income year onwards and require a slightly different approach and calculation of those rates. Changes with regard to employee reimbursement will always be subject to a time lag using those figures. As such, for the 2019/2020 income year employers may reimburse employees using the new rates from the date of this Statement. Use of logbooks 11. Sections DE 6 to DE 11 provide the rules for establishing the proportion of business use of a motor vehicle. Further detail can be found here (link to logbook page on IR website). These rules provide that a person may keep a logbook for a test period of at least 90 consecutive days. 12. That logbook test period is used to establish the average proportion of travel by the vehicle for business purposes during the logbook term (up to three years). Record of total kilometres travelled each income year 13. An employee being reimbursed using the Commissioner’s kilometre rate should record their odometer reading every balance date for each vehicle covered by the reimbursement so that they can determine whether a particular vehicle has travelled 14,000 kilometres (business and non-business) for the year. This is because the reimbursement for the kilometre rate method is based on a two-tier approach where the Tier One rate is only available for the first 14,000 total kilometres. Alternatively, in the case where no log book is kept, the employer may treat any reimbursement after the first 3,500 kilometres (25%) at the tier two rate. Of course, a test period may establish a different percentage of employment related travel (refer example 3 below). Use of third-party data 14. It is acceptable to use third party data to assist in making such an estimate although care must be taken to ensure capital/fixed costs are not over represented in the rates applied. This is likely to require some division of the rates to isolate the UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] running costs from the fixed/capital costs, similar to the two-tier system in the Commissioner’s kilometre rates. Goods and Services Tax 15. The Commissioner’s kilometre rates are calculated on a GST inclusive basis. However, input tax cannot be claimed on the estimated allowances paid to reimburse an employee. GST input tax may only be claimed on an actual basis with the appropriate tax invoice being held at the time of claiming. The following are examples using the kilometre rate method to calculate employee reimbursement for the 2019/2020 income year: Example One - Single Journey – No Logbook • Employee used their private vehicle for a single 65km journey for their employment and did not maintain a logbook. • They are entitled to treat any reimbursement as tax-free for the first 3,500 employment related kilometres at the Tier One rate. • The employer must keep a record of how many employment related kilometres are travelled in the income year (for that vehicle) because any kilometres over 3,500 will only be tax-free calculated at the Tier Two rate. • The calculation (assuming the 3,500 km figure was not breached) would be: 65km x 0.79 cents (the Tier One rate) = $51.35 tax free reimbursement Example Two - Regular Journey – No Logbook • Employee used their private vehicle, a petrol-powered motor vehicle, for a regular 65km journey for their employment and did not maintain a logbook. • They are entitled to treat any reimbursement as tax-free for the first 3,500 employment related kilometres at the Tier One rate. • The employer must keep a record of how many employment related kilometres are travelled in the income year (for that vehicle) because any kilometres over 3,500 will only be tax-free calculated at the Tier Two rate. • The calculation (assuming the 3,500 km figure was breached two months earlier) would be: 65km x 0.30 cents (the Tier 2 rate) = $19.50 tax free reimbursement UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example Three - Regular Journey – Trial Logbook • Employee used their private vehicle, a petrol hybrid-powered motor vehicle, for a regular 65km journey for their employment and did maintain a logbook (albeit for a three-month trial period). • Employee’s logbook evidences that the vehicle is used 40% for employment related purposes and 60% for private/other use • They are entitled to treat any reimbursement as tax-free for the first 40% of the vehicles total kilometres up to the first 14,000 at the Tier One rate. • The employee must notify the employer when the annual kilometres reaches 14,000. This is because any kilometres from that point on will only be tax-free calculated at the Tier Two rate. • Alternatively, the employer could keep a record of the employment kilometres and use the Tier Two calculation once the claim reached 5,600 kilometres (40% of 14,000). Using this alternative approach will mean that the employee will not need to keep any records beyond the three-month trial logbook period. • The calculation (assuming the 5,600 km figure was breached two months earlier) would be: 65km x 0.19 cents (the Tier Two rate) = $12.35 tax free reimbursement This Operational Statement is signed on 16 August 2019 Rob Wells Manager, Technical Standards, OCTC UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Agreed to reimburse using IR kilometre rates. Are full records or is a logbook maintained? Yes No Use Tier O ne for employment related kms for the first 14,000 total kilometres and Tier Two rates after that. Tier Two rates are based on vehicle type. Use Tier One rate for first 3,500 business kilometres and Tier Two rates after that. Tier Two rates are based on vehicle type. Reimbursements should be based on the cost method or some other appropriate method. Reimbursement must be supported by evidence. No Yes
UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Income tax treatment of accommodation provided to employees Issued: 10 June 2021 OS 21/01 Operational statements set out the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s view of the law in respect of the matter discussed and deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This statement is intended to clarify and simplify the tax rules around employer-provided accommodation. All legislative references in this Statement are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless specified otherwise.

They may provide the accommodation directly or fund the cost of it - by paying the cost on behalf of the employee, by reimbursing the employee for the cost incurred, or by paying the employee an accommodation allowance. Generally, where an employer incurs expenditure that gives rise to a private or domestic benefit to an employee in connection with their employment that expenditure is taxable to the employee. The provision of accommodation or the funding of the cost of accommodation is an example of this kind of expenditure. The general rule where an employer provides accommodation (whether directly or by funding it) is that the employer must withhold and pay the resulting PAYE on the value of what the employee receives. Despite this general rule, in specific circumstances accommodation related to an employee’s role is exempt from tax. This Statement deals with the tax treatment of:  the provision of accommodation by the employer or the payment of an accommodation allowance to the employee;  reimbursement by the employer of accommodation expenditure incurred by an employee (also known as expenditure on account). The purpose of this Statement is to clarify when these circumstances apply and to assist in determining the amount of tax payable. The Statement is divided into two parts: Part 1 covers when employer-provided accommodation will be taxable, and Part 2 covers how to calculate the resulting tax liability. Examples are provided throughout the statement to illustrate the outcome in different scenarios. Employers often provide not only accommodation but also travel for their employees. These employers may find it useful to refer to the Commissioner’s position on employer provided travel: Operational Statement OS 19/05 : Employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace – income tax (PAYE) and fringe benefit tax (Inland Revenue, 2019). OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Summary of approach 1. In determining whether accommodation provided to an employee is taxable the following should be considered: Does what is being provided to the employee fall within the definition of “accommodation” in the Act? 2. Some types of accommodation are specifically excluded from the definition such as a room, berth or other lodging provided on a mobile workplace such as a ship, a truck or an oil rig or accommodation provided in a remote location outside New Zealand. If the accommodation is excluded, then it is not taxable. (See the discussion from \[7\] to \[12\]) The second question is: Even if the accommodation is not excluded, do any of the exemptions apply? 3. Even if what is provided is within the statutory definition of “accommodation”, it may still be exempt from tax if it falls into one of the expressly provided for exemption categories:  out-of-town secondments and projects; 1  ongoing multiple workplaces; 2  meetings, conferences and training courses. 3 See the discussion in \[13\] to \[47\]. 4. Once it has been established that the accommodation provided is taxable, the value of the accommodation provided needs to be determined. Generally, the value of the accommodation is based on the market value of what is supplied, but specific rules may vary this. This is addressed in more detail from \[48\] onward. 1 Section CW 16B. 2 Section CW 16F. 3 Section CW 16D. OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Application of this statement 5. This statement clarifies the Commissioner’s existing position on the tax treatment of employer provided accommodation to an employee. Definitions 6. In this Statement:  Employer includes a person, who, in connection with the employment or service of an employee of the employer: o provides accommodation for the employee; or o pays an amount for the employee’s accommodation.  Employer-provided accommodation means: o accommodation an employer organises and pays for; o accommodation an employee organises but the employer pays for; o accommodation an employer reimburses an employee for; or o an allowance paid to an employee by their employer to cover the cost of accommodation.  Home means a dwelling the employee uses as their residence.  Hometown means the city or town where the employee’s home is located.  Workplace means a particular place or base: o at which an employee performs their employment duties; or o from which an employee’s duties are allocated. This means that a workplace is not confined to premises of the employer but can also be any place from which the employee performs employment duties, which could be a client’s premises.  A distant workplace is a workplace that is not within reasonable daily travelling distance of the employee’s home. OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Part 1: Is taxable accommodation provided to the employee? Is what is supplied to the employee “accommodation” under the Act? 7. Accommodation is defined in section CE 1(2) as including “board or lodging, and the use of a house or living premises (or part thereof), whether permanent or temporary”. 8. Ordinarily, “board or lodging” refers to the provision of the employee’s meals and somewhere to sleep. 9. What is considered accommodation under the Act is, therefore, quite broad, so all manner of living arrangements can fall within the definition. As discussed above accommodation includes both accommodation directly provided by the employer, paid for by the employer, or paid for by the employee (which is then reimbursed by the employer). Example 1 Barbara, Karen and Vanessa all live and work in Wellington and are employees of an apartment developer. Their employer has just completed an apartment building. Three apartments in the building are still vacant. As a bonus to the employees for their good work, the employer offers each of them the right to live in their own apartment rent-free for 12 months. Barbara moves into an apartment and lives there for 12 months. Karen already has an apartment of her own. She asks if, instead of moving into one of the apartments, she could have money instead - to the value of the new apartment’s weekly rental. Her employer agrees and pays her that amount per week as an accommodation allowance. By the time Vanessa decides whether she will take up the offer, all the remaining apartments have already sold. Vanessa decides to rent an apartment from one of the new purchasers, and her employer agrees to pay the rent to that owner on Vanessa’s behalf. OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Each employee in this example has received accommodation from their employer for the purposes of the Act. The accommodation will be taxable to each employee to the value of the accommodation received. 10. As accommodation provided to employees is taxable income to them, their employer is typically obliged to withhold the tax payable on their behalf (like a salary and wage payment). Inland Revenue is aware that some employers choose to “gross up” these payments to the employee – in essence paying for the tax arising from the accommodation on the employee’s behalf instead of deducting the tax from the employee’s wages. 11. Some types of accommodation are explicitly excluded from the broad definition, and as a result are not subject to tax. These types of accommodation are:  a berth, room or other lodging provided on a mobile workplace such as a ship, truck or oil rig; 4  a station in Antarctica; 5  a room or lodging provided for shift workers such as fire-fighters, ambulance staff and caregivers when they are periodically required to sleep at their workplace and the accommodation is provided only for the duration of the performance of the duties; 6  accommodation provided at remote locations outside New Zealand where an employee is expected to “fly in and fly out” such as mines in Australia; 7 and  temporary accommodation provided to manage outbreak or spread of COVID- 19. 8 12. Flowchart 1 assists in determining whether the employer has provided accommodation that is excluded: 4 Section CE 1(2)(b)(i). 5 Section CE 1(2)(b)(iii). 6 Section CE 1(2)(b)(iii). 7 Section CE 1(2)(b)(iv). 8 Section CE 1(4) and the Income Tax (Employment Income—Meaning of Accommodation) Regulations 2021. OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Flowchart 1: Determining whether the employer has provided accommodation that is excluded Start What type of board or lodging has the employer provided the employee? ...a berth, room or other lodging provided on a mobile workplace (such as a ship, truck or oil rig)? ...a station in Antarctica? No ...a room or lodging that is provided for a shift worker who is required periodically to sleep at their workplace when the accommodation is provided only for the duration of the performance of those duties(such as for on duty fire-fighters, ambulance staff or caregivers)? ... the use of a room or other dwelling provided at a remote location outside New Zealand when a person’s employment duties require them to work at the location for a period and also requir e them to be absent from the location for a period (such as fly in fly out miners)? ...temporary accommodation provided to manage outbreak or spread of COVID-19. Refer to whether the exemptions apply The employee has not derived income under s CE 1(1)(bb) No No No No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Even if what is provided is accommodation, do any of the exemptions apply? 13. Certain types of employer-provided accommodation, which are included in the definition of “accommodation”, may still be exempt from tax. These exemptions fall into three broad categories:  out-of-town secondments and projects (discussed from \[15\]) ; 9  ongoing multiple workplaces (discussed from \[39\]) ; 10  conferences and overnight stays (discussed from \[43\]) . 11 14. It is important to note that none of these exemptions will apply if employer-provided- accommodation is provided under an explicit salary trade-off arrangement (that is, if the employee opts to receive a lower salary than what they are otherwise entitled to in exchange for accommodation provided by the employer). 12 Accommodation provided under such an arrangement will be taxable income to the employee. Employee accommodation – out-of-town secondments and projects (section CW 16B) 15. When an employee needs to work at a new work location that is not within reasonable daily travelling distance of their residence, employer-provided accommodation will be exempt from tax if:  there is a reasonable expectation that the employee’s secondment to that work location will be for a period of two years or less, in which case the payment will be exempt for up to two years (discussed from \[19\]); or  the employee’s move is to work on a project of limited duration the principal purpose of which is the creation, enhancement or demolition of a capital asset and the employee’s involvement in that project is expected to be for three years or less; in which case, the payment will be exempt for up to three years (discussed from \[22\]); or 9 Section CW 16B. 10 Section CW 16F. 11 Section CW 16D. 12 Section CW 16B(2). OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  the move is to work on Canterbury earthquake recovery projects; however, due to the passage of time since the Canterbury 2011 earthquake, this exception is now of limited application. Definitions – residence and reasonable daily travelling distance 16. For any of the exemptions to apply, the employee must travel from their residence to a workplace and the workplace must be outside the reasonable daily travelling distance. 17. “Residence” is not defined in the Act, but the Commissioner considers that “residence” refers to the employee’s home immediately before the change in location and the distance test is assessed with reference to that residence and the travelling distance between that residence and the work location. 18. The Commissioner’s position on what she considers to be “reasonable daily travelling distance” was published in “Guidance on a ‘reasonable daily travelling distance’ ”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 9 (December 2009): 6. This guidance is also applicable to the accommodation exemptions. Reasonable expectation that the secondment will be for two years or less 19. Where a reasonable expectation exists that the employee’s secondment to a workplace that is not within a reasonable daily travelling distance will be for a period of two years or less, the accommodation will generally be exempt from tax for the length of the secondment. This is illustrated in Example 2 below. 20. Reasonable expectation is considered at the time the secondment is entered into - how long each party expected the secondment to last when it started. Things that may be taken into account in terms of forming that expectation include the employee’s terms of employment or whether the expectation is captured in a written employment agreement or in some other way (for example, by way of communication between the parties). This is illustrated in Example 2. 21. The expectation could also be captured in other documents such as board minutes, planning documents, and correspondence with the third party for whom the employer is carrying out the project. Example 2 Tahi lives in Auckland and is seconded to a job in Wellington for 12 months. Tahi’s employer agrees to meet her costs of living in Wellington. There is no OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] formal secondment agreement between the parties, but correspondence and other documentation clearly demonstrate how long the parties expect the secondment to be. As the secondment is for two years or less (in this case, 12 months) any employer-provided accommodation at the distant location is not taxable. Example 3 Liam lives and works in Auckland. He is an accountant who has worked for his employer for 10 years. The employer sends Liam to New Plymouth for three months to audit a large client. Liam pays for his stay in a hotel in New Plymouth, and his employer fully reimburses him for this cost. As Liam’s employer expects him to work in New Plymouth for a period two years or less, the payment that Liam receives as reimbursement for his accommodation costs in New Plymouth is not taxable. Accommodation linked to long-term projects of limited duration 22. When an employee is required to work at a distant workplace in relation to a long- term project of limited duration, employer-provided accommodation can be exempt where a reasonable expectation exists that the employee will be working at a distant workplace on that project for a period of three years or less. 23. This period takes into account certain business practices, particularly in the construction industry. For example, employees might be housed at or near a construction site, might share accommodation, or might be employed on a “fly in, fly out” basis, so would not be relocating. Employees may be recruited from overseas with no intention that they ever relocate permanently to New Zealand. 24. Projects covered by this exemption are not limited to the construction industry, but may involve, for example, upgrades of existing infrastructure or information technology development and implementation. 25. The three-year period is the time the employee is involved in the project, not the length of the project itself (which may be longer). The reasonable expectation needs to exist when the employee commences work on the project. 26. The project must satisfy the following requirements: OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  The project’s main aim must be the creation of a capital asset, whether a new asset, a replacement of an existing asset, an upgrade, or refurbishment;  The employee must be engaged exclusively on project work (bar incidental activities); and  The project must involve work for a client that is not associated with the employer (the associated party rules in sections YB 1 to YB 16 apply). Example 4 Helio is seconded by his employer to oversee project management on the initial stages of a dam construction project carried out by a client in a remote area of the North Island. Because of the scale of the project, the number of workers and the remoteness of the location, Helio’s employer sets up an accommodation facility to house its employees working on the project, including Helio. The entire project is expected to take around seven years to complete, however Helio is only involved in the preliminary work. Both Helio and his employer expect Helio to work on the project for the first two and a half years. Helio is working on a project involving the construction of a capital asset. Both he and his employer expect him to be working at the distant work location for three years or less. Therefore, the value of the accommodation provided to Helio is exempt. Exemption for out-of -town secondments and long-term projects can cease to apply if circumstances change 27. Even if the employer-provided accommodation meets the requirements to be considered exempt, the accommodation can cease to be exempt if circumstances change. The accommodation will cease to be exempt if:  the employer pays part of or all the costs associated with buying the employee a house in or near the new work location;  the employee’s involvement in the secondment or project comes to an end; or  the expectation that the employee will only be at the new location for a maximum of two years or three years (whichever applies) changes so that the employee is reasonably expected that they will be at the distant workplace for longer. OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 28. From the point in time that the circumstances change as outlined above, any employer-provided accommodation will be taxable, but accommodation provided before that time will remain exempt. This is illustrated in Example 5: Example 5 Fatima works for an employer in Auckland. Her employer sends her to work in Hamilton for an expected 18-month period. After four months, Fatima decides she wants to relocate permanently to Hamilton. Her employer agrees to make the job in Hamilton permanent and to pay Fatima an accommodation allowance for the first six months after her arrival in Hamilton. For the first four months, the employer reasonably expected that Fatima would not be working in Hamilton for more than two years. Therefore, the payments to cover Fatima’s accommodation for those first four months are exempt under the two-year rule. But now that Fatima is expected to be working in Hamilton for more than two years, any payments to cover her accommodation after the initial four months are taxable. Expected period initially exceeds the time limit but subsequently reduces 29. If a secondment is initially expected to exceed the relevant two or three-year period, it will be subject to tax. 30. However, if this expectation changes and the total period will be less than the relevant time limit (two or three years as relevant), the employer-provided accommodation becomes exempt from the date the expectation changes. The employer-provided accommodation up to the date the expectation changes remains taxable – there is no retrospective exemption following the change in expectation. This is illustrated in Example 6. OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 13 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 6 Raj lives in Napier. His employer sends him to Tauranga to set up and manage a new office. The initial expectation is that Raj will be in Tauranga for four years. Raj’s employer provides him with accommodation in Tauranga. As the secondment is expected to be more than two years the accommodation will be taxable. One year into the secondment, Raj’s employer decides Raj only needs to stay in Tauranga for another six months as the company has found someone based locally to run the office on a permanent basis. As the expectation of the total secondment duration is now less than two years (18 months), the final six months of the accommodation provided to Raj are exempt from tax. The accommodation provided for the first 12 months, before the change in expectation, remains taxable. New employees and out-of -town secondments and long-term projects 31. The exemptions described above for employer-provided accommodation generally apply in relation to existing employees. However, they can apply to new employees in specific instances. 32. New employees only qualify for the two-year exemption for secondments when:  the employee is newly recruited to work at a particular work location but is then temporarily sent to work at another work location (f or example, an individual is recruited to work in Auckland but before starting in Auckland is sent to work in Dunedin for a month before returning to Auckland); or  an employee working for one employer is seconded to work for another employer on a temporary basis, with the expectation that the employee will return to work for the original employer (f or example, an individual working for an Australian accountancy firm is sent to work for an affiliated New Zealand firm in Auckland for 18 months). 33. New employees qualify for the three-year exemption for work on a project of limited duration subject to the same conditions as existing employees. OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 14 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Exceptional circumstances – extended exemption period 34. In exceptional circumstances, employer-provided accommodation can continue to be treated as exempt even though the employee continues to work at the distant workplace for longer than the two or three-year period in the exemption. 35. “Exceptional circumstances” are confined to those that are outside the control of the employer and employee, such as a natural disaster or medical emergency, with the result that the employee must stay at the work location. The employer-provided accommodation can continue to be treated as exempt for as long as the exceptional circumstance means the employee is unable to leave the work location. Restarting the time period 36. For the purpose of determining whether a time limit for the exemption for secondments or projects applies, a break in a period of continuous work at a distant workplace may result in a restart of the time period. However, the break will be ignored if a reason that is more than incidental for the cessation of the employment or service at that location is to allow a further period of exemption. 13 Relationship with the relocation payments rule 37. If an employee is not eligible for the above out-of-town secondments and projects exemption, they may still qualify for the accommodation exemption for up to three months after their arrival, under section CW 17B (tax-exempt relocation payments). 38. For a list of relocation expenses that are eligible under section CW 17B, see Determination Det 09/04 – Eligible relocation expenses (Inland Revenue, 2009). Relocation expenses include such things as the cost of removal and transport of household effects. Employer-provided accommodation – ongoing multiple workplaces Multiple workplace exemption 39. An employee may be required to work at more than one workplace on an ongoing basis. When this occurs, employer-provided accommodation that they receive in relation to working at a distant workplace (one outside a reasonable daily travelling 13 Section CW16C(6). OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 15 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] distance) is exempt from tax, without an upper time limit. 14 This is illustrated in Example 7. 40. The multiple workplace rule can also apply when an employee is sent on a short-term business trip to another location. This is illustrated in Example 8. 41. In these circumstances, the employee will continue to have ongoing duties at their usual place of work while they are working at the distant work location during the business trip. Example 7 Lucia manages two offices, one in Christchurch and one in Dunedin. She works in Christchurch two days a week and in Dunedin for three days a week. Her home is in Dunedin. Lucia has more than one ongoing work location. When she works in Christchurch, she is beyond reasonable daily travelling distance from her home in Dunedin. An accommodation payment to cover her hotel costs when staying in Christchurch is exempt under the multiple workplace rule. Therefore, the Christchurch accommodation is not taxable. Example 8 Carmen is chief executive of a large group of companies based in Auckland. The group has offices in several cities across New Zealand. Each month Carmen visits one of these offices as part of her management duties. Typically, these visits last up to a week, and Carmen’s employer arranges and pays for her accommodation at a nearby hotel. When Carmen is visiting the offices away from Auckland, she has more than one ongoing workplace for the duration of her visit. Therefore, the cost of her accommodation while working at those offices is exempt under the multiple workplace rule. 14 See section CW 16F. OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 16 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Multiple workplace exemption does not apply to a home office 42. The multiple workplace exemption does not apply when the employee has two workplaces and one of those workplaces is a home office. 15 Any accommodation provided to such an employee by their employer is taxable. Employee-provided accommodation – meetings, conferences and training courses 43. When an employee needs to attend a work-related meeting, conference or training course that requires at least an overnight stay, any employer-provided accommodation is exempt from tax without an upper time limit. 16 44. While the need for accommodation would usually arise because the work-related meeting, conference or training course is beyond reasonable daily travelling distance from the employee’s home, this need not be the case. Some courses may be held locally but may require employees to stay overnight for reasons such as networking and team building. 45. This exemption covers both local and distant accommodation situations. The definition of “period of continuous work” includes a period that the employee is required to stay in a location that is not distant from the employee’s regular workplace. 17 46. If a stopover is required in travelling to or from the location, accommodation at that stopover is also exempt. 47. Flowchart 2 summarises the above and assists in determining whether accommodation is exempt: 15 Section CW 16F. 16 Section CW 16D. 17 Section CW 16D(4). OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 17 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Flowchart 2: Determining whether the accommodation is exempt OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 18 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Part 2: What is the value of the accommodation subject to tax? 48. If accommodation is taxable, the next step is to determine the value (often referred to as the taxable value). What are the general valuation rules? Value where the employer physically provides employee accommodation 49. Where an employer physically provides employee accommodation the value of that accommodation is the market rental value. 50. The Commissioner broadly considers that market rental value refers to the amount that would be arrived at by two non-associated parties, on an arm’s length basis, for the rental of the accommodation. 51. For guidance on estimating the likely market rental value of employer-provided accommodation, see Commissioner’s Statement CS 16/02 : Determining “market rental value” of employer-provided accommodation (Inland Revenue, 2016), and with reference to employees of boarding schools: Commissioner’s Statement CS 18/01: Determining "market rental value" of employer-provided accommodation - Boarding Schools (Inland Revenue, 2018). Value for accommodation allowance or payment of accommodation expenditure 52. Where an accommodation allowance or accommodation expenditure is paid by the employer (whether directly or by reimbursement to the employee), the market value is the amount paid. This amount may be varied by the adjustments discussed from \[54\]. 53. Some providers of accommodation services (such as hotels, managed apartments, and short stay accommodation providers) offer accommodation to their clients in addition to other services that do not fall within the definition of accommodation under the Income Tax Act 2007. These additional services may include, for example, wireless internet access. The cost of these additional services are sometimes, but not always, itemised separately from the accommodation provided when the recipient is billed. Where the cost of these additional services are not separated out from the cost of the OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 19 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] accommodation provided by the service provider, the Commissioner takes a pragmatic approach and would treat the benefit received from these additional services as part of the accommodation received. 18 Adjustments to the taxable amount 54. Once the market value has been determined, several factors may result in adjustments being made before the taxable amount is determined:  Rent paid by the employee: If an employee pays rent on the accommodation provided, the amount of rent paid should be subtracted from the market value to determine the taxable value. (See \[55\].)  Business or work use: Where a portion of the premises is used for work by the employee (for the employer that provides the accommodation), a pro-rated adjustment may be made to reflect that. The taxable value will be the portion of the premises used by the employee for accommodation only. (See from \[56\].)  Shared accommodation: An adjustment is allowed when two or more employees share accommodation. (See from \[58\].)  Overseas accommodation: The taxable value of employer-funded accommodation provided to employees as part of an overseas posting is capped at the average or median rental value for accommodation in the vicinity where the employee would have lived if in New Zealand. 19 This cap, which is of significance to employees who remain tax resident in New Zealand, recognises that the market rental value of accommodation in overseas locations can be disproportionately high compared with the value of accommodation that an employee might occupy if working in New Zealand (see from \[60\]).  Ministers of religion: A specific valuation rule applies to accommodation supplied by religious bodies to their ministers (see from \[67\]). 20 18 For clarity – where the costs of non-accommodation services are itemised separately from the cost of accommodation provided, the tax treatment of the non-accommodation services must be considered on their own facts. 19 Section CE 1C. 20 Section CE 1E. Section CE 1D also provides rules for calculating the market value of accommodation where accommodation is physically provided by the New Zealand Defence Force, but this will not be covered in any detail in this Statement. OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 20 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Rent paid by the employee 55. The taxable value should be reduced by the amount of any rent that the employee pays for that accommodation. This is illustrated in Example 9. Example 9 As part of Michael’s salary package, his employer agrees to pay his accommodation costs in Auckland up to a value of $500 per week. Michael finds an apartment that he likes, but the weekly rent is $700 per week. His employer agrees to pay the rent to that value, on the basis that Michael pays the $200 difference to his employer. The taxable value of the accommodation that Michael receives in this example is $500 per week, as the $200 per week rent that he pays to his employer is deducted from the taxable value of the accommodation received. Work use of accommodation 56. If part of the accommodation provided is used for work purposes, the taxable value is accordingly reduced on a pro-rata basis. To qualify, a clearly identifiable part of the accommodation needs to be used “wholly or mainly” for work purposes related to the employee’s employment (with the employer providing the accommodation). That portion of the premises does not need to be used solely for work purposes to meet the “wholly or mainly” test, but it must at least be used predominantly for work purposes and its primary purpose must be work related. 57. The deduction is determined by apportioning between the business and private use of the accommodation. This is illustrated in Example 10. Any non-work-related use will be ignored, if it is temporary, sporadic or otherwise minor (such as using an office for checking personal emails or a family member occasionally using it for personal projects). OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 21 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 10 Miha works as a dental assistant. Her employer provides her with accommodation that has a market rental of $500 a week. Miha has set up one bedroom in the property as a workspace to make dental impressions. It is usually used as a workspace, but it also has a sofa bed. On occasion, when Miha has house guests, the sofa bed is used as a bed for the guest to sleep. The use of the space as an occasional sleeping area for guests is ignored as it is temporary and sporadic – it is wholly or mainly used as a workspace. As the workspace is one-tenth of the total floor area of the accommodation, $50 is deducted from the rent paid, with the result that the taxable value is $450 per week. Shared accommodation – apportionment of taxable value 58. Generally, when two or more employees share accommodation provided by their employer, the taxable amount is still the market rental value - the issue is only one of apportionment between the employees. 59. The amount may be apportioned equally between the employees or, if the employer and employees agree, apportioned between the employees on a different basis (for example, based on bedroom size). This is illustrated in Example 11. Example 11 George and Tana work for a start-up in Wellington. Their employer rents a $400 per week two-bedroom property for them to live in. Tana manages to pick his bedroom first and chooses the bigger of the two rooms. The market rental value of the property is $400 per week. As Tana has a bigger room than George, they agree with their employer that the value of the accommodation will be split on a 60:40 basis – the taxable value of the accommodation received by Tana will therefore be $240 per week, and by George will be $160 per week. OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 22 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Accommodation provided to employees working overseas – exception to the general rules 60. An exception to the general valuation rules is for accommodation provided to employees working overseas. This exception allows the use of a New Zealand– equivalent-based value for the market value rather than the market value of the actual overseas accommodation provided. 21 61. In establishing the value of an equivalent New Zealand property, it is necessary to consider where the employee would likely be working for the employer at the overseas location, the equivalent accommodation the person would likely occupy if living in New Zealand, and the average or median market rental values at or near that equivalent work area. 62. What is received overseas is only relevant if the rental value of the overseas accommodation is less than the average or median market rent of the equivalent New Zealand accommodation. In those circumstances, the value used for tax purposes is the rental value of the overseas accommodation. This is illustrated in Example 12. Example 12 Zoe is seconded by her employer to work at its site in Brussels for three years and is provided with a flat for the duration of her secondment. The rent the employer pays is equivalent to $50,000 a year. Zoe would work in central Wellington if working in New Zealand and would be likely to be living in a two-bedroom apartment with her partner in central Wellington where an average annual rental value would be $24,000. The market value of the accommodation Zoe receives is therefore the cost of the accommodation that she would have had in Wellington, not the value of the equivalent accommodation in Brussels. As a result she is taxed on an accommodation value of $24,000 per year. 63. In establishing the comparable New Zealand property, a relevant factor is the number of family members in the employee's household in the overseas location, their ages (adults and children) and their living requirements. 64. For example, if an employee has a household of four but goes on secondment overseas while their family remains behind, their New Zealand equivalent 21 The New Zealand equivalent value can also be used for determining the taxable value of an allowance or amount paid for or towards the provision of the accommodation. OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 23 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] accommodation will be determined based on what accommodation they would be likely to occupy as a person living alone. Equally, if their spouse joined them but not their children, the equivalent accommodation would be the accommodation that they would be likely to occupy as a couple rather than as a family of four. This is illustrated in Example 13. Example 13 Jo is seconded by her employer to Jakarta for three years and is provided with an apartment in central Jakarta for the duration of her secondment. The rent her employer pays is equivalent to $25,000 a year. Jo would normally work in central Wellington if working in New Zealand and live in a five-bedroom house in Tawa with her adult children. Jo’s children are settled at university and value their independence, so as a family they decide that Jo will go to Jakarta by herself, while her adult children will remain behind and maintain the house in Tawa. Therefore, Jo only needs a small apartment in Jakarta as she will be the only occupant. As a result, the market value of the accommodation Jo receives is the equivalent of a small apartment close to central Wellington. The cost of the equivalent apartment in Wellington would cost $35,000 a year. As this value is more than the value of the accommodation she is receiving in Jakarta, the taxable amount is the value of the Jakarta accommodation – $25,000 per year. 65. If the employee’s role in New Zealand can be performed in more than one location in New Zealand, an average of the multiple locations can be used to determine the New Zealand equivalent accommodation. If the employee’s role in New Zealand can be performed anywhere in New Zealand, a New Zealand wide valuation can be used. Either the average or the median market rental value for the whole of New Zealand can be used. This is illustrated in Example 14. OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 24 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 14 Anahera works as a software developer for a company based in Auckland and Wellington. Four months ago, her employer agreed for her to move from Wellington to Katikati to trial working remotely. Following a successful trial, her employer agrees that Anahera’s position can be performed from anywhere in New Zealand. Anahera then secures a two-year secondment to work for the company’s new office in Reykjavik, Iceland. Due to differences in time zones, this work requires her to be permanently based in Reykjavik. As part of her secondment, Anahera receives accommodation for her and her two children, who will join her in Reykjavik, to the value of $50,000 per year. To calculate the New Zealand equivalent, the average cost of accommodation in New Zealand as a whole is used, because Anahera’s role in New Zealand can be performed anywhere in New Zealand. This would be approximately $26,000 per year for Anahera and her two children. This is less than the amount she receives from her employer for accommodation in Reykjavik. As a result, the amount that the equivalent accommodation would cost her in New Zealand ($26,000 per year) is the taxable value of the accommodation. 66. There are a range of sources available to help determine average or median market rental values. For example, the Tenancy Services website, which provides market rental statistics: https://www.tenancy.govt.nz/rent-bond-and-bills/ . Accommodation provided by religious bodies to ministers of religion 67. The value of accommodation supplied to ministers of religion is determined under section CE 1E. 22 A long-standing administrative practice had previously capped the value of church-supplied accommodation at 10% of a minister’s stipend. This practice was incorporated into the legislation with effect from 1 April 2015. 68. A “minister of religion” is defined in the Act as a person:  who is ordained, commissioned, appointed, or otherwise holds an office or position, regardless of their title or designation, as a minister of a religious 22 This specific valuation rule only applies to accommodation physically provided by the church. In all cases (for example, an accommodation allowances or reimbursement) the general valuation rules apply. OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 25 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] denomination or community that meets the charitable purpose of the advancement of religion;  whose duties are related mainly to the practice, study, teaching, or advancement of religious beliefs; and  whose accommodation is used as an integral part of performing their duties. 69. The requirement that a minister’s church-provided accommodation is used as an integral part of performing the minister’s duties will be met as long as there is an expectation underlying a minister’s pastoral duties that some church members might visit their home, irrespective of whether any visits happen in practice. Therefore, ministers do not need to record whether visits happen to satisfy this requirement. 70. The amount of income arising to a minister from accommodation provided to them is calculated using the following formula: 23 remuneration × (1 – adjustment) + excess rental Where: remuneration is 10% of the remuneration that the minister receives from the religious society or organisation for the income year for the performance of their duties as a minister adjustment is the value of the accommodation that is apportioned to work-related use, expressed as a decimal fraction of the total value of the accommodation. To be eligible for apportionment, the minister needs to use the relevant part of the accommodation wholly or mainly for work purposes. For example, if the minister uses 10% of the accommodation wholly or mainly for work purposes, the value of the adjustment would be (1 - 0.1) = 0.9. If more than one minister of religion lives in the accommodation, the adjustment is apportioned equally between them excess rental is the difference between the received accommodation’s market rental value and the market rental value of accommodation that is reasonably commensurate with the duties of the person as a minister and for the location in which they perform their duties. The amount of excess rental cannot be less than zero for the purpose of the calculation. This is illustrated in Example 15. 71. However, no adjustment is allowed simply because ministers of religion share accommodation. The value of the employer-provided accommodation is calculated 23 Section CE 1E(2). OS 21/01 | 10 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 26 of 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] with reference to the employee (or employees) who receives the accommodation as part of their work. 72. If the accommodation is provided for only part of the year, the calculations of the value are with reference to that part of the year. Example 15 Anareia is an ordained parish priest for the Anglican Church. She serves her parish in the East Cape region. Along with of her stipend of $60,000 per year, the church provides her with accommodation in a three-bedroom house in Ruatoria. Anareia uses one large bedroom as an office to meet with visiting parishioners. The value of the room (based on floor area) is about 15 percent of the total value of the property. The value of the accommodation provided to Anareia is $16,000 per year. This is commensurate with her duties as minister and for the location where she is based. As a result, the “excess rental” for the purposes of calculating the value of the accommodation received is nil. The value of her accommodation received is therefore: $6,000 (being 10% of her annual stipend) x (1-0.15) + 0 = $5,100. 73. This exemption does not apply to an accommodation allowance or reimbursement received by a minister of religion. The ordinary rules for calculating the value of an accommodation allowance or reimbursement apply. 74. It is important to note that the definition of “minister of religion” specifically excludes a member of a religious society or order referred to in section CW 25. Section CW 25 provides for an exemption for board and lodging provided to members of religious societies and orders whose sole occupation is service in a society or order and who are not paid for their service. This exclusion does not apply to a minister of religion who receives a stipend (and is therefore paid) for their service. Tony Munt National Advisor, Technical Standards Date of issue: 10 June 2021
UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Administration of the imported mismatch rule – section FH 11 Issued: 30 June 2021 OS 21/02 Operational statements set out the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s view of the law in respect of the matter discussed and deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Statement is intended to clarify the Commissioner’s expectations as to how taxpayers will meet their self-assessment obligations when applying the imported hybrid mismatch rule in s FH 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to payments to members of their control group, and how the rule will be administered by Inland Revenue in relation to such payments. All legislative references in this Statement are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise specified. OS 21/02 | 30 June 2020 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Introduction 1. The imported mismatch rule in s FH 11 is one of the hybrid mismatch rules introduced as subpart FH with effect for income years beginning on and after 1 July 2018. S ection FH 11 is discussed in detail in Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 31, No. 3 (April 2019) from page 74. 2. The purpose of the imported mismatch rule is to deny a deduction for a payment by a New Zealand taxpayer to the extent that that payment funds, directly or indirectly, a hybrid mismatch occurring entirely outside New Zealand, if certain requirements are met. This Statement sets out the Commissioner’s approach to administering the imported mismatch rule. 3. This Statement is not intended to provide a safe harbour. Compliance with the Statement does not guarantee that there will be no deductions disallowed under s FH 11. However, compliance with the Statement will reduce the likelihood of lack of reasonable care penalties being imposed where an imported mismatch is later found to exist. Summary of approach 4. Where a taxpayer makes a deductible payment to a person who is resident in a country that does not have hybrid mismatch rules corresponding to those in subpart FH, they are expected to take certain steps in order to ensure compliance with the imported mismatch rule contained in the section. 5. This Statement deals with payments that are made to a person who is in the same group as the taxpayer. Where the steps required by the Commissioner, as explained in \[13\] are taken a taxpayer will have complied with their self-assessment obligations under s FH 11. 6. Where the appropriate steps are not taken the Commissioner may require evidence of the taxpayer’s compliance with s FH 11. Where evidence is not provided in a timely manner, this may result in a denial of the relevant deductions in New Zealand, and in the taxpayer being unable to present such evidence subsequently in a dispute. OS 21/02 | 30 June 2020 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Application of the statement 7. This Operational Statement applies to all arrangements referred to in s FH 11 and applies from the 2021 income year. Discussion Criteria 8. The criteria for the application of s FH 11 are as follows: 1. A New Zealand resident taxpayer or a New Zealand deducting branch (funder) makes a payment in an income year, 2. To a person in a country outside New Zealand that is not subject to hybrid rules equivalent to those in New Zealand in relation to that payment, 3. The funder is allowed a deduction in New Zealand for the payment, 4. The payment provides funds, directly or indirectly, for a payment (funded payment) by a person outside New Zealand (payer) to another person (payee), and 5. The funded payment gives rise to a hybrid mismatch that is not counteracted by hybrid mismatch rules. 9. The imported mismatch rule applies to payments to third parties (but only if there is a structured arrangement) and payments to control group members (whether or not the arrangement is a structured arrangement). The rule applies to structured arrangements in income years commencing on or after 1 July 2018 and non-structured arrangements in income years commencing on or after 1 January 2020. 10. Compliance with the imported mismatch rule requires New Zealand resident taxpayers and New Zealand deducting branches to have knowledge of the tax treatment of payments that are made entirely outside of New Zealand. This requires them to obtain information from persons outside New Zealand. 11. The following is an outline of the approach that the Commissioner expects taxpayers to take to ensure they are complying with the imported mismatch rule in relation to payments to control group members. If this approach is not taken, taxpayers risk having deductions denied. OS 21/02 | 30 June 2020 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Determining whether adjustments required 12. In accordance with s FH 11, if a New Zealand taxpayer funds a hybrid mismatch that occurs outside New Zealand an adjustment denying a deduction for some or all of the payments made by the New Zealand taxpayer is required to reflect the amount of the hybrid mismatch that has been funded by the payment from New Zealand. This will require the New Zealand taxpayer to have access to information relating to the offshore tax treatment of payments made outside New Zealand. Particularly in the case of a group whose headquarters are outside New Zealand, New Zealand’s tax reporting will be relying on people outside of New Zealand being able to provide information on whether or not hybrid mismatches exist. These hybrid mismatches can occur, directly or indirectly, as part of structured transactions or unstructured transactions within control groups. 13. To comply with their self-assessment obligations under s FH 11 in respect of payments to control group members, the Commissioner expects that New Zealand taxpayers will: 1. Identify payments made to non-resident control group members that are tax deductible before applying the imported mismatch rule, 2. Determine whether any such payments are to a person that is in a jurisdiction that has not implemented hybrid mismatch rules equivalent to New Zealand’s, and 3. If the answer to 2 is yes, before claiming a deduction ensure that the group head office tax function has undertaken appropriate work to: • identify any hybrid mismatches within the group; and • determine the extent to which these are funded by otherwise deductible payments from New Zealand payers. 14. If the taxpayer is part of a group headquartered in: • New Zealand, the work referred to in step 3 will generally be taken by group employees in New Zealand, or at their direction • another country, the work referred to in step 3 may well be undertaken by group employees outside New Zealand. In that case, the Commissioner expects that the taxpayer will obtain from the group’s head office tax function a written statement regarding that work. 15. For tax years beginning before 1 January 2020, in which only the structured imported mismatch applies, enquiries by the group head office tax function may be limited to OS 21/02 | 30 June 2020 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] those necessary to determine whether there is or are, in relation to all transactions that are part of a structured arrangement involving the otherwise deductible payment by the New Zealand taxpayer, pricing or other facts or circumstances which mean that a member of the control group could reasonably be aware of the existence of the hybrid mismatch. For later tax years, this limitation does not apply. 16. In the case of a group that is not headquartered in New Zealand, if the steps taken by the group’s head office tax function and communicated to the New Zealand taxpayer can reasonably be expected to accurately determine the extent, if any, of the application of the imported hybrid mismatch rule, and the taxpayer has no reason to believe that the determination is not correct, then the taxpayer has complied with its self-assessment obligations with respect to the rule. 17. There is no prescribed form for such a statement, but an example is provided below of the type of statement the Commissioner would expect to be provided, addressed from the Group Head of Tax to the relevant New Zealand personnel: “I have ensured that suitably qualified personnel within the group have reviewed the tax treatment of all deductible cross-border payments by members of the group to determine whether they give rise to a hybrid mismatch. As a result of this review I can advise that \[if no hybrid mismatches funded by New Zealand\] \[New Zealand subsidiary/deducting branch\] payments have not funded directly or indirectly any such mismatches; \[Or, if there are hybrid mismatches funded by New Zealand\] \[New Zealand subsidiary/deducting branch\] payments totalling $\[. \] have funded directly or indirectly such mismatches; In undertaking this review and making this determination, the principles set out in the OECD Final Report on hybrid mismatches and/or section FH 11 of the New Zealand Income Tax Act 2007 have been considered and complied with.” No Evidence Obtained 18. Where a New Zealand taxpayer has: • Claimed a deduction for payments to non-resident control group members in countries without hybrid rules corresponding to subpart FH, and OS 21/02 | 30 June 2020 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • In the case of a taxpayer that is a member of a foreign headquartered group, received no statement from its group head office tax function as set out above, • In the case of a taxpayer that is a member of a New Zealand headquartered group, does not have evidence that the possible application of section FH 11 has been appropriately considered and analysed. then the Commissioner may request from the New Zealand taxpayer, under s 17B of the Tax Administration Act (TAA), such a statement, or other evidence that the imported hybrid mismatch rule has been considered. 19.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Excusing estates from filing income tax returns Issued: 24 August 2021 OS 21/03 Operational Statements set out the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s view of the law in respect of the matter discussed and deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Statement sets out a change in the Commissioner’s approach to applying the income tax return filing exemption in s 43B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to estates. All legislative references in this Statement are to the Tax Administration Act 1994, unless otherwise specified. This Statement applies from the date of issue. Introduction Section 43B allows trustees of non-active trusts to be excused from the obligation to file income tax returns if the trusts meet certain requirements. With some exceptions, the Commissioner's general approach has been that s 43B only applies to non-active trusts. It does not apply to deceased estates that similarly derive no income. This is on the basis that “estates” are something different to “trusts”. The Commissioner has now modified her position to accept that there can be occasions during the administration of an estate where the estate property is held on trust and the s 43B exemption can apply. OS 21/03 | 24 August 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] This Statement sets out the broad approach that the Commissioner is taking to determining whether an estate’s administration has got to that point. The requirement to file income tax returns 1. For income derived by a deceased person until the date of death, executors and administrators must meet whatever filing and income tax obligations the deceased would have had if they had remained alive (s 43). If the deceased only had “reportable income” (types of income where tax has been withheld at source by the payer, such as employment and investment income), these obligations can be met through the pre- populated account process in subpart 3B (“auto-calc”). 2. Executors and administrators must also obtain a separate IRD number for the estate and make returns for income derived in the years following death. 3. The prescribed return form to be used for income derived after death is the same income tax return as prescribed for trustees (the IR 6 return). However, this is for administrative convenience rather than because an estate is a trust. Being excused from filing a return under s 43B 4. Under s 43B, a “trustee of a trust” can apply to be excused from the obligation to file income tax returns if they meet the specified requirements. These requirements concern being a “complying trust” as described in s HC 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007, making a declaration to the Commissioner as to various matters (the IR 633 form has been prescribed for this - more information can be obtained here ) and also not having any income or deductible expenditure for the year, ie they are “non-active”. 5. The reference to “trustee of a trust” means that any exemption from filing is limited to situations where there is a “trust”. 6. While “trustee” is a defined term and can include an executor or administrator, “trust” is not a defined term in tax legislation and has the meaning it has in general law. That meaning is broad. However, a trust does not automatically arise in the administration of every estate. In general law, the position is that executors hold the property in the estate “in right of the deceased” and not in trust. A trust can, and often does, arise before an estate is fully administered but administration of the estate needs to have reached the stage of the property being held by someone with the special duties of a trustee. OS 21/03 | 24 August 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 7. Therefore, at some point in the administration of an estate a trust can arise, and that trust may qualify under s 43B. However, this does raise the question of how to determine when administration of an estate has got to the point that property that until then was part of the estate is now held on a trust. When will a trust arise in the administration of a deceased estate? 8. Executors and administrators of estates have duties to collect the deceased’s property and to use it to meet any expenses, debts and legacies and to distribute what is left according to the directions in a will or the law of intestacy. A trust will only arise when executors and administrators have completed their duties to the point that they stand ready to “distribute” the remaining property (in technical terms, this is referred to as “assent”). The fact the estate administration has reached this point can be evidenced in various ways, depending on the particular circumstances. For example, it might be explicit in or able to be inferred from a letter to a trust beneficiary from an executor. Or it might be clear from their actions. 9. Interpretation Statement IS 18/01 Taxation of trusts has further discussion (from \[9.25\]) on taxation in the context of deceased estates. 10. At the time of assent, the distribution may be to separate trustees specified in a will (so it will usually be straightforward to identify that a trust has arisen). However, it is common for a will to specify that the executors are also to be the trustees so there is a distribution only in the sense that the executors cease to hold the property in their capacity as executors and begin holding the property in a separate capacity as trustees. 11. A trust provided for in a will is known as a testamentary trust. Testamentary trusts are general law trusts. It follows that a testamentary trust, once it arises, is a “trust” for the purposes of s 43B. 12. Once administration of an estate by executors gets to the point that the assets in the estate are ready for distribution and are held by trustees of a testamentary trust for beneficiaries and the assets do not generate any income, s 43B may apply. The testamentary trust may be expressly provided for in the will or it may be implied. 13. A common situation is where the only significant property in the estate is a house, and a family member is granted a life interest or is otherwise allowed to live in the house until their death. 14. Where the family member is granted a life interest, and the executors have completed their administration duties to the point of being ready to distribute, the house may be OS 21/03 | 24 August 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] held on trust for the life tenant (and for the remainder beneficiaries - ie those who stand to inherit on the death of the life tenant). I n that case, because a trust has arisen for the life tenant, from the date of distribution of the property to the trustees the trustees can apply to be excused from filing under s 43B. 15. The situation differs where the family member is granted only a licence to reside in the property. I n that case another person will take the property subject to the licence under the will or intestacy. In some cases, the property subject to the licence may be distributed to a trustee to be held on trust for that other person (for example, where the other person is a minor). In that case s 43B may apply to the trust for the minor beneficiary if the licence allows the licensee to reside in the property for no consideration. The Commissioner’s approach 16. The Commissioner considers that executors and administrators are able to apply under s 43B to be excused from filing income tax returns where they have reached the point in administration of an estate that they are ready to distribute, or have distributed, the property in the estate to be held on trust for beneficiaries. 17. Executors and administrators who apply on this basis, or do so through their tax agent, will be excused if the trust in question meets the requirements of s 43B. They do not need to obtain a new IRD number for the trust, the number obtained earlier for the estate can be used. This Operational Statement is based on the Commissioner’s view of the law at the date of issue and applies until the statement is withdrawn, amended or any law change occurs. A legislative change to s 43B that may alter some or all the matters covered in this statement is currently being considered by the Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Unit of Inland Revenue. This Statement was signed on 24 August 2021. Rob Falk National Advisor, Legal Services Technical Standards

All legislative references in this Statement are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless specified otherwise. OS 21/04 | 01 December 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Introduction Operational statements set out the Commissioner’s view of the law in respect of the matter discussed and deal with the practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Statement discusses and provides guidance on the approach to take with regards to a non-resident employers’ obligations to deduct PAYE, FBT and ESCT in certain cross-border employment situations. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act) unless specified otherwise. Summary of approach 1. A non-resident employer has an obligation to withhold PAYE from a PAYE income payment made to an employee if:  The employer has made themselves subject to New Zealand tax law by having a sufficient presence in New Zealand; and  The services performed by the employee are properly attributable to the employer’s presence in New Zealand. 2. A non-resident employer may have a Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) or Employer Contribution Superannuation Tax (ESCT) liability for a benefit provided to, or a contribution made for an employee if:  The employer has made themselves subject to New Zealand tax law by having a sufficient presence in New Zealand; and  The services performed by the employee are properly attributable to the employer’s presence in New Zealand. 3. There is no PAYE withholding obligation if a PAYE income payment is “non-residents’ foreign sourced income” for the employee. OS 21/04 | 01 December 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4. There is also no PAYE withholding obligation for a PAYE income payment made to a non-resident employee working in New Zealand if the domestic exemption in s CW 19 applies, or a Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) gives relief from source taxation such as where the employee is in New Zealand 183 days or less in a twelve-month period. Application of the statement 5. This statement provides general guidance to assist non-resident employers’ in meeting their tax obligations regarding when to deduct PAYE, FBT and ESCT in cross-border situations. The Statement will apply from the date it is issued. However, the Commissioner will not be applying resources to examine positions taken by taxpayers prior to that date. 6. If you have any concerns about compliance with the tax obligations discussed in this st atement, you should discuss the matter with a tax professional or Inland Revenue. Discussion 7. This Statement provides guidance on whether employers have PAYE, FBT and ESCT obligations in various cross-border employment situations. 8. The different situations involve different combinations of; the residence of the employer, the residence of the employee, and the country in which the employment services are performed. Non-resident employers Territorial limitation - Presence 9. The PAYE rules 1 are intended to apply to New Zealand residents or matters over which New Zealand has jurisdiction. A non-resident may make themselves subject to New Zealand law (including the PAYE rules) by having a sufficient presence in New Zealand (Alcan 2 and Clark 3 ). The nature and extent of the required presence may vary 1 Section RD 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 2 Alcan New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,125 (HC). 3 Clark (Inspector of Taxes) v Oceanic Contractors Inc \[1983\] 1 All ER 133 (HL). OS 21/04 | 01 December 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] depending on the facts in each case. For example, a sufficient presence could range from a non-resident employer having a permanent office or site in New Zealand where trading operations are performed, or a non-resident employer having a single employee in New Zealand working from home and performing contracts in New Zealand on their behalf utilising labour and resources in New Zealand to perform that contract. 10. If a non-resident employer has a trading presence in New Zealand, such as carrying on operations and employing a workforce for the purpose of trade, this would normally be sufficient for the employer to have a PAYE withholding obligation for employees they pay PAYE income payments to. 11. A sufficient presence for a non-resident employer would also include having a permanent establishment, a branch, contracts that have been entered into in New Zealand and performing those contracts in New Zealand with employees based there for the purposes of carrying on trading operations as mentioned in \[10\]. An address for service (in New Zealand) may also indicate that the non-resident employer has made themselves subject to New Zealand law, even though this may be for reasons other than tax purposes. 12. A sufficient presence would not include a situation where an employee chooses (as a matter of personal preference) to undertake their employment activities in New Zealand where those activities have no necessary connection to New Zealand, and where this was the non-resident employers’ only connection with New Zealand. 13. It is considered that merely having employees in New Zealand would not, of itself, constitute a presence of the employer sufficient to subject the employer to New Zealand’s jurisdiction. Therefore, the degree to which an employee “represents” the employer in activities mentioned in \[9\], \[ 10\] and \[11\] will be one of the things to take into account to decide whether the presence is sufficient to mean that the employer has submitted themselves to New Zealand’s jurisdiction. 14. It is also considered that having a parent, subsidiary or associate would not be enough in itself to have a presence in New Zealand without something more, such as any of the factors mentioned in paragraphs \[9\], \[ 10\] and \[11\]. OS 21/04 | 01 December 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 1: Boston Architects (BA) is an architect firm bases in the USA. BA employs George who lives in Wellington. George participates in virtual meetings and completes all of his work in Wellington but as BA does not have any New Zealand clients, all the work is sent back to the US electronically. Would BA have an obligation to deduct PAYE? No. There would be no obligation to deduct PAYE as George’s employment activities have no necessary connection to New Zealand, and the only connection to New Zealand is that George lives there. George would have to account for his own tax through the New Zealand tax system (see paragraphs 15-18). Example 2: George’s work is highly respected and quite specialised, as he only designs schools. When there is a project to build a new school in Wellington, George is asked by BA to provide his expertise and advice. Would BA have an obligation to deduct PAYE? No. George’s expertise and advice does not require him to be in New Zealand to give it. He is not carrying on operations or employing a workforce (on behalf on BA) in New Zealand to give this advice. Although there is a connection to New Zealand while undertaking his employment activities for this project, this is not enough to impose a PAYE obligation on BA as there is no indication of a trading presence or the utilisation on behalf of BA of resources and labour to subject BA to New Zealand tax law. George would have to account for his own tax through the New Zealand tax system (see paragraphs 15-18). OS 21/04 | 01 December 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Ex ample 3: George’s work on the school went well. When a new school project comes up, BA puts George in charge of dealing with the client and running the project. While some work is also done in the US, 3 more staff are hired in Wellington to help George out. It is hoped that this might be the start of more New Zealand work for BA. Would BA have an obligation to deduct PAYE? Yes. In this situation there is a sufficient presence in New Zealand for BA to have an obligation to deduct PAYE. George (on behalf of BA) is carrying on operations for the purpose of its business, he is entering into and performing contracts in New Zealand (on behalf of BA), and additional staff have been employed on behalf of BA in connection with the project being undertaken in Wellington. Paying PAYE in New Zealand 15. An employee (in New Zealand) will have an obligation to account for and pay their own tax if their employer has no obligation, or does not for any reason, deduct PAYE. 16. As in example one and two, BA does not have an obligation to deduct PAYE from George, therefore George will be required to register as an IR 56 taxpayer, file an Employment Information form and pay any taxes to Inland Revenue. 17. Due to the nature of their work circumstances, IR56 taxpayers are required to account for their own tax. Guidance can be found on the IR website under IR56 taxpayers to help employees manage this process. 18. A non-resident employer can also register voluntarily to be an employer and therefore make the deductions and payments for their employees in New Zealand. The process for doing this can be followed on the IR website under Register as an employer. OS 21/04 | 01 December 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Services performed 19. Where a non-resident employer has made themselves subject to New Zealand law by having a sufficient presence in New Zealand, the extent of the non-resident employer’s obligations will be limited to matters that are properly attributable to their New Zealand presence. 20. This means that if, for example, a non-resident employer carries on a business in New Zealand and pays wages to an employee who performs services that are properly attributable to the New Zealand business, the employer will have an obligation to withhold PAYE from those wages. 21. Most of the time the PAYE withholding obligations will arise where the employee is based in New Zealand. 22. However, it is possible that a New Zealand resident employee could perform services overseas that are properly attributable to the non-resident employers’ New Zealand presence. 23. For example, a New Zealand resident employee may be temporarily based overseas investigating the purchase of new equipment to be used in the employers’ New Zealand operations. The services of the employee would be properly attributable to the New Zealand operations and, therefore, the non-resident employer would be required to withhold PAYE from PAYE income payments made to the employee. Section CW 19 - Amounts derived during short-term visits 24. Under s CW 19, income that a non-resident person derives in a tax year from performing personal or professional services in New Zealand during a visit is exempt income if:  The visit is for 92 or fewer days (counting the day of arrival and departure as whole days);  The person is present in New Zealand for 92 days or fewer in total in each 12- month period that includes the period of the visit;  The services are performed for or on behalf of a person (which could include an employer) who is not resident in New Zealand; OS 21/04 | 01 December 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  The income is chargeable with income tax in the country in which the person is resident. 25. Exempt income is excluded from the definition of “salary or wages” and, therefore a “PAYE income payment 4 ” is also exempt under this provision. No PAYE withholding obligation will arise for any payments described in s CW 19. Relief given by a DTA 26. No PAYE withholding obligation will arise for PAYE income payments where a DTA provides the employee with relief from New Zealand taxation. 27 A DTA may have the effect of denying New Zealand any taxing rights for an amount of employment income derived by a non-resident employee for employment services performed in New Zealand. This may occur if the non-resident employee is in New Zealand for in total, 183 days or less in a twelve-month period, the remuneration is paid by a non-resident employer, and the remuneration is neither borne by nor deductible in determining the profits attributable to a permanent establishment which the employer has in New Zealand. 28. Please note, the example above assumes the wording of the DTA as described, although this wording may vary slightly within different DTA’s with regards to the taxing rights for employment income. New Zealand resident employers 29. An issue with regards to payments by a New Zealand resident employer is whether there is an obligation to withhold PAYE where the PAYE income payment is paid to a non-resident employee for work performed overseas. 30. It is considered that a New Zealand resident employer does not have any obligation to withhold PAYE from a PAYE income payment that is “non-residents’ foreign- sourced income” 5 for the employee. This is because: 4 “PAYE income payment” is principally defined by reference to “salary or wages” which excludes an amount of exempt income (s RD 5(1)(c)(i)). 5 As defined in s BD 1(4). OS 21/04 | 01 December 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  The Core Provisions indicate that the purpose of the Act is to tax assessable income. Income tax is generally not intended to apply to non-residents’ foreign-sourced income; certainly not in the case of employment income.  It would be inconsistent with the purpose of the Act to impose a PAYE withholding obligation on the employer in relation to such income. Example 4: Sarah is a UK resident and lives in London. She has never been to New Zealand. She is employed by a New Zealand Company that resides in New Zealand and does all her work remotely in the UK for this company. The income she receives as an employee is considered to be “non-resident foreign sourced income” and is therefore not assessable income in New Zealand. Sarah is not required to file a tax return in New Zealand. As this income is not assessable to Sarah in New Zealand, the New Zealand Company does not have an obligation to deduct PAYE or any employment related taxes. The New Zealand Company would need to account for Sarah’s income as an expense in their accounts and will not be required to add Sarah to their Employment Information Schedule. Employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) 31. A non-resident employer who has made themselves subject to New Zealand’s law by having a sufficient presence in New Zealand, and who pays PAYE income payments, may have a liability for ESCT. Like the situation for PAYE on a PAYE income payment, the employer’s superannuation contribution would have to relate to employment services that are properly attributable to the employer’s presence in New Zealand. 32. This means that, for a non-resident employer, an ESCT liability will normally only arise when the employee is performing services in New Zealand. However, a non-resident employer could have an ESCT liability for a contribution made for the benefit of an employee working overseas, if the services provided by the employee overseas are properly attributable to the employer’s New Zealand presence. OS 21/04 | 01 December 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 33. A non-resident employer who has not made themselves subject to New Zealand’s jurisdiction has no liability for ESCT. This is so whether or not the employee is a New Zealand resident and whether or not the employment services are performed in New Zealand or overseas. Fringe benefit tax (FBT) 34. A non-resident employer who has made themselves subject to New Zealand’s jurisdiction by having a sufficient presence in New Zealand, and who pays PAYE income payments, will have a liability for FBT (subject to the discussion below). Like the situation for PAYE on a PAYE income payment, for an FBT liability to arise the provision of a fringe benefit to an employee would have to be a benefit provided to an employee in connection with the employer’s presence in New Zealand. 35. This means that, for a non-resident employer, an FBT liability will normally only arise where the employee is performing services in New Zealand. However, a non-resident employer could have an FBT liability for a benefit provided to an employee working overseas, if the services provided by the employee overseas are properly attributable to the employer’s New Zealand operations. 36. An FBT liability will also depend on other factors, including whether the employee has received a PAYE income payment in the period. Additionally, s CX 26 provides that a benefit is not a fringe benefit to the extent to which it is received in a quarter or an income year in which they derive one or more PAYE income payments, all of which are not liable for income tax. 37. A non-resident employer who has not made themselves subject to New Zealand’s jurisdiction has no liability for FBT. This Statement was signed on 1 December 2021.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Available Subscribed Capital record- keeping requirements Issued: 11 March 2022 OS 22/01 Operational statements set out the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s view of the law in respect of the matter discussed and deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Statement sets out the Commissioner’s approach to applying the statutory record- keeping requirements that are necessary to substantiate distributions of Available Subscribed Capital (ASC). All legislative references in this Statement are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless specified otherwise. This Statement applies from the date of issue. OS 22/01 | 11 March 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Introduction This Statement sets out the Commissioner’s approach to the record-keeping requirements necessary to substantiate an amount returned to a shareholder tax-free, as a distribution of Available Subscribed Capital (ASC). For an amount to be distributed tax-free it will need to not be caught under the definition of a dividend. What is a dividend? 1. A transfer of value from a company to a person will be a dividend (and therefore income to that person) 1 if: • the cause of the transfer is a shareholding in the company; 2 and • none of the statutory exclusions apply. 3 2. While the definition of a dividend is wide, it is subject to several statutory exclusions. These are set out in ss CD 22 – 37. Sections CD 22 Returns of capital: off-market share cancellations and CD 26 Capital distributions on liquidation or emigration cover exclusions involving ASC. The purpose of ASC – Return of capital 3. The purpose of calculating the ASC of a company is to determine the amount of capital that shareholders have paid into the company when subscribing for shares. This amount can generally be returned to the shareholders free of tax when there is a repurchase of shares or the company is liquidated (under either ss CD 22 or CD 26), so comes within the statutory exclusion from the definition of dividend in s CD 4 Transfers of company value generally. The calculation rules for ASC are provided for in s CD 43 Available subscribed capital (ASC) amount. 4. However, the Commissioner has seen a number of cases where there are concerns around the company’s calculation of ASC and the taxpayers have been unable to provide sufficient information when requested, as they have not retained sufficient records to substantiate their tax positions taken at the time that the distribution was made. 1 Section CD 1. 2 Section CD 4(1)(a). 3 Section CD 4(1)(b). OS 22/01 | 11 March 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5. This leads to questions around the basis for the tax position that the distributions are tax-free. It is noted that this has often happened where there has been a period of time in excess of 7 years from when the amount of ASC increased (ASC uplift) to when the distribution occurs (purporting to utilise the ASC uplift) and the tax position is taken (i.e., that the distribution is a tax-free return of capital). Operational approach 6. The Commissioner may, in cases where the taxpayer has not been able to provide sufficient evidence to support their ASC calculation, dispute the taxpayer’s tax position on the basis that the distribution is a dividend under s CD 4. This is consistent with the onus of proof in s 149A(2)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA) resting with the taxpayer (see below). 7. The reasoning for this approach is as follows: • The taxpayer company has made a distribution to the shareholder (i.e., a transfer of value from the company to the shareholder). 4 • The cause of the transfer is the shareholding in the company. 5 • None of the exclusions from the definition of dividend apply. 6 The onus of proof 8. The onus of proof is on the taxpayer to show that the basis for their self-assessment is correct (i.e., their tax position that the distribution is excluded from being a dividend because it is sheltered by ASC under either ss CD 22 or CD 26). A taxpayer needs to be able to provide sufficient evidence to support their position that they have enough ASC to shelter the distribution from being a dividend. 9. Section 22 Keeping of business and other records of the TAA lays out the record- keeping requirements. Under s 22(2), taxpayers are required to keep sufficient records to allow the Commissioner to ascertain a taxpayer’s tax position for a period of at least 7 years after the end of the income year to which they relate. A taxpayer may also be 4 Section CD 4(1). 5 Section CD 4(1)(a). 6 Sections CD 22 to CD 37. OS 22/01 | 11 March 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] required to keep their records for a further 3 years because of audit or investigation activity. 7 10. The formula for calculating ASC includes, amongst other elements, the 1 July 1994 balance and the consideration that the company received for the issue of shares after 30 June 1994 (i.e., the amount contributed by shareholders). 8 Given this requirement, the ASC formula is clear that the calculation of ASC can require consideration of circumstances that happened more than 7 years ago (including, for example, the 1 July 1994 balance). A taxpayer taking a tax position based on the company’s level of ASC would, consistent with the onus of proof, need to be able to substantiate the ASC calculation (and to be able to provide this information to the Commissioner - if requested). This is the case irrespective of whether the events feeding into that calculation may have happened more than 7 years ago. 11. Therefore, in line with the ASC calculation requirements and the statutory onus of proof being on the company, Inland Revenue would, in such cases, expect the company to keep sufficient records of their calculation of ASC, so that they are able to substantiate their tax position. 12. This operational approach is consistent with a number of other parts of the Act where a tax position may be taken based on (or taking into account) events or circumstances that may have happened more than 7 years ago and where taxpayers will need to keep sufficient records to substantiate their tax positions. 9 13. This Operational Statement is based on the Commissioner’s view of the law at the date of issue and applies until the statement is withdrawn, amended or any law change occurs. 14.

Introduction 1. The trust information gathering powers in s 59BA apply for the 2021-22 and later income years. The retrospective trust information gathering powers in s 59BAB were introduced for periods beginning after the end of the 2013-14 income year. 2. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021-22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Act 2022 amended s 59BA to exclude minor and incidental non-cash distributions from the information required to be included with any return and to also exclude foreign trusts required to file a return from having to provide the further information required by s 59BA(2). 3. As outlined in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 33 Number 3 (April 2021) (at pp 5-8) the purpose of trust information gathering powers is to collect further information from trustees to: 3.1. gain insight into whether the top personal tax rate of 39% is working effectively; and 3.2. to provide better information to understand and monitor the use of structures and entities by trustees. 4. The Commissioner may use the information collected for compliance and audit purposes. Summary 5. The key points discussed in this Statement are summarised as follows: 5.1. Obligation to file returns 5.2. Order in Council (OIC) 5.3. Information required 5.3.1. A statement of profit or loss and a statement of financial position 5.3.2. Settlor & settlement details 5.3.3. Beneficiary & distribution details 5.3.4. Persons with powers of appointment \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.4. Excluded trusts 5.5. Persons responsible for performance 5.6. Variation to the requirements 5.7. Retrospective collection 6. Trustees who derive assessable income must file a return under s 59BA(1) for the tax year of all income derived in the corresponding income year in the form prescribed by the Commissioner. Unless the trust is an excluded trust under s 59BA(3), the trustees are also required to include the information set out in s 59BA(2)(a) to (f). 7. The obligation to provide further information with the return is different from the obligation to maintain the financial statements required by the Tax Administration (Financial Statements – Domestic Trusts) Order 2022 (the OIC). Trustees who derive assessable income are obliged to prepare the financial statements required by the OIC (see 25 for more information) but these financial statements are not required to be provided to the Commissioner (unless the Commissioner requests them). 8. Certain information will need to be copied from the financial statements and included in the tax return filed with the Commissioner. This Operational Statement sets out what information the Commissioner requires to be provided with the tax return in order to comply with s 59BA. 9. The following flowchart summarises who is, and who is not, required to comply with s 59BA: \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Obligation to file returns 10. Section 59BA(1) sets out the requirement for a trustee of a trust that derives assessable income to file a return. 59BA Annual return for trusts (1) A trustee of a trust who derives assessable income for a tax year must file a return for the tax year of all income derived in the corresponding income year by the trustee as trustee of the trust. 11. All trustees of a trust, except a non-active complying trust, who derive assessable income for a tax year must file a return for all income derived in the corresponding income year. 12. Assessable income is defined in sections YA 1 and BD 1(5) of the ITA. Assessable income does not include exempt, excluded or non-residents’ foreign sourced income. 13. Section 59BA(3) excludes certain trustees from the requirement under s 59BA(2) to include further information in the return. Even if not required to include the further information, if a trustee derives assessable income, they must still file a return of that income. Non-Active Complying Trusts 14. Section 43B allows trustees of a non-active complying trust to be excused from the obligation to furnish a return of income if the trust meets certain requirements. 43B Trustees of non-active trusts and administrators or executors of non-active estates may be excused from filing returns (1) A person who is a trustee of a trust or an administrator or executor of an estate is not required to make a return of income for a tax year for the trust or estate if— (a) the trust or estate is non-active throughout the income year corresponding to the tax year; and (b) for a person who is a trustee, the trust is a complying trust under \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] section HC 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007; and (c) the person has provided to the Commissioner, in a form approved by the Commissioner,— (i) a declaration that the trust or estate is non-active and that the person will notify the Commissioner if the trust or estate ceases to be non-active; and (ii) a statement of the matters required by the Commissioner. (2) For the purposes of this section, a trust or estate is non-active for a tax year if, throughout the income year corresponding to the tax year, the trustee of the trust or the administrator or executor of the estate— (a) has not derived any income; and (b) has no deductions; and (c) has not been a party to, or perpetuated, or continued with, transactions with assets of the trust or estate which, during the corresponding income year,— (i) give rise to income in any person’s hands; or (ii) give rise to fringe benefits to an employee or to a former employee. (3) In determining whether a trust or estate complies with the requirements of subsection (2), no account shall be taken of any— (a) reasonable fees paid to professional persons to administer the trust or estate; or (b) bank charges or other minimal administration costs totalling not more than $200 in the tax year; or (c) interest earned on trust or estate assets in any bank account during the tax year, to the extent to which the total interest does not exceed $200; or (d) insurance, rates, and other expenditure incidental to the occupation of a dwelling owned by the trust or estate and incurred by the beneficiaries of the trust or estate. (4) Where at any time any paragraph of subsection (2) ceases to apply to a trust or estate for which a declaration under this section has been made, a trustee of the trust or administrator or executor of the estate must notify the Commissioner that the trust or estate has ceased to be a non-active. (5) Despite subsection (1), a person who is a trustee of a non-active trust or an executor or administrator of a non-active estate must furnish a return of income if required by the Commissioner to do so. 15. A trustee of a trust who wishes to be excused, under s 43B, from the requirement to \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] furnish a return of income must make a declaration that it is a non-active complying trust (currently the IR633). 16. If at any time the trust no longer meets the requirements to be eligible for non- active status it must notify Inland Revenue and furnish a return of income for the relevant year. Example 1 – non-active status The Jane Smith Trust owns a residential property that is occupied by Jane Smith (a beneficiary of the trust). The holding costs of the property (rates & insurance) are paid by Jane, and she does not pay rent to the trust. The trust also has an interest-bearing bank account and has advised their bank to deduct withholding tax from interest earned at 33%. The total interest earned by the Trust is less than $200 per year. The Trust has an IRD number and has historically included only the interest income in its income tax return. The trust meets the criteria for non-active status so completes an IR633 and provides it to Inland Revenue. Whilst it continues to meet the relevant criteria the trustees no longer have any obligation to file returns and therefore do not have to comply with the additional information disclosures required by s 59BA(2). If, at any stage, the trust no longer meets the relevant criteria for non-active status the trustees need to let Inland Revenue know and start filing annual income tax returns. 17. If a trustee of a trust does not make the declaration as required by s 43B(1)(c) but is otherwise eligible to be excused from filing a return as a non-active complying trust, the trustee will still be required to comply with the requirements of s 59BA if they derive assessable income. Example 2 – eligible for non-active status but no declaration made The Bill Burns Trust owns a residential property that is occupied by Bill Burns (a beneficiary of the trust). The holding costs of the property (rates & insurance) are paid by Bill, and he does not pay rent to the trust. The trust also has an interest-bearing bank account and has advised their bank to deduct withholding tax from interest earned at 33%. The total interest earned by the Trust is less than $200 per year. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Although the trust meets the criteria for non-active status, the trustees have not completed a non-active declaration and the trust is required to file income tax returns as it is not excused from doing so under s 43B. As the trust has derived assessable income and is required to file an income tax return, the trustees will be required to comply with the full s 59BA(2) disclosure requirements. Bare Trusts 18. A bare trust is a type of trust under which the trustee holds property on trust without any duties to perform other than to convey the trust property to the beneficiary or as the beneficiary directs. See Question We’ve Been Asked 16/03 Goods and services tax – GST treatment of bare trusts. 19. A bare trustee has been described as: ... a person who holds property in trust for the absolute benefit and at the absolute disposal of other persons who are of full age and mental capacity in respect of it, and who has himself no present beneficial interest in it and no duties to perform in respect of it except to convey or transfer it to persons entitled to hold it, and he is bound to convey or transfer the property accordingly when required to do so. Disputant Q v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2015\] NZTRA 22 20. Section YB 21 of the ITA clarifies that a trustee of a bare trust is a nominee, and that if a person holds something or does something as a nominee for another person, the other person holds or does that thing and the nominee is ignored. YB 21 Transparency of nominees Treatment of nominee (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, if a person holds something or does something as a nominee for another person, the other person holds or does that thing and the nominee is ignored. Who is a nominee? (2) A person holds or does something as a nominee for another person if the person acts on the other person’s behalf. However, a trustee is a nominee only if the trustee is a bare trustee. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Nominal settlements (3) A person making a nominal settlement at the request of another person is treated for the purposes of this Act as a nominee in relation to the settlement.... 21. Funds held in a trust account which are held on bare trust, such as money received by a practitioner under s 110 of the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006, are held by the person as a nominee for another person and the nominee is ignored. 22. The trustee of a bare trust is treated as not deriving any assessable income on their own behalf, as the trustee in that instance is a nominee and is therefore ignored. 23. As the trustee of a bare trust is treated as not deriving any assessable income, there is no obligation for the trustee to file an income tax return under s 59BA(1), or to comply with the additional disclosure requirements of s 59BA(2). 24. A trustee who holds funds in a trust account, on bare trust, such as a solicitor’s trust account, is not required to file a return under s 59BA(1). It is not intended to list all the trust accounts that are considered by the Commissioner as bare trusts and not all trust accounts will be bare trusts; it will depend on the nature of the trust upon which the funds are held. Tax Administration (Financial Statements — Domestic Trusts) Order 2022 – the OIC. 25. A trustee who is required to file a return that complies with s 59BA(2) must prepare financial statements in accordance with the applicable minimum requirements prescribed in the OIC; see s 21B(2) and clause 4 of the OIC. 26. For trust disclosure purposes, “financial statements” are the financial statements required to be prepared in accordance with the OIC and the “statement of profit and loss and statement of financial position” are the statement of profit and loss and statement of financial position required by s 59BA(2) to be included with the return. 27. If a trustee is not required to file a return that complies with s 59BA(2), then they are not required to prepare the financial statements required by the OIC. 28. While the financial statements are not required to be provided to the Commissioner with the return, they must be available if the Commissioner later requests them. The \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] information required to be provided with the return (the statement of profit and loss and statement of financial position) should be copied from the OIC financial statements. Minimum requirement for preparing financial statements 29. The minimum requirements for preparing the financial statements and the matters that the financial statements must show are set out in clause 5 and the Schedule of the OIC. Simplified Reporting Trust 30. Not all of the minimum requirements in clause 5 and the Schedule of the OIC apply to a simplified reporting trust. 31. A trust is a simplified reporting trust in relation to an income year if: 31.1. the trustee of the trust derives assessable income of less than $100,000; and 31.2. the deductible expenditure or loss incurred during the income year by the trustee of the trust is less than $100,000; and 31.3. the amount of total assets of the trust as at the end of the income year (or an accounting period if permitted) is less than $5 million. 32. For the purposes of determining if a trust is a simplified reporting trust: 32.1. Assessable income has the same meaning as in s BD 1 of the ITA (and includes both beneficiary and trustee income referred to in s HC 5 of that Act) but does not include an amount of income derived under s CB 6A of the ITA (bright-line test for residential land income). 32.2. Deductible expenditure or loss means a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss that is allowed under Part D of the ITA but does not include a deduction allowed under s DB 23 of the ITA (revenue account property deduction). 32.3. The amount of the total assets must: 32.3.1. include all assets whether or not they are revenue account property as defined in s YA 1 of the ITA; and \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 13 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 32.3.2. in relation to each asset that are shares or ownership interests, land or buildings, be calculated using the same valuation principle that is disclosed for the asset in the financial statements; and 32.3.3. be consistent with the amounts disclosed in the financial statements. 33. Simplified reporting trusts do not have to: 33.1. apply the principles of accrual accounting. They can use cash-basis accounting in the preparation of their financial statements; 33.2. include a statement of accounting policies; 33.3. disclose comparable figures for the pervious income year (or accounting period if permitted); 33.4. include a reconciliation of the profit and loss in the statement of profit and loss with the trustee’s taxable income for the income year; 33.5. include a schedule of the trust’s fixed assets and depreciable property; 33.6. include, if the trustee derives income from forestry, information about the cost of timber as at the end of the income year (or accounting period if permitted) or a reconciliation of movements in the cost of timber during the year; 33.7. include, if the trust includes specified livestock, details of livestock valuation methods, valuations and calculations for tax purposes; 33.8. include, for each transaction in connection with the trust that is entered into between the trustee and any associated person, the name of the associated person, the nature of the association or the nature of the transaction including the amounts involved. 34. Being a simplified reporting trust does not exempt the trustees from preparing financial statements nor from their obligation to file a return and include the information required by s 59BA(2). It only modifies the way in which financial statements are compiled in order to meet minimum standards required the OIC. 35. A simplified reporting trust will still need to file a return and provide the information required by s 59BA(2). The trustee will be able to use the information in the simplified reporting trust financial statements in their s 59BA return. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 14 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Prior year comparable figures 36. A trustee is only required to prepare financial statements in years that the trustee derives assessable income and is also required to provide the information required by s 59BA(2). 37. The minimum standards for financial statements include, for trusts that are not simplified reporting trusts, a requirement to disclose comparable figures for the previous income year (or accounting period if permitted). 38. In a year that a trustee is required to prepare financial statements and where that year follows a year that the trustee is not required to prepare financial statements, the financial statements will be required to disclose comparable figures only to the extent that the trustee has that information. Thus, if that information has not been prepared and/or is not held by the trustees for the prior year, the comparable figures will not be required to be disclosed, although it is likely that some information will be prepared or held due to the requirements of the Trusts Act 2019 to keep financial records. 39. Section 45 of the Trusts Act 2019 requires that trustees must keep “records of the trust property that identify the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of the trust”, so it is expected that trustees will maintain sufficient records to calculate the opening balances of assets, liabilities, and equity (discussed further at \[52\] to \[58\]) for any year that they are required to prepare financial statements. 40. The first year for which the financial statements are required to be prepared to the minimum standards is the 2021-22 income year. As trustees may not have previously prepared financial statements, or have prepared statements to a lower standard, the requirement to disclose comparable figures is only required to the extent that the trustee has that information. Associated persons transactions 41. The minimum standards for financial statements include, for trusts that are not simplified reporting trusts, a requirement to disclose information about transactions with associated persons: 41.1. the name of the associated person; and 41.2. the nature of the association with the associated person; and 41.3. the nature of the transaction, including the amounts involved. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 15 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 42. Certain transactions are not required to be disclosed in the financial statements if: 42.1. it is a minor transaction that is incidental to the activities of the trust; or 42.2. is at market value; or 42.3. the trustee has already separately disclosed the information required by this clause to the Commissioner in a form prescribed by the Commissioner under section 35. 43. Transactions that are not required to be disclosed in the financial statements as they will be separately disclosed in a prescribed form include (this is not intended to be an exhaustive list): 43.1. Settlements; 43.2. Distributions; 43.3. Beneficiary current account balances and any movements in the account during the year; 43.4. The year end balances of financial arrangements between the trust and associated persons. 44. A trustee may not have the necessary information to be able to provide all of the required details of transactions with associated persons for the 2021-22 year and, accordingly, only needs to include as much information in the financial statements for that year as they are reasonably able to provide. 59BA(2) Information required 45. Section 59BA(2) sets out the additional information trustees (who are required to file a return and are not excluded by s 59BA(3)) are required to provide for the 2021-22 tax year onwards. 59BA Annual return for trusts (1) ... (2) A trustee who is required to file a return for a tax year under subsection (1) and does not meet the requirements of subsection (3) must make the return \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 16 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] in the form prescribed by the Commissioner and include, unless otherwise required by the Commissioner,— (a) a statement of profit or loss and a statement of financial position: (b) the amount, and nature, of each settlement that— (i) is not the provision to the trustee, at less than market value, of minor services incidental to the activities of the trust; and (ii) is made on the trust in the income year: (c) the name, date of birth, jurisdiction of tax residence, and tax file number and taxpayer identification number, of each settlor who makes a settlement on the trust in the income year or whose details have not previously been supplied to the Commissioner: (d) the amount, and nature, of each distribution that— (i) is not a distribution, other than of money, that is minor and incidental to the activities of the trust; and (ii) is made by the trustee in the income year: (db) the name, date of birth, jurisdiction of tax residence, and tax file number and taxpayer identification number, of the beneficiary who receives a distribution referred to in paragraph (d): (e) the name, date of birth, jurisdiction of tax residence, and tax file number and taxpayer identification number, of each person having a power under the trust to appoint or dismiss a trustee, to add or remove a beneficiary, or to amend the trust deed: (f) the other information required by the Commissioner. 59BA(2)(a) Statement of profit or loss 46. The financial statements required to be prepared to the minimum standards in the OIC will encompass all trust income and expenditure for the year, as prescribed by the OIC. 47. The following items relating to profit or loss that are required to be included in the return, using the relevant prescribed form, are a sub-set of the information captured in the financial statements: 47.1. Total accounting profit before tax 47.2. Tax adjustments 47.3. Untaxed realised gains/receipts \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 17 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 48. The sum of the trust’s accounting profit before tax plus tax adjustments will reconcile to the total income of the trust (which is then allocated to beneficiaries or retained as trustee income). Rather than a profit, the trust may make a loss and this will be included in the return. A loss cannot be distributed to a beneficiary but can be carried forward to the following year by the trustee. 49. Some terminology used in the return may seem more applicable to companies, such as “equity” and “drawings”. These terms are used in relation to the profit and loss and statement of financial position for trusts, which are accounting documents, and are to be read in context. Thus, although legally a beneficiary may not have “equity” in a trust, for accounting purposes for the return, the “equity” is the net assets of the trust. Similarly, for “drawings”, legally a beneficiary may not take “drawings” from a trust, but for accounting purposes for the return, distributions from the trust are recorded in the “beneficiary account” and the beneficiary, when receiving assets (e.g. money) from the trust, is recorded as taking “drawings” from the “beneficiary account”. 59BA(2)(a) Statement of financial position 50. The financial statements required to be prepared to the minimum standards in the OIC will encompass all trust assets, liabilities and equity, as prescribed by the OIC. 51. The following items relating to assets, liabilities and equity are required to be included in the return, using the relevant prescribed form; they should be copied from the information captured in the financial statements: 51.1. Assets: Associated persons financial arrangements 51.1.1. This should encompass all loans to persons associated with the trust (excluding certain beneficiary accounts which are represented under the category “Current account year-end balances”). 51.1.2. “Associated persons” has the same meaning as in subpart YB of the ITA. For more guidance, refer to IR620 – Associated persons definitions for income tax purposes. 51.2. Assets: Land 51.2.1. The trustee will need to value land and buildings separately. This may be done by using the apportionment used in the most recent rating valuation under the Ratings Valuations Act 1998. However, if the purchase price allocation rules in s GC 20 of ITA were \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 18 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] applied to determine the purchase price of an asset, then the same apportionment methodology must be used in the year the land is acquired and can be used in future years. 51.2.2. The valuation methodology used will need to be disclosed. 51.2.3. The available valuation methodologies as prescribed in the OIC are: 51.2.3.1. Historical cost with impairment or depreciation as appropriate: 51.2.3.2. Tax value, but only in relation to assets that produce assessable income (including income derived on the sale of the asset): 51.2.3.3. Market value (which may include, as a proxy for the market value, the most recent rating valuation). 51.2.4. Where there is more than one asset in a particular asset category and different valuation methodologies have been applied, then the valuation method that reflects the highest proportion of assets in the category in terms of dollar value should be disclosed on the return. Example 3 – valuation methodology The Jane Smith Trust owns two properties. One is a residential property occupied by a beneficiary of the trust, Jane Smith, and does not produce assessable income. The other is a non-residential property rented to a third- party tenant, deriving assessable income. The residential property is able to be valued at cost or market value, tax value is not available because the property is not used to derive assessable income. Any of the three valuation methodologies can be used for the second rented property. The cost of the residential property was $500,000, the most recent rating valuation valued the property at $850,000 with a 60:40 split between land & improvements (buildings). The trustees can choose to record the residential property at either valuation amount in their financial statements and statement of financial position, and the 60:40 split between land and buildings can be used to apportion both the \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 19 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] cost price or the market value for the purposes of splitting the amount into the two categories (land and buildings) listed in the financial statements and statement of financial position. The rented property cost $650,000 and has a current rating valuation of $1,200,000 with a 70:30 split between land and buildings. The tax value of the property is $647,000 because it has been subject to depreciation. The trustees can choose to record the rented property at either of the three valuation amounts in their financial statements, and the 70:30 split between land and buildings can be used to apportion the value between land & buildings. If the asset price was already allocated between land & buildings using a different methodology at an earlier time then that methodology can continue to be used. If the trustees choose to value the residential property at market value ($850,000) and the rented at tax value ($650,000 - $3,000 depreciation claimed) and uses the rating apportionment to split the amounts between land & buildings as follows: Residential land ($850,000 \* 60%) $510,000 Non-residential land ($650,000 \* 70%) $455,000 The total value of land recorded in the financial statements and statement of financial position will be $965,000. The valuation methodology disclosed in the return will be market value, which reflects the methodology used for the highest proportion of value in the asset category (being the rented property). Residential building ($850,000 \* 40%) $340,000 Non-residential building ($650,000 \* 30% - $3,000) $192,000 The total value of buildings recorded in the financial statements and statement of financial position will be $532,000. The valuation methodology disclosed in the return will be market value, which reflects the methodology used for the highest proportion of value in the asset category. NOTE: if the purchase price allocation rules in s GC 20 of the ITA apply to determine the purchase price of an asset then the same apportionment methodology may continue to be used. 51.3. Assets: Buildings 51.3.1. As noted above, the trustee will need to value land and buildings separately and this may be done by using the apportionment used in the most recent rating valuation under the Ratings Valuations Act 1998. However, if the purchase price allocation \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 20 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] rules in s GC 20 of ITA were applied to determine the purchase price of an asset, then the same apportionment methodology must be used in the year that the building is acquired and can be used in future years. 51.3.2. The valuation methodology used will need to be disclosed. Refer to the comments above for the available valuation methodologies and how to disclose them on the return if more than one method has been used for an asset category. 51.4. Assets: Shares / Ownership Interests 51.4.1. The valuation methodology used will need to be disclosed. Refer to the comments above for the available valuation methodologies and how to disclose on the return if more than one method has been used for an asset category. 51.5. Assets: Total assets 51.5.1. Total assets are all assets, including amounts recorded in the above four categories. 51.6. Liabilities: Associated persons financial arrangements 51.6.1. This should encompass all loans from persons associated with the trust (excluding beneficiary accounts which are represented under the category “Current account year-end balances”). 51.6.2. Note that beneficiary accounts payable on demand are not recorded in the “Liabilities: Associated persons financial arrangements” but are recorded in the “Current account year-end balances”. These categories are found in the prescribed forms. 51.6.3. “Associated persons” has the same meaning as in subpart YB of the ITA. For more guidance, please refer to IR620 Associated persons definitions for income tax purposes. 51.7. Liabilities: Total liabilities 51.7.1. Total liabilities are all liabilities, including amounts recorded in the above category. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 21 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 51.8. Equity: 51.8.1. The equity is the value of the net assets of the trust. The statement of financial position should record the equity into the following three components (owners’ equity, drawings, and current account year-end balances). 51.8.2. The IR6G Estate and trust return guide provides further details around what these items are expected to represent in the return. 51.9. Equity: Owners’ equity 51.9.1. A trust does not have an “owner” or “equity”, but for the trust disclosure rules, the term “owners’ equity” is used and means the total trust corpus and total trust capital. 51.9.2. Trust corpus is the sum of all settlements made on the trust less the sum of all distributions of trust corpus made to beneficiaries over the life of the trust. Trust capital is the net assets less the trust corpus. 51.9.3. A settlement that does not increase the trust corpus (because the settlement does not give rise to value that can be distributed to beneficiaries; see 59BA(2)(b) The amount and nature of each settlement below) are not included in the statement of financial position but are included in the disclosures of settlements. 51.9.4. Trust capital is the sum of all taxable and non-taxable income retained and gains/losses made by the trust less the sum of all distributions of trust capital made to the beneficiaries over the life of the trust. 51.9.5. Owners’ equity does not include beneficiary accounts as this is represented under the category “Current account year-end balances”. 51.10. Equity: Drawings 51.10.1. Drawings in the context of a trust should reflect the total amount of funds/assets/value withdrawn from the trust by beneficiaries during the year. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 22 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 51.11. Equity: Current account year-end balances 51.11.1. The current account year-end balances, in the context of a trust, should reflect the closing balance of all beneficiary accounts at the end of the year. 51.11.2. Current account year-end balances are discussed further at paragraphs \[59\] to \[61\]. Movements in beneficiary current accounts also need to be disclosed. Opening balances 52. A trustee will need to calculate the opening balances of assets, liabilities and equity in order to calculate the closing balances for the purposes of preparing financial statements to the minimum standards prescribed in the OIC, for each year that they are required to make the s 59BA(2) disclosures. 53. The comparable figures may not be known for the 2021-22 income year and these are not expected to be included in the financial statements required by the OIC for the 2021-22 income year except to the extent that the trustee has that information. 54. Consistent with the ongoing disclosure requirements, the opening valuation of assets and liabilities should be based on: 54.1. Historical cost with impairment and depreciation as appropriate; or 54.2. Tax value, but only in relation to assets that produce assessable income (including income derived on the sale of the asset); or 54.3. Market value (which may include, as a proxy for market value, the most recent rating valuation under the Rating Valuations Act 1998). 55. The trustee can choose the valuation method but must use the same valuation method in the financial statements (OIC) and the statement of profit and loss and statement of financial position (s 59BA(2)). 56. The value of net assets, which is the equity of the trust, should reflect the difference between the value of total assets and total liabilities. For the 2021-22 tax year, the net assets should be allocated between Trust Corpus, Trust Capital and the respective Beneficiary Accounts, as accurately as possible based on known information. In future years, the trustee should be able to accurately record the opening and closing balances based on the movement in assets and liabilities. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 23 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 57. Trustees will not be required to re-create records for the lifetime of the trust but will be required to value and record all the assets held by the trust as at the beginning of the 2021-22 tax year. 58. As noted above in \[39\], s 45 of the Trusts Act 2019 requires that trustees must keep “records of the trust property that identify the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of the trust”, so it is expected that going forward trustees will maintain sufficient records to calculate the opening balances of assets, liabilities, and equity for any year that they are required to prepare financial statements. Trust beneficiary details: movements in beneficiary accounts 59. Trustees will be required to provide a reconciliation, on a line-by-line basis, from the opening to closing balance of all beneficiary accounts. For the purposes of movements in the beneficiary’s account, beneficiary income that is allocated to the income year in the period after the end of the income year referred to in s HC 6(1B) of the ITA is not included the reconciliations. 60. At a minimum, the return will be required to include in relation to the reconciliation of beneficiary accounts for an income year: 60.1. Opening balance of the beneficiary’s account 60.2. ADD: Distributions 60.2.1. A trustee can make distributions to beneficiaries made up of: 60.2.1.1. Accounting income. 60.2.1.2. Capital gains of the trust. 60.2.1.3. Corpus of the trust. 60.2.1.4. The provision of trust property/services at less than market value. 60.2.1.5. Any debt owed by the beneficiary to the trust that has been forgiven by the trustee. 60.2.1.6. Other transfers of value that vest absolutely in the beneficiary. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 24 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 60.2.2. A trustee must disclose all distributions made by the trust during the year (not just beneficiary income as has been required in the past). 60.2.3. A distribution, other than of money, that is minor and incidental to the activities of the trust does not need to be included in the financial statements or statement of financial position. 60.2.4. Refer to the IR6G Estate or trust return guide for the different categories that the distributions are to be broken down into on the return. 60.3. DEDUCT: Drawings 60.3.1. Drawings will include: 60.3.1.1. The provision of trust property enjoyed by the beneficiary (use of trust property/services for less than market value, distribution of trust assets (other than cash) and any debt owed by the beneficiary to the trust that has been forgiven by the trustee). 60.3.1.2. Cash or other assets paid out from the Trust during the year. 60.3.1.3. Tax paid on behalf of the beneficiary. 60.3.2. The total amount of Drawings by all beneficiaries is disclosed as part of the statement of financial position in the Equity section, as discussed at \[51.10\]. 60.4. EQUALS: Closing balance of the beneficiary’s account 60.4.1. The closing balances of all beneficiary accounts is disclosed as part of the statement of financial position in the Equity section ( Current account year-end balances), as discussed at \[51.11\]. 61. A beneficiary account reconciliation will be required for every beneficiary who has had a movement in their beneficiary account during the year. 59BA(2)(b) The amount and nature of each settlement 62. For each settlement made in any income year the trustee will be required to disclose: \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 25 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 62.1. The amount of the settlement 62.2. The nature of the settlement 63. The amount of any settlement will be determined in line with s HC 4(1B) of the ITA: HC 4 Corpus of trust Meaning of corpus (1) In the trust rules, corpus for a trust means the settlement value under subsection (1B) of property settled on the trust that is not excluded by subsection (2). Settlement value of settled property (1B) For property meeting the requirements of subsection (1), the value under this subsection (the settlement value) of the property settled on a trust is— (a) the market value of the property determined at the time of the settlement of the property, for a single settlement on the trust; or (b) the total of the amounts determined under paragraph (a) for each settlement of property, if the trustee treats the settlements in the way permitted by section HC 3 Settlements excluded from corpus (2) Corpus does not include an amount equal to the market value of the property settlements described in subsections (3) to (5). Settlements on other trusts (3) A property settlement by a trustee of another trust is excluded from corpus to the extent to which, if the property were distributed to a beneficiary of the other trust, and the beneficiary was resident in New Zealand, the distribution would be beneficiary income or a taxable distribution to that beneficiary. Deductions (4) A property settlement for which the settlor is allowed a deduction is excluded from corpus. Income or dividend (5) A property settlement is excluded from corpus if, but for the fact of the settlement,— (a) it would be income of the settlor; or (b) \[Repealed\] (c) it would fall under paragraph (a) if the settlor were resident in New Zealand at the time of the settlement. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 26 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 64. For the purposes of s 59BA(2)(b) the amount of a settlement is the same amount that is recognised as corpus of the trust, which for most settlements will be the market value as prescribed by s HC 4(1B) of the ITA, unless excluded by s HC 4(2). 65. As noted in IS 18/01 Taxation of trusts – income tax: 8.83 Corpus requires a “settlement of property”. A “settlement of property” is not the same as a “transfer of value”. Some “transfers of value” do not result in the trust receiving “property”. One example is the provision of services. Although there is a transfer of value and, therefore, a settlement on the trust, there is not necessarily any property created by the provision of the services. Another example is the provision of an interest-free loan to a trust. Again, although there is a “transfer of value” and, therefore, a “settlement”, there is arguably no “property” settled on the trust. Although the trust as borrower enjoys an economic benefit from being able to enjoy the use of the loan principal for the term of the loan, this is arguably not a form of property in itself. This differs from the position that was accepted in argument by the Commissioner in Case Y25 (2008) 23 NZTC 13,270. 66. A settlement includes a settlement that the person is treated as making because the person is treated as a settlor; see s YA 1 of the ITA for the definition of settlor. 67. If there is a transfer of value (such as the provision of services at less than the market value) and therefore a settlement, but there is no property settled on the trust by that transfer of value that can be distributed, then the amount of the settlement returned under s 59BA(2)(b) will be nil. 68. Valuing such settlements as nil, there being no increase in the corpus, means there are no entries to the financial statements or statement of profit or loss and statement of financial position and, as noted, for the purposes of s 59BA(2)(b) the amount of the settlement is recorded as nil. 69. For the avoidance of doubt, this means: 69.1. A settlement has occurred so the “amount, and nature” must be disclosed under s 59BA(2)(b) even if the amount has been valued at nil. The details of the settlor must also be disclosed pursuant to section 59BA(2)(c). 69.2. There are no entries in the financial statements (OIC) or the statement of profit and loss and statement of financial position (s 59BA(2)(a)) as the amount of the settlement is nil and there is no change to the corpus. 70. Some settlements will be excluded from disclosure under s 59BA(2)(b)(i) as they are minor services incidental to the activities of the trust, or because, under s HC 27(2)(ab) of the ITA, providers of incidental services are not settlors in the first instance. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 27 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 71. Although for disclosure purposes such a settlement can be valued at nil, there may be other provisions within the Inland Revenue Acts that require recognition of these transactions if recorded at less than market value. 72. The nature of any settlement will be classified in the return under the following categories: 72.1. Cash 72.2. Financial arrangements 72.3. Land 72.4. Buildings 72.5. Shares/Ownership interests 72.6. Services (except those excluded under s 59BA(2)(b)(i), being the provision to the trustee, at less than market value, of minor services incidental to the activities of the trust) 72.7. Other (with a description provided). 73. The trustee will need to value land and buildings separately. This may be done by using the apportionment used in the most recent rating valuation under the Ratings Valuations Act 1998. 74. Section HC 4(1B) of the ITA requires that the value of the settlement is the market value at the time of the settlement. For land, this may include, as a proxy for the market value, the most recent rating valuation under the Rating Valuations Act 1998. 75. This information is required to be disclosed for any settlements made from the 2021-22 income year onwards (unless otherwise required under s 59BAB). 76. Examples in the return of “Other” types of settlements include settlements of asset types not specifically listed, and the provision of low/no interest loans from a settlor to the trust. 77. The Commissioner does not require the individual amounts and nature of each settlement but requires the annual amount of settlements in each category in the return. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 28 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 4 – settlement of non-cash assets on a trust John Smith owns a residential rental property and decides he would like to move the ownership of this asset to a trust structure. John has owned the property since before the introduction of the Brightline property rules. John establishes the John Smith Trust and gifts the property to the trust. This gift is considered a settlement. The original cost price of the property to John was $450,000. The tax value is also $450,000 because the property has not been depreciated. The market value, using the most recent rating valuation as a proxy, is $780,000. The s HC 4(1B) value of the settlement is $780,000, this is the amount that must be included as the corpus of the trust in the financial statements and statement of financial position, notwithstanding the fact that the OIC may allow for alternative valuation methodologies to be used. The value of the property needs to be split between land and buildings. The trustees can use the apportionment used in the rating valuation to apportion the amount. In this instance the rating valuation allocated a 60:40 split between land and improvements. Recognition: The trustee will record the following in the financial statements and statement of financial position: DR Asset: Land $468,000 DR Asset Buildings $312,000 CR Equity: Trust Corpus $780,000 Disclosure: • Amount of the settlement: $468,000 • Nature of the settlement: Land • Amount of the settlement: $312,000 • Nature of the settlement: Buildings \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 29 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Minor Services 78. A settlor of a trust is a person, who at any time, provides, for less than market value, services to the trust or for the benefit of the trust that are more than incidental to the operation of the trust; see s HC 27(2)(ab) of the ITA. 79. The provision of minor services incidental to the activities of the trust does not need to be disclosed as a settlement; see s 59BA(2)(b)(i). The services must be both minor services and incidental to the operation of the trust. Examples of services that are incidental to the operation of a trust include attending trust meetings and reviewing trust documents. An example of a service that is not incidental to the operation of a trust is the day-to-day management of a business carried on through a trust. 80. For further information see \[2.45\] -\[ 2.50\] in IS 18/01 Taxation of trusts – income tax. Interest not paid to beneficiary who is owed an amount may be a settlement 81. Any beneficiary who is owed an amount by the trust, including a beneficiary account, that exceeds $25,000 at the end of an income year and is not paid interest at the prescribed or market rate becomes a settlor of the trust pursuant to ss HC 27(2)(bb) and HC 27(6) of the ITA: HC 27 Who is a settlor? ... Meaning of settlor (2) A settlor of a trust is a person who, at any time, - ... (bb) is a beneficiary of the trust who is owed money by the trustee and does not meet the criteria of subsection (6): ... ... Beneficiaries owed money by trustees (6) When a trustee of a trust owes an amount to a beneficiary of the trust, the beneficiary does not become a settlor of the trust under subsection (2) solely as a result of being owed the amount if— (a) the amount owing at the end of the income year is not more than $25,000: \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 30 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (b) the amount owing at the end of the income year is more than $25,000 and the trustee pays to the beneficiary, for each income year in which the amount is owing and by the date given for the income year by section HC 6(1B), interest on the amount at a rate equal to the prescribed rate of interest or the market rate. 82. For the purposes of the financial statements and the statement of financial position, there is no change to the net assets of the trust as a result of such a transaction. There is a settlement but there is no property settled on the trust that can be distributed. 83. For the purpose of s 59BA(2)(b), a trustee will be required to disclose the details of the settlor and the nature of the settlement, however the amount of the settlement will be recorded as nil. 84. If a trustee of a trust owes a beneficiary: 84.1. less than $25,000, or 84.2. more than $25,000 but pays interest at a rate equal to the prescribed rate or market rate the beneficiary is not a settlor and there is no information to disclose under s 59BA(2)(b). The prescribed rate of interest is defined in s YA 1 of the ITA. Example 5 – beneficiary current account exceeds $25,000 The Trevor Tan Trust makes a $50,000 distribution to Timmy Tan during the 2021/22 tax year. The amount is credited to Timmy’s beneficiary account, but he has not withdrawn the funds from the Trust. Disclosure: Distribution nature & amount, and details of the beneficiary The trust will disclose the nature and amount of the distribution, along with Timmy’s details (name, date of birth, tax file number and jurisdiction of tax residency). Recognition: Movements in trust capital & beneficiary account The trust will record the transaction as a movement in both the trust capital and beneficiary accounts as follows: Dr Trust capital – distribution CR Beneficiary account – distribution \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 31 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] As there are no other transactions against Timmy’s beneficiary account for the year the closing balance will be $50,000. Disclosure: Settlement nature & amount, and details of the settlor As Timmy is owed more than $25,000 at the end of the year and no interest was paid by the trust on the amount, he is has made a settlement. The trustee will disclose: • Timmy’s details (name, date of birth, jurisdiction of tax residency and TFN/TIN); • The nature of the settlement (using the category “Other – interest not charged”); • The amount of the settlement will be recorded as nil. No transaction will need to be recognised against the Trust Corpus in the financial statement of the trust. 85. Pursuant to s HC 14(2B) of the ITA if a trustee pays interest to a beneficiary on an amount owed to the beneficiary, the payment is not a distribution by the trustee except to the extent to which the interest exceeds the amount given by the rate that is the greater of the market rate and the prescribed rate of interest. Example 6 – beneficiary paid interest in excess of market rate For the 2022/23 tax year the Trevor Tan Trust owes its beneficiary, Timmy Tan $50,000. The trust pays Timmy interest on the balance at a rate of 8%. The market rate of interest for the year was 5%. The $4,000 of interest was paid in cash to Timmy during the year. There are no other transactions against Timmy’s beneficiary account for the year. Application of section HC 14(2B): As the trust has paid interest at a rate higher than the applicable market rate, the excess over the market rate is treated as a distribution Actual interest paid @ 8% $4,000 Market rate of interest @ 5% $2,500 Deemed distribution amount $1,500 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 32 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Recognition: The trust will record the interest amount as an expense (whether or not the interest is deductible will be subject to the usual deductibility tests). The amount of interest that exceeds the applicable market rate is treated as a distribution. CR Cash/Bank $4,000 DR Interest expense $2,500 DR Trustee income/Trust Corpus/Trust Capital $1,500 CR Beneficiary account (distribution) $1,500 DR Beneficiary account (drawings) $1,500 Disclosure: Distribution nature and amount, and details of the beneficiary The trust will disclose the nature and amount of the distribution ($1,500), along with Timmy’s details (name, date of birth, jurisdiction of tax residency and TFN/TIN). As there are no other transactions against Timmy’s beneficiary account for the year the closing balance will be $50,000. 59BA(2)(c) Settlor details 86. Section YA 1 of the ITA defines a “settlor” as being defined in s HC 27 of the ITA: HC 27 Who is a settlor? ... Meaning of settlor (2) A settlor of a trust is a person who, at any time,- (a) transfers value— (i) to the trust; or (ii) for the benefit of the trust; or (iii) on terms of the trust: (ab) provides, for less than market value, services to the trust or for the benefit of the trust that are more than incidental to the operation of the trust: \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 33 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (b) provides financial assistance to the trust or for the benefit of the trust with an obligation to pay on demand, and the right to demand is not exercised or is deferred: (bb) is a beneficiary of the trust who is owed money by the trustee and does not meet the requirements of subsection (6): (c) is treated as a settlor under section HC 28. 87. The definition of settlor in s YA 1 of the ITA is slightly modified when it relates to minor beneficiaries (ss HC 36 and 37 of the ITA) and for certain associated persons tests (s YB 10 of the ITA defines a settlor for the purposes of ss YB 7 to YB 9 of the ITA). 88. For every settlor of the trust the trustee will be required to disclose: 88.1. Name of the settlor 88.2. Date of birth / commencement date of the settlor 88.3. Jurisdiction of tax residence of the settlor 88.4. Tax File Number or Taxpayer Identification Number of the settlor. 89. If the settlor is a natural person, the date of birth is required. If the settlor is a company or another trust, then the “date of birth” is the incorporation date of the company or the initial settlement date of the trust; this is referred to as the “commencement date” of the settlor. 90. The Tax File Number (TFN) is the identification number that the Commissioner allocates to a person; see definition in s 3. The Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), for a person in a jurisdiction other than New Zealand, is the functional equivalent of the person’s tax file number in that jurisdiction; see definition in s 3. 91. This information is required to be disclosed for each settlor: 91.1. who makes a settlement on the trust during the income year, from the 2021-22 income year onwards, or 91.2. whose details have not previously been supplied to the Commissioner. 92. A trustee is required to disclose the four items listed at \[88\] for each settlor who makes a settlement on a trust during the 2021-22 income year or future income \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 34 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] years. This means that if a trustee files a return under s 59BA for an income year, the four items listed at \[88\] will need to be included for all settlors in that income year. 93. A trustee is required to disclose the four items listed at \[88\] for each settlor whose details have not been previously provided to the Commissioner. This will include settlors prior to the 2021-22 income year and settlors in an income year where the trustee is not required to file the further information with a return under s 59BA(2). This means that any settlors in an income year for which the trustee does not file a s 59BA return (including years prior to 2021-22) will need to be included in the next return that the trustee files. Example 7 – details of settlors Socks and Boots Trust was settled by Lane Boots and Kane Socks in 2000 for the purpose of running a clothing shop. In January 2022, Jane Socks transfers a car to the trust for use in the business. For the 2021–22 income year, the trustee of Socks and Boots Trust must provide the details of Jane Socks as a settlor in the current income year, and also the details of Lane Boots and Kane Socks as settlors whose details have not previously been provided to the Commissioner. The trustee must also provide details on the amount and nature of the settlement Jane Socks made in the 2021–22 year. Initial disclosure of historical settlors 94. Inland Revenue acknowledges that some trusts may have been in existence for many years, the trustees may have changed over time or sufficient records have not been retained to determine all the settlors (or “deemed” settlors) of the trust. 95. However, where a settlement has occurred prior to 2020-21, including “deemed” settlements, the details of the settlor must still be disclosed if they have not previously been provided to the Commissioner. 96. In recognition of the practicalities of making the disclosure of these historical settlors, Inland Revenue only expects trustees to disclose details based on the records held of those settlors. If, for example, they hold the name of a settlor but none of the other required details and that information cannot be reasonably obtained, then disclosure of the name will be sufficient. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 35 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 97. For any settlement in the 2021-22 year or later years, the trustee will be expected to make a full disclosure of the amount and nature of settlements and the full details of those settlors (name, date of birth, jurisdiction of tax residence and TFN/TIN). Disclosure of settlor details when settlement made in a year where there is no assessable income 98. If a settlement on the trust is made in a year in which a trustee does not derive assessable income (and therefore does not have to file a return), or the trustee is excluded by s 59BA(3) from providing the s 59BA(2) information, the trustee will be required to provide the details of the settlor when the trustee files the next return. 99. This means, for example, that if a trustee does not have to file a return for the 2021- 22 year, they will be expected to provide the details of any settlors in that year if and when they next file a return in a future year. 59BA(2)(d) Distributions and details of beneficiaries 100. A “distribution” is defined in s HC 14 as being a transfer of value by a trustee to a person because the person is a beneficiary of the trust. A distribution is made when what is transferred vests absolutely in interest of the person or is paid to the person. HC 14 Distributions from trusts Transfers of value (1) A trustee makes a distribution when the trustee transfers value to a person because the person is a beneficiary of the trust. Transfers to other trusts included (2) Despite subsection (1), a settlement for the benefit of a beneficiary is treated as a transfer of value only— (a) if the amount or the property being settled would have been beneficiary income of, or a taxable distribution to, a beneficiary, had it been distributed at the time to a beneficiary resident in New Zealand; or (b) when sections EW 50 or EZ 39 (which relate to forgiveness of debt) applies, if the property being settled is an amount forgiven and treated as paid as described in section EW 44(1) or (2) (Consideration when debt forgiven for natural love and affection) or EZ 39(1). \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 36 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Payment of interest at rate above market rate not distribution (2B) If a trustee pays to a beneficiary interest on an amount owed to the beneficiary, the payment is not a distribution by the trustee except to the extent to which the interest exceeds the amount given by the rate that is the greater of the market rate and the prescribed rate of interest. When distribution made (3) A distribution is made when what is transferred— (a) vests absolutely in interest in the person; or (b) is paid to the person. Manner of distribution (4) A distribution may be made directly or indirectly, or by 1 transaction or a number of transactions, whether related, connected, or otherwise. Nil value of beneficiary relationship (5) The fact that a person is, or will become, a beneficiary of a trust does not constitute the giving or receiving of value. 101. For every beneficiary of the trust w ho receives a distribution from the trust during the income year, from the 2021-22 income year onwards, the trustee will be required to disclose: 101.1. The amount, and nature, of the distribution 101.2. Name of the beneficiary 101.3. Date of birth / commencement date of the beneficiary 101.4. Tax jurisdiction of the beneficiary 101.5. TFN or TIN of the beneficiary 102. Distributions, other than of money, that are minor and incidental to the activities of the trust do not need to be disclosed. 103. The disclosure of distributions and details of recipient beneficiaries will be captured on the IR6B Estate or trust beneficiary details. The IR6B will also capture all movements in beneficiary accounts (discussed at \[59\] to \[61\]. 104. Any beneficiary income allocated to the income year in the period after the income year as allowed by s HC 6 (1)(b) of the ITA is not a distribution in the income year, it \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 37 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] is a distribution in the following year. The distribution and the beneficiary income allocation will be recorded in different sections of the IR6B, and only those distributions in the income year will be returned in that income year’s return. 105. The amount of any non-cash distribution will be determined with reference to the tax value, historical cost or market value of the asset, the valuation methodology being determined by the trustees in accordance with the minimum standards for the financial statements required by the OIC. 106. In relation to non-cash distributions, such as the provision of services, interest free loans, or the use of assets by beneficiaries at no cost, a transfer of value, and therefore a distribution, has occurred. However, if there has been no reduction in the net assets of the trust, the trustees can choose to value the distribution as nil. 107. To meet the disclosure requirements of s 59BA(2)(d) the trustees must disclose the amount, and nature, of the distribution and the details of the beneficiary receiving that distribution. 108. If a distribution is made to more than one beneficiary jointly, then the distribution should be apportioned between the beneficiaries who receive it and the trustee needs to disclose the separate distributions. 109. This information is required to be disclosed for any distribution made from the 2021-22 income year onwards (unless otherwise required under s 59BAB). 110. If the beneficiary is a natural person, their date of birth is required. If the beneficiary is a company or another trust, the incorporation date of the company or the initial settlement date of the trust is required. This is referred to as the “commencement date” of the beneficiary. Example 8 – use of trust assets by a beneficiary The trustees of the John Smith Trust are required to file a return under s 59BA as they derive assessable income from the Trust’s rental property portfolio. Use of one of the properties is provided to Julie Smith, a beneficiary of the trust, at no cost. An equivalent property is rented to a third party for $600/week. The trustee can choose to use this market value as the basis for determining the amount of the beneficiary distribution, or they can value the distribution at nil as there has been no reduction in the net assets of the trust, either valuation methodology will meet the minimum standards for financial reporting. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 38 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] If the trustee choses to record the value of the provision of property at nil Recognition: There is no requirement to record anything in the financial statements and statement of financial position: Disclosure: • Amount of the distribution: $nil • Nature of the distribution: Use of trust property for less than market value • Details of the beneficiary If the trustee choses to record the value of the provision of property at market value Recognition: The trustee will record the following in the financial statements and statement of financial position and reflect the same as a movement in the beneficiary’s current account: DR Beneficiary Account: Distribution $31,200 CR Beneficiary Account: Drawings $31,200 The equivalent reduction in the beneficiary account recognises that the value of the benefit has been enjoyed by the beneficiary during the year. Disclosure: • Amount of the distribution: $31,200 • Nature of the distribution: Use of trust property for less than market value • Details of the beneficiary: Julie Smith Example 9 – debt forgiveness by a trustee to a beneficiary The trustees of the John Smith Trust are required to file a return under s 59BA as they derive assessable income from the Trust’s rental property portfolio. Some years ago, the Trust lent Craig Smith, a beneficiary of the trust, $200,000. Over time Craig has repaid some of the loan but as at 1 April 2021 the balance was $125,000. During the year the trustees decided to forgive this debt, so Craig no longer needs to repay it. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 39 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The forgiveness of the debt is a distribution to the beneficiary. Recognition: The trustees will have recorded the value of the loan in the financial statements and statement of financial position of the Trust under the category “Associated persons financial arrangements”. When the debt is forgiven: DR Beneficiary Account: Distribution $125,000 CR Associated persons financial arrangements $125,000 Disclosure: The trustees will disclose: • Amount of the distribution: $125,000 • Nature of the distribution: Forgiveness of debt • Details of the beneficiary: Craig Smith Minor beneficiaries 111. Allocations of beneficiary income that the minor beneficiary rule applies to are treated as trustee income, unless one of the exceptions apply; see s HC 35 of the ITA. HC 35 Beneficiary income of minors When this section applies (1) This section applies when a person who is a minor derives an amount of beneficiary income from a trust in an income year. Subsection (4) and sections HC 36 and HC 37 override this subsection. Treatment of amount derived (2) The amount is— (a) excluded income of the minor under section CX 58 (Amounts derived by minors from trusts): (b) treated as trustee income for the purposes of determining the rate of tax that applies, who pays the relevant tax, and who provides the return of income. Meaning of minor (3) For the purposes of this section, and sections HC 36, HC 37, LE 4, and LF 2 (which relate to the treatment of tax credits of beneficiary minors), a minor is \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 40 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] a natural person resident in New Zealand who is under 16 years of age on the trust’s balance date for the income year. Exclusions (4) This section does not apply— (a) if the total amount of beneficiary income that the minor derives from the trust in the income year is $1,000 or less; or (b) to beneficiary income derived— (i) from a trust settled in the way described in section HC 36: (ii) from a testamentary trust described in section HC 37: (iii) from a Maori authority: (iv) directly from a group investment fund: (v) by a person for whom a child disability allowance is paid under the Social Security Act 2018. Relationship with other provisions (5) This section overrides sections HC 5, HC 18 to HC 20, HC 22, HC 23, and HC 32. 112. For the purposes of recording the movements in beneficiary accounts of minors in the IR6B the following approach should be taken: 112.1. Allocations of beneficiary income to which the minor beneficiary rule does not apply should be recorded as “Beneficiary Income”. 112.2. Allocations of beneficiary income to which the minor beneficiary rule does apply should be recorded as “Distributions”. Example 10 – movements in beneficiary accounts of minors In the 2021-22 tax year the trustees in the Cathy Clarke Trust make a $10,000 distribution to each of the trusts’ three beneficiaries: Cathy Clarke, aged 42 William Clarke, aged 43 Claude Clarke, aged 12 The amounts are not paid out in cash but are credited to the respective beneficiaries’ current accounts. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 41 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Under s HC 35 Claude Clarke is a minor beneficiary so the minor beneficiary rule applies. Recognition: The trustee will record the following in the financial statements and statement of financial position, and reflect the same as movements in the beneficiaries’ current accounts: DR P&L: Trustee income $20,000 CR Equity: Beneficiary account – Distribution (Cathy) $10,000 CR Equity: Beneficiary account – Distribution (William) $10,000 DR Equity: Trust Capital $10,000 CR Equity: Beneficiary account – Distribution (Claude) $10,000 Disclosure: • Amount of the distribution: $10,000 • Nature of the distribution: Accounting income • Details of the recipient of the distribution – Cathy • Amount of the distribution: $10,000 • Nature of the distribution: Accounting income • Details of the recipient of the distribution - William • Amount of the distribution: $10,000 • Nature of the distribution: Accounting income • Details of the recipient of the distribution - Claude 59BA(2)(e) Persons with powers of appointment 113. Section 59BA(2)(e) requires the trustee, for every person who has a power under the trust to appoint or dismiss a trustee, add or remove a beneficiary or amend the trust deed (referred to as an “appointer”), to disclose: 113.1. Name of appointer 113.2. Date of birth / commencement date of appointer \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 42 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 113.3. Tax jurisdiction of appointer 113.4. TFN or TIN of appointer 114. This information is required to be disclosed for every person with any of the powers listed in s 59BA(2)(e). 115. If the appointer is a natural person, the date of birth is required. If the appointer is a company or another trust, the incorporation date of the company or the initial settlement date of the trust is required. This is referred to as the “commencement date” of the appointer. 116. If the trustee has previously disclosed the required details of an appointer, and that person retains the same power, the trustee does not need to disclose the details again. If the appointer’s details change in an income year, such as the tax jurisdiction of the appointer, the updated details will need to be disclosed. 59BA(2)(f) Other information required 117. The Commissioner may require a trustee to provide any other information required by the Commissioner. 59BA(3) Trusts excluded from the requirement to comply with s 59BA(2) 118. Section 59BA(3) prescribes a list of trustees who, although required to file a return under s 59BA(1), are not required to include the information set out in s 59BA(2) in their return. 119. A trustee who does not have to include the information in s 59BA(2) in their return because they are a trustee listed in s 59BA(3) also does not have to prepare the financial statements set out in the OIC. 120. Even if a trustee derives assessable income, if they have non-active complying trust status under s 43B, they do not have to file a return. 121. The effect of this is that: 121.1. A trustee who derives assessable income is required to file a return; s 59BA(1). 121.2. With that return, information has to be included; s 59BA(2). \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 43 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 121.3. However, if the trustee is one of the trustees listed in s 59BA(3), then the trustee does not have to provide the information required by s 59BA(2). They are still required to file a return though as they derive assessable income. 121.4. A trustee who does not have to include the information required by s 59BA(2) in their return does not have to prepare the financial statements required by the OIC. 121.5. As a non-active complying trust under s 43B does not have to file a return, a trustee of non-active complying trust does not have to file a return even if they derive assessable income. 59BA Annual return for trusts (1) ... (2) ... (3) A trustee of a trust who is required to file a return for a tax year under subsection (1) is not required to file a return in the form required by subsection (2) if— (a) the trustee is excluded from the requirement to make a return by section 43B (which relates to non-active trusts): (b) the trust is a foreign trust: (c) the trustees of the trust are incorporated as a board under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957: (d) the trust is a charitable trust registered under the Charities Act 2005: (e) the trustee is eligible under section HF 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to choose under section HF 11 of that Act to become a Maori authority: (f) the trust is a widely-held superannuation fund, as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007: (g) the trust is an employee share scheme that is an exempt ESS, as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007: (h) the trustee is a debt funding special purpose vehicle, as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007: (i) the trustee is a lines trust established under the Energy Companies Act 1992. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 44 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Foreign Trusts 122. Section 59BA(3)(b) excludes a trustee of a foreign trust from the requirement to comply with s 59BA(2). Foreign trust is defined in s HC 11 of the ITA as a trust that has not had a New Zealand resident settlor at any time since 17 December 1987. Trustees excluded from complying with s 59BA(2) as a result of s 59BA(3)(b) include: 122.1. A trustee required to make a return by s 59D (which relates to foreign trusts where one or more of the trustees of the trust are New Zealand tax residents). 122.2. A trustee of a foreign trust, with no trustees that are New Zealand tax residents, that derives New Zealand source income. 123. Dual status trusts satisfy the s HC 11 of the ITA definition of foreign trust, so also will not be required to comply with s 59BA(2). Dual status trusts are trusts that satisfy the requirements to be a complying trust from inception but have only non- resident settlors so are also a foreign trust. For further information on dual status trusts see \[8.47\] – \[8.51\] of IS 18/01 Taxation of trusts – income tax. Estates 124. IS 18/01 Taxation of Trusts – Income Tax (at \[9.25\]) clarifies that estates are not trusts: 124.1. The mere fact that a person has died, and an executor has been appointed to manage their estate, does not give rise to a trust relationship. Trustees and executors have different capacities (Re Hayes \[1971\] 1 WLR 758 (Ch)). 124.2. However, it will often be the case that a trust will be created by will (referred to as a testamentary trust). This can occur expressly by way of a statement in a will that specific property of the deceased will be held on trust for a named beneficiary. This could also occur where property is left for a minor beneficiary that needs to be held until the beneficiary is of age. 125. OS 21/03 Excusing estates from filing income tax returns sets out the Commissioner’s approach to determining when a trust will arise in the administration of a deceased estate: 6. ... A trust can, and often does, arise before an estate is fully administered but administration of the estate needs to have reached the stage of the property being held by someone with the special duties of a trustee. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 45 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 126. See also IS 19/04 Income Tax – Distributions from Foreign Trusts for further discussion on when a trust will arise in the administration of a deceased estate. 127. After the date that a trust arises in the administration of an estate, a trustee will be required to comply with s 59BA(2) if they have an obligation to file a return under s 59BA(1). However, if the trust has complying non-active status under s 43B, it will not be required to file a return. Notifying Inland Revenue of excluded status 128. Trustees that are required to file returns but qualify, under any of the paragraphs in s 59BA(3), to be excluded from providing the information required by s 59BA(2) will need to notify the Commissioner that they are excluded on the return filed each year. 129. Trustees that meet the exclusion under s 59BA(3)(a) (complying non-active trust) will not need to file a return so will not be required to notify the Commissioner that they are excluded under s 59BA(3)(a). 59BA(4) Persons responsible for performance 130. The obligation to comply with subsections 59BA(1) and (2) lies with a trustee of a trust. If there is more than one trustee, then the obligation to comply lies with each trustee individually but only one return is to be filed. 131. If there are trustees who are not New Zealand residents, then any New Zealand resident trustees are responsible for the performance of the obligations imposed by s 59BA. However, if no trustee is a New Zealand resident, then any settlor of the trust who is a New Zealand resident is responsible for ensuring the performance of the obligations imposed by s 59BA. 59BA Annual return for trusts (1) ... (2) ... (3) ... (4) If the trustee of a trust is a non-resident, a settlor of the trust who is a New Zealand resident is responsible for ensuring the performance of the obligations imposed on the trustee by this section. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 46 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 59BA(5) Variation to the requirements 132. Section 59BA(5) allows the Commissioner to vary the requirements in s 59BA(2) for a specific trustee or a class of trustees, and subsection 59BA(6) confirms that such a variation is secondary legislation. 133. Section 59BA(2) provides that a trustee required to file a return under s 59BA(1) and who does not meet the requirements of s 59BA(3) must provide the information required by s 59BA(2)(a) to (f) “unless otherwise required by the Commissioner”. If the Commissioner “otherwise require\[s\]” under s 59BA(2), this will be by variation under s 59BA(5). 59BA Annual return for trusts (1) ... (2) ... (3) ... (4) ... (5) The Commissioner may vary the requirements set out in subsection (2) for a trustee or class of trustees. (6) A variation under subsection (5) is secondary legislation (see Part 3 of the Legislation Act 2019 for publication requirements) 59BAB Retrospective collection 134. Section 59BAB allows for the retrospective collection of the same information required by s 59BA. 59BAB Commissioner may require trust information for period after 2013–14 income year (1) The Commissioner may require a trustee of a trust to provide, in the prescribed form and by the specified date, information that— (a) relates to the trust and a period beginning after the end of the 2013– 14 income year and ending before the beginning of the 2021–22 income year; and \[UNCLASSIFIED\] | 6 April 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 47 of 48 OS 22/02 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (b) would be required to be provided under section 59BA if the period began after the end of the 2020–21 income year; and (c) is in the knowledge, possession, or control of the trustee. (2) The Commissioner may issue a notice requiring the trustee of each trust having the characteristics specified in the notice to provide, in the prescribed form and by the specified date, information— (a) that is described in subsection (1) and is specified in the notice; and (b) is for each period that is specified in the notice and begins after the end of the 2013–14 income year and ends before the beginning of the 2021–22 income year. (3) If the trustee of a trust is a non-resident, a settlor of the trust who is a New Zealand resident is responsible for ensuring the performance of the obligations imposed on the trustee by this section. (4) A notice under subsection (2) is secondary legislation under the Legislation Act 2019. 135. The information may be requested for periods beginning after the end of the 2013- 14 year, i.e. from the 2014-15 income year onwards, which is seven years prior to the 2021-22 income year (being the first year of disclosure required under s 59BA(2)). 136. Section 22 requires records to be kept for a period of seven years after the end of the income year to which the records relate. Section 22B requires trustees to retain information about certain forgiveness of debt for as long as the trust exists. 137. If the Commissioner requests information under s 59BAB(1), only information that is in the knowledge, possession, or control of the trustee is required to be provided. 138. If the trustee of a trust is a non-resident, then a settlor who is a New Zealand resident is responsible for ensuring compliance with the obligations imposed on the trustee under s 59BAB. 139.

\[UNCLASSIFIED\] OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Authority to Act for Tax Agents and other Intermediaries and Nominated Persons Issued: 6 July 2022 OS 22/03 Operational statements set out the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s view of the law in respect of the matter discussed and deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This statement prescribes the manner by which a tax agent or a representative can obtain the authority to act from their clients. All legislative references in this Statement are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), unless specified otherwise. START DATE – This Statement applies from the date of issue OS 22/03 | 6 July 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Introduction This Statement prescribes the manner by which a tax agent or a representative can obtain the authority to act from their clients. Schedule 7, part B, clause 15 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) allows the Commissioner to make available sensitive revenue information to the agent of a taxpayer, where that taxpayer has authorised the agent in a manner as the Commissioner prescribes. A third-party provider, such as a tax agent or a representative, who obtains the authority to act from a client in accordance with this Statement is considered an agent of that client under Schedule 7, part B, clause 15. As an agent, the tax agent or representative must hold authority from their client in order to link to the client’s accounts and to give the agent or the agency the legal permission to deal with Inland Revenue on their client’s behalf. The authority to act can either be in a written form or in electronic form. Linking to a client means the agent will be granted direct online access to their client’s tax accounts for which they have authority to act, where they will have the ability to view and update a client’s records and information. It is, therefore, important for Inland Revenue to ensure that a tax agent or representative has obtained proper authorisation for that access. This Statement sets out information about:  who may give an authority to act;  what the authority to act should cover;  the requirements for obtaining authority to act electronically;  the requirement to keep a record of the client’s authority and identity verification documents; and  Inland Revenue’s process for auditing these documents. Application of the statement 1. This Statement applies from 6 July 2022. OS 22/ 03 | 6 July 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2. The guidelines apply to:  third-p arty providers who are listed as a tax agent under s 124C; and  persons who have been approved as a representative under s 124D; and  persons nominated to act on behalf of another in relation to the first person’s tax affairs or social policy entitlements and obligation under s 124F. These people will collectively be referred to as “intermediaries” or “nominated persons” in these guidelines. 3. New clients and any existing clients of an intermediary requiring a new authority to act on or after the application date should follow the requirements in these guidelines. 4. These Operational Guidelines replace the IR1059: Authority to Act guidelines for intermediaries, as well as Pages 2-3 of the IR1025: Correspondence guidelines and finally, the ‘Process for tax agents to obtain electronic authorities to act’, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23 No 9 November 2011. Discussion Who can give Authority to Act Individuals 5. An authority to act must be obtained from the person to whom the information belongs. 6. An authority to act for an individual does not extend to that person’s related entities, for example a company of which the client is a shareholder/director. If an intermediary is acting for their client’s personal tax affairs as well as the affairs of their related entities and obtaining authorities to act at the same time, they may use a single authority to act for all entities. All of the entities and their respective IRD numbers that the authority is intended to apply to must be clearly listed in the authority to act. If it is not clearly listed, then separate authorities to act will be required for each entity. OS 22/03 | 6 July 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Non-individuals 7. An authority to act for a non-individual must be provided by a person or persons with the requisite authority to bind that non-individual.  Companies: A person or persons who hold(s) the authority to bind the company to an agreement must provide the authority to act. This would normally be a director or a manager.  Ordinary partnerships: The authority to act must be signed by a partner or by a person who has the delegated authority to bind the partnership.  Limited partnerships: The authority to act must be signed by a general partner or a person who has the delegated authority to bind the limited partnership.  Trusts: The authority to act must be signed by all trustees, or by the trustee or trustees who have been authorised by the other trustees to act on all of their behalf.  All other entities: A person or persons with the requisite authority must sign the authority to act. 8. The rules governing the particular entity will determine how many persons need to sign the authority to act. For example, if one person holds the delegated authority to sign on behalf of the other members of the non-individual then only that person needs to sign. The person signing the authority to act must ensure that they are authorised by the non-individual to appoint the intermediary. 9. Where there has been a change to the ownership of a non-individual entity such that the person who provided the original authority can no longer bind that entity a new authority to act should be provided. (Note: Where there has been no change in ownership, a new authority to act would not be necessary merely because the person who signed an authority leaves that entity.) Children under 16 10. Children under the age of 16 need a parent or guardian to complete the authority to act on their behalf. When a child of an existing client turns 16 and they become a client, the child will need to complete their own authority to act. OS 22/03 | 6 July 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Incapacitated persons 11. Incapacitated or cognitively impaired customers, including children, receiving income, often from ACC to employ carers, will have tax obligations. These obligations can be met by a parent or guardian who has been given the appropriate authority to act. 12. However, if that nominated person subsequently dies or is otherwise incapacitated the process for providing an alternative authorised person with the necessary authority to act may not always be straight-forward. This is because the incapacitated customer may lack the legal capacity to nominate another person under s 124F. 13. Often the death or incapacity of an authorised parent or guardian will result in an “automatically” appointed guardian for the incapacitated customer with whom IR can liaise with regarding the customer’s tax affairs (or who may affirm the continuing role of a nominated agent). However, in limited circumstances this will not occur. 14. In those limited circumstances the court will appoint a guardian (or take guardianship itself). Thereafter the IR should address itself to whomever the court has appointed (who may affirm the continuing role of a nominated person). 15. To the extent there is a period between the death or incapacity of a sole guardian and the appointment of another guardian for a child, during that period the IR should liaise with the person taking responsibility for the day-to-day care of the child. This would not breach the confidentiality obligations on IR. 16. There may be a gap between the death or incapacity of a parent or guardian and the appointment of a new guardian. For example, where:  there is a sole parent or guardian who dies without naming a testamentary guardian; or 1  where the parent/guardian is incapacitated to such an extent they can no longer fulfil their obligations, but the testamentary guardian does not take the role. 2 17. In such situations the court will appoint a guardian or become the guardian itself (most likely using an agent of the court). However, this does not happen automatically 1 Or where both parents/guardians die at the same time or in close proximity. 2 It is assumed the guardian has not prepared an enduring power of attorney dealing with the guardianship. OS 22/03 | 6 July 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] without the intervention of the court and the process may take some time. In the meantime, the customer will continue to have tax obligations to meet. 18. Upon getting an application for guardianship the court may make an order for an interim agent of the court to act on its behalf in guardianship matters in order that the court can then consider a more permanent solution. That person or agency will be a de facto guardian until guardianship can be legally resolved. For IR this means that there is a person to deal with in respect of the incapacitated person’s tax affairs. 19. This means that in the limited circumstances:  where a sole guardian dies or is incapacitated; and  there is no ‘replacement guardian’ (appointed as testamentary guardian or under an enduring power of attorney); and  the Court has not yet appointed a guardian or an agent of the Court (where the court itself is the guardian); then  Inland Revenue will adopt a pragmatic approach and deal with the person who is fulfilling the duties of a de facto guardian and parent. 20. In the above circumstances, Inland Revenue is prepared to recognise the practical realities of the circumstances and recognise that the person is acting with apparent authority in a situation where no other person has actual authority. This will mean getting that person to deal with the tax issues or to appoint or affirm a nominated person Inland Revenue can deal with. Because Inland Revenue is liaising with the de facto guardian to carry into effect the revenue law, this would be a permitted disclosure of sensitive revenue information under s 18D. Deceased persons 21. If a client passes away, the intermediary must obtain a new authority to act from an authorised person for the estate, such as the administrator or executor. Deceased intermediary 22. If an intermediary who holds an authority to act on behalf of a client, passes away, that authority to act will end with the intermediary’s death if the authority is given to a specified intermediary. On the other hand, where the authority to act is given to an OS 22/03 | 6 July 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] intermediary’s business or partnership, which will continue after the death of one of the intermediaries, it is likely that the existing authority to act will continue. Verifying the identity of the person giving authority 23. The identity of the person providing the authority to act must be established to a high degree of confidence to ensure that they are entitled to provide that authority. That is, the intermediary must be satisfied that the information they are authorised to access belongs to that person or that the person can authorise access of information on behalf of a non-individual (for example a director/shareholder of a company). 24. It may sometimes, depending on the circumstances, be prudent for an intermediary to check that they have been properly appointed. An intermediary may wish to verify a signatory’s authority as part of the identity verification process, for example, by obtaining and holding a copy of the trustee resolution that gives authority to a particular trustee to act on behalf of the other trustees. Information needed on the authority to act 25. For Inland Revenue to be satisfied that sufficient authority to act has been obtained, the following must be clearly addressed in the authority:  The client’s full name and IRD number.  The authority to act must be dated and signed by the client.  Where the client is a non-individual entity, the name and the position of each signatory in the non-individual entity must be clearly stated.  The full name of the intermediary.  Where the intermediary is in the name of an individual, the authority should also include the words “and staff or contractors”, as applicable.  The tax accounts the intermediary will be acting on behalf of the client for or state “ALL” if the client gives authority to act for ALL tax accounts. (Note: a tax account can include student loan and social policy entitlements, however an intermediary cannot link to Child Support, Paid Parental Leave or KiwiSaver accounts). OS 22/03 | 6 July 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  Authorise the intermediary to obtain the client's information from Inland Revenue through all channels, including Inland Revenue’s online services. 26. If applicable, the authority to act should also:  Authorise the intermediary to sign tax returns on behalf of the client.  Specify the time for which the authority to act endures. If no timeframe is specified, then the authority will apply until it is terminated.  Specify how and when the authority to act can be terminated by either party.  State that authority is given for any refunds and other credits to be released to the intermediary’s trust account.  Authorise the intermediary to adjust, correct and finalise the client’s pre-populated or final account.  State whether the intermediary or the client is responsible for checking the correctness of the pre-populated or final account. 27. The authority to act must also make clear that if a client has been delinked or the nature of an existing authority changes for any reason, a new authority to act needs to be obtained before the intermediary can re-link and access the client’s information. 28. Examples of circumstances a new authority to act is required for existing clients are:  The client requires the intermediary to act for a tax type that was not originally authorised for.  Client engages the services of another intermediary and unknowingly ceases the old intermediary’s authority. 29. An intermediary may also want to ensure that a client understands that linking to a tax account will allow the intermediary to have full access to the information held by Inland Revenue, and may have the ability to modify client details, relating to the tax accounts they are linked to. 30. Please note: A client’s agreement to the intermediary’s terms and conditions or contract may not necessarily mean the client has given authority to act for Inland Revenue’s purposes. The authority to act clauses must be explicit in the agreement or agreed to separately. OS 22/03 | 6 July 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Group of taxpayers 31. Where a group of related taxpayers are onboarded at the same time, Inland Revenue will accept one authority to act document for all of the related taxpayers, only if the following additional requirements are complied with:  The name and IRD number of the individual and/or entities are clearly listed in the authority to act document.  The authority to act is signed by all applicable individuals and persons with the requisite authority to bind the non-individual entities.  The positions of the signatories in the non-individual entities must be clearly stated. 32. Any new related entities or individuals that the intermediary will act for in the future will require a new authority to act and cannot be retrospectively added to an existing authority. Onboarding clients electronically 33. With many businesses conducting more of their services online, an intermediary may choose to onboard clients electronically, without meeting a client face to face. 34. The information requirements for an authority to act in \[25\]-\[32\] may be met electronically, such as using an online electronic platform, provided that all required information is clearly set out in the electronic authority to act and that the authority to act is readily accessible for review when requested by Inland Revenue. 35. It is important that new clients are aware and understand what they are authorising the intermediary to do. To that end, an intermediary may choose to adopt a “tick box” approach to ensure that the clauses of the authorisation are read and explicitly agreed to. 36. Where this approach is used, the intermediary must make clear as a minimum all the following points for Inland Revenue to be satisfied that sufficient authority to act has been obtained. The authority to act must: OS 22/03 | 6 July 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  authorise the intermediary to obtain the client’s information from Inland Revenue through all channels, including IR’s online services;  state the name of the tax agency and/or individual intermediary’s name, plus whether staff or contractors may be acting on behalf of the client;  state what tax accounts the intermediary will be undertaking on behalf of the client (the online intermediary may wish to specify “ALL” tax accounts to ensure full understanding of the client’s tax position);  specify the time for which the authority to act endures and how and when the authority to act can be terminated by either party;  state to the client that linking allows the intermediary to have full access to information held by Inland Revenue and ability to modify client details relating to the tax accounts they are linked for;  state where correspondence for linked tax accounts will be directed, either to the online intermediary or the client;  state that authority is given for any refund credits to be transferred to the agency’s trust account prior to refund to the client (if applicable);  authorise the online intermediary to prepare, submit and sign tax returns on behalf of the client. Each point above must have its own “tick box” so the client is fully aware of the agreement they are entering into when authorising authority to act to the intermediary. The authority to act points must be agreed to separately from the online intermediary’s terms and conditions or contract agreement. A copy of the client’s authority to act must be held on file along with the verification of identity. Electronic signature 37. Inland Revenue will accept an electronic signature on an authority to act obtained electronically if the electronic signature meets the following requirements:  the electronic signature must adequately identify the signatory and adequately indicates the agreement to the authority to act; OS 22/03 | 6 July 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  the means of creating the electronic signature must be linked to the signatory and to no other person;  the means of creating the electronic signature was under the control of the signatory and of no other person; and  any alternation to the authority to act or to the electronic signature after the time of signing must be detectable. Process for verifying the identity of the person giving authority when onboarding electronically 38. When the onboarding process is done entirely online, it is important that the identity of the person giving authority is verified. Inland Revenue must be satisfied that the information to be accessed belongs to the person giving the authority, or that the person can authorise access of information on behalf of a non-individual (for example, a director of a company). 39. Inland Revenue acknowledges that many of the intermediaries will already have identity verification obligations under the Anti Money-Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 (AML-CFT Act). Inland Revenue will accept the identity of the person providing the authority will have been established to a high degree of confidence where the intermediary has completed the customer due diligence in accordance with their obligations under the AML-CFT Act. 40. If an intermediary that does not have due diligence obligations under the AML-CFT Act then they must follow the process set out below in \[41\]–\[ 51\] to verify the identity of their client. Use of online identity verification provider 41. An intermediary should use an online electronic identity verification provider to verify the identity of a client. The identity verification provider must be reliable and independent and compliant with the AML-CFT identity verification requirements. 42. If an online identity verification provider does not meet the AML-CFT Act requirements (because the intermediary does not have due diligence obligations under the AML-CFT Act), the provider used must be reputable and be authorised to verify at least five OS 22/ 03 | 6 July 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] points from a current New Zealand driver's licence or a current New Zealand passport. They must also be able to confirm that the driver's licence/passport is a valid one and has not been reported stolen or cancelled. The points for verification must include: Driver’s licence NZ Passport First name Fir st name Middle name (if given) Middle name (if given) Last name Last name Driver’s licence number Passport number Version number Expiry date 43. For the identity to be accepted as verified, all five points must match. The third-party verifier is required to send the intermediary a confirmation report advising whether verification has been successful. The confirmation report must state accepted or rejected next to each key point and include the name of the third-party verifier, and the time and date the verification report was requested and completed. 44. The confirmation report is to be held on file by the intermediary as verification of the client’s identity. The intermediary must be able to provide a hard copy of the verification report at the request of the Commissioner. 45. Where a confirmation report comes back as unsuccessful, a second attempt may be made. If in the second instance a confirmation report comes back as unsuccessful, the intermediary must then request and keep a copy of the client's photo ID. 46. As the intermediary does not receive an actual copy of the client's photo identification using this process, a bank account match must also be completed. The client must provide the intermediary with a bank account under the name submitted as part of the identity verification. Joint bank accounts are acceptable, where the joint account name includes that provided during the verification process. Details of bank account name and number must be held on file alongside the verification report of client identity. The process of bank account matching reduces the risk of identity fraud. OS 22/ 03 | 6 July 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 47. The following are acceptable forms of photo ID:  New Zealand passport.  New Zealand driver’s licence.  Overseas passport issued by a foreign government.  New Zealand certificate of identity (issued by Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment or Department of Internal Affairs).  New Zealand firearms licence or dealer’s licence.  New Zealand 18+ card or Kiwi Access card.  International Drivers’ Permit (issued by a member country of the UN Convention on Road Traffic). 48. If the client is a child under 16 years of age, the child's parent or guardian is required to provide the following documentation:  proof of their own identity as parent or guardian by providing one legible copy of an identity document which must contain a photo as listed in paragraph 47, plus either o The child’s New Zealand full birth certificate or overseas birth certificate, or o a legible copy of a document which shows the relationship between them and the child, such as a birth certificate or adoption papers. Requirement to keep record of the client’s authority to act and identity document 49. The intermediary must keep a copy of the client’s authority to act and identity document. 50. Client authorities to act that are obtained electronically must be kept in a manner that allows Inland Revenue to readily access and review that authority and the identification documents of the person who provided the authority. 51. Please refer to Standard Practice Statement SPS 21/0 2: Retention of business records in electronic format, application to store records offshore and application to keep records in La nguages other than English or te reo Māori (or any subsequent replacement) for the standards to which records must be kept. OS 22/03 | 6 July 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 13 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Consequence of not obtaining sufficient authority to act 52. The authority received by the intermediary must be adequate for them to act for the client’s tax affairs and social policy entitlements and to receive information held by Inland Revenue (for example, if the intermediary is dealing with the client’s PAYE then the client’s authority must cover PAYE). 53. Not obtaining sufficient authority to act means that the intermediary is unable to receive the client’s information from Inland Revenue. 54. Accessing a client’s information without authority or in breach of the authority could result in the removal of the intermediary from the list of tax agents or the cancellation of the intermediary’s representative status. Inland Revenue may audit authority to act documents 55. From time to time, Inland Revenue will ask to view a sample of the authorities to act from an intermediary to ensure the requirements set out in these guidelines are met. Samples will be selected at random. 56. Part of this review may include viewing samples of the identity documents held and to ensure that reasonable checks have been undertaken to establish the identity of the person giving authority, as well as checking if an electronic signature had been submitted in accordance with these guidelines. 57. If an authority to act is held by an intermediary but does not meet the requirements of these guidelines, adequate time will be given to the intermediary to correct this. However, if no authority to act is held for a client at all, that client will be delinked.

OS 22/04 - Part 1 FS | 10 October 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] What is a charity There is no legislative definition of a “charity” in the ITA or Charities Act. Common law has established the hallmarks of a charity. Related terms defined legislatively include: “charitable entity” (aka “registered charity”), “charitable organisation”, “donee organisation” and “tax charity” described in the Key terms section below. Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between the overlapping definitions. For a more detailed discussion of what is a charity, see \[13\] – \[23\]. Key terms and tax treatments charity Not defined in the ITA or Charities Act, but common law has established the hallmarks of a charity are that: • the purpose of the charity is for the public benefit; and • the purpose is charitable charitable entity (referred to as a “registered charity”) Defined in the Charities Act: • a society, institution or the trustee of a trust • that is registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act May be entitled to: • RWT-exemption; and/or • donee organisation status charitable organisation Defined in the ITA s YA 1, for a quarter or an income year: • an association, fund, institution, organisation, society or trust; o that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual; and o whose funds are applied wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand; or May be entitled to: • FBT exclusion; • GST concessions; and/or • interest-free student loans for volunteers.

These tax benefits are subject to maximum limits (the taxable OS 22/04 - Part 1 FS | 10 October 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] tertiary education institutions, funds,\* and public funds\*; • an entity approved by Parliament and listed in schedule 32 (Recipients of charitable or other public benefit gifts ) • an entity that no longer meets the requirements of donee organisation because it is removed from the charities register (for a limited time while appeal is pending) \* these entities must be a registered charity, if eligible income of the individual, company or Māori authorities). Figure 1: Relationship between overlapping definitions in the ITA and Charities Act Charitable purposes For a society or institution to be a charity, it must be established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes. For a trust to be a charity, its income must be derived by the trustees in trust for charitable purposes. OS 22/04 - Part 1 FS | 10 October 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The definitions of “charitable purpose” in s YA 1 of the ITA and s 5 of the Charities Act are materially the same and provide that charitable purpose includes “every charitable purpose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community”. A charity’s purpose or purposes must be of public benefit within the sense the law recognises as charitable. For a more detailed discussion of charitable purposes, see \[37\] – \[43\]. Tax treatment available to charities Tax treatment available may include income tax exemption, RWT exemption, FBT exclusion and GST concessions, while some overseas entities’ volunteers’ student loans may be eligible to remain interest-free. Also, donee organisation tax treatment may be available. With regard to the income tax exemptions for business and non-business income of a tax charity, see the attached flowchart. For a more detailed discussion of the variety of tax treatments available to charities, see \[44\] – \[172\]. Implications of ceasing to be a tax charity or deregistration A charity ceases to be a tax charity when it no longer meets the requirements in the definition of tax charity in the ITA. A charity is deregistered when it is removed from the register held by Charities Services. A charity that has ceased to be a tax charity or been deregistered needs to determine whether any new tax obligations apply and from what date, for example income tax obligations, RWT-exemption, FBT-exclusion and donee organisation status may all be affected if the charity ceases to be a tax charity or is deregistered. Additionally, a charity may be subject to a “deregistration tax” when it ceases to be a tax charity or is deregistered.

For charities that have donee status, donors may receive favourable tax treatments such as donation tax credits, payroll giving tax credits and income tax gift deductions. Operational Statement Charities and donee organisations: Part 2 Donee organisations explains the types of entity that can become a donee organisation, including registered charities, entities requiring the Commissioners approval as a donee organisation, donee organisations by definition and donee organisations approved by Parliament. It also describes the tax benefits of being a donee organisation including tax credits and gift deductions for charitable or other public benefit gifts made by donors and FBT concessions.

An organisation that meets the definition of donee organisation is referred to as having “donee status”. For a more detailed discussion of what is a donee organisation and donee status, see \[10\] – \[13\]. Key terms donee organisation Defined in ss YA 1 and LD 3(2) (Meaning of charitable or other public benefit gift): • a society\*, institution\*, association\*, organisation\*, or trust\*; o that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual; o whose funds are applied wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand; • certain community housing entities, public institutions\*, boards constituted under the Education and Training Act 2020, tertiary education institutions, funds,\* and public funds\*; • an entity approved by Parliament and listed in schedule 32 (Recipients of charitable or other public benefit gifts ) • an entity that no longer meets the requirements of donee organisation because it is removed from the charities register (for a limited time while appeal is pending) \* these entities must be a registered charity, if eligible donee status The status of an organisation that meets the definition of donee organisation charity Not defined in the ITA or Charities Act, but common law has established the hallmarks of a charity are that: OS 22/04 - Part 2 FS | 10 October 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • the purpose of the charity is for the public benefit; and • the purpose is charitable charitable entity (referred to as a “registered charity”) Defined in the Charities Act: • a society, institution or the trustee of a trust • that is registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act charitable organisation Defined in the ITA s YA 1, for a quarter or an income year: • an association, fund, institution, organisation, society or trust; o that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual; and o whose funds are applied wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand; • an entity approved by Parliament and listed in schedule 32 (Recipients of charitable or other public benefit gifts); • an entity that has been removed from the register of charitable entities (for a limited time while appeal is pending); • does not include a local authority, a public authority or a university tax charity Defined in the ITA ss YA 1 and CW 41(5) – generally: • a registered charity (including a deregistered entity for a limited time while appeal of deregistration is pending); and • any non-resident entity carrying out charitable purposes overseas the Commissioner has approved as a tax charity OS 22/04 - Part 2 FS | 10 October 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Figure 1: Relationship between overlapping definitions in the ITA and Charities Act Types of donee organisations To qualify for donee status, an entity must satisfy at least one of the descriptions of a donee organisation set out in s LD 3(2) or be approved by Parliament and listed in schedule 32 as a recipient of charitable or other public benefit gifts. The four types of donee organisation are: • entities registered with Charities Services that receive donations and that apply its funds “wholly or mainly” to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand, see from \[17\] – \[2 4\]. In administration of the wholly or mainly requirement, the Commissioner uses a “safe harbour” basis of 75% or more. To maintain donee status, an entity may calculate the percentage of funds applied in New Zealand by using a rolling three-year average. However, if in any year it applies less than 50% of its funds to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand, it needs to notify Inland Revenue immediately, as it no longer has donee status, see \[49\] – \[59\]; • entities not eligible to register under the Charities Act that have benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes, which can be approved as donee organisations by the Commissioner upon application, see from \[25\] – \[92\]; • entities that automatically qualify by satisfying specific definitions, such as certain community housing entities, board of trustees constituted under the Education and OS 22/04 - Part 2 FS | 10 October 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Training Act 2020 that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and certain tertiary education institutions, see \[93\] – \[9 5\]; and • entities that apply funds for other than charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes in New Zealand, approved by Parliament and listed in schedule 32, see \[96\] – \[108\]. Tax benefits of being a donee organisation The main advantage of being a donee organisation is the benefit it brings to the donors who make charitable or other public benefit gifts of $5 or more. Individuals who make such gifts may qualify for tax benefits (such as donation tax credits or payroll giving tax credits), while companies and Māori authorities can qualify for tax benefits (such as income tax gift deductions). These tax benefits are subject to maximum limits. A donee organisation that is a tax charity may qualify for various income tax exemptions for its business and non-business income, see Part 1 Charities. A donee organisation that meets the definition of charitable organisation may be eligible for resident withholding tax (RWT) exemption, fringe benefit tax (FBT) exclusion and interest-free student loans for overseas volunteers. Donee organisations that are non-profit bodies (as defined in s 2(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985) may also qualify for goods and services tax (GST) concessions, see Part 1 Charities. For a more detailed discussion of the tax benefits of being a donee organisation, see \[109\] – \[139\]. Record keeping All donee organisations should keep sufficient records in English or te reo Māori to calculate any tax liability and to demonstrate eligibility for tax exemptions or concessions. Donee organisations must keep a record of the sources of any donations made to it and how its funds have been used, within New Zealand or overseas. If the Commissioner requests, a donee organisation may be required to provide a breakdown of donations received, including donor details, respective payment dates and payment methods. If a donee organisation is registered for GST, it must keep records as required under s 75 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Records should be kept for a minimum of seven years, even if the donee organisation ceases operating. OS 22/04 - Part 2 FS | 10 October 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] For a more detailed discussion of the record keeping requirements, see \[155\] – \[161\]. Requirement to self-assess and notify changes A donee organisation must continually self-assess, on an annual basis at a minimum, to determine whether it continues to meet the donee status requirements. If a donee organisation determines that it no longer meets the requirements, it must immediately cease issuing donation tax receipts and inform the Commissioner of its change in circumstances. The entity will then be removed from the Commissioner’s list of Approved donee organisations (if it was included there). If the entity is listed in schedule 32, the Commissioner will inform Parliament that the entity no longer qualifies for inclusion and Parliament will take the necessary steps to remove it from the schedule. For a more detailed discussion of the requirement to self-assess and notify changes, see \[162\] – \[164\]. Winding up, deregistration and removal of donee status On winding up, a donee organisation’s remaining income and/or assets should be applied to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand. The donee organisation’s rules or constitution should contain provisions outlining what will happen to remaining income and assets on winding up. A donee organisation may have other statutory requirements that apply on winding up (for example, requirements on liquidation or dissolution). Donee organisations that are registered charities that become deregistered lose donee status. If it appeals the deregistration, it should notify the Commissioner. If the deregistered charity does not appeal the deregistration, donors will not be able to claim a donation tax credit or income tax gift deduction for any donations made during the period of deregistration. A deregistered charity must ensure its donation tax receipts, websites and newsletters clearly state that donations made after the date of deregistration will not qualify a donor for a donation tax credit or an income tax deduction. OS 22/04 - Part 2 FS | 10 October 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The deregistered charity may make a written application to the Commissioner to again be a donee organisation, demonstrating its benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purpose and satisfaction of the other requirements for donee status. The Commissioner’s decision to remove an organisation’s donee status is a “disputable decision” that can be challenged through the disputes process. For a more detailed discussion of winding up, deregistration and removal of donee status, see \[167\] – \[173\] of Part 2 Donee organisations.

OPERATIONAL STATEMENT When employee allowances for additional transport costs for home to work travel are exempt from income tax Issu ed: 3/05/2023 OS 23/01 Operational Statements set out the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (the Commissioner’s) view of the law and deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Statement covers when employee allowances for additional transport costs for home to work travel are exempt from income tax under s CW 18. All legislative references in this Statement are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless specified otherwise. Introduction 1.Payments an employer makes for a private expense of an employee are usually subject to income tax in the hands of the employee. 2.The general rule is that home-to-work travel is private expenditure as it is expenditure to get to work and reflects the employee’s personal choice about where their home is. The two main reasons for this rule are that the: employee’s private choices (about where to live and how to get to work) are the key factor in determining the cost of home-to-work travel. OS 23/01 | 03 May 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  expense of starting work is distinguished from expenses while “on work”, and employees are expected to bear the cost of starting work. 3. As this expenditure is usually private, if the employer provides the employee with an allowance for travel from home to work, the starting point is that it is taxable. 4. If an allowance is taxable for income tax purposes, then the employer must deduct and pay PAYE for that payment. This is because the allowance is “salary or wages” under the PAYE rules. 5. However, s CW 18 exempts from tax some allowances that an employee receives from their employer to reimburse additional transport costs arising from the employee’s travel from home to work (the additional transport costs exemption). This means that PAYE does not have to be deducted from the allowance. 6. The purpose of this Statement is to clarify when this exemption applies and to help employers to determine the amount of tax payable. 7. It includes examples for further clarification. Summary of approach 8. The Commissioner considers that three main steps are needed to determine the extent to which the additional transport costs exemption applies to an allowance an employer pays to an employee for travel from home to work: Recent changes mean that FBT does not apply to certain public transport fares that an employer subsidises. Employers who provide subsidised public transport to employees can find further information at Employer provided unclassified fringe benefits (ird.govt.nz) Employers also often provide travel for their employees from home to a distant workplace. These employers may find it useful to refer to the Commissioner’s position on employer-provided travel: OS 19/05: E mployer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace – income tax (PAYE) and fringe benefit tax (Inland Revenue, 2019). OS 23/01 | 03 May 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  Step One – Are one or more of the factors present that are required for the exemption to additional transport costs to apply? If none of these factors is present, then the additional transport costs exemption cannot apply.  Step Two – Did the employee incur the additional transport costs in connection with their employment and for the employer’s benefit or convenience?  Step Three – How much of a travel allowance is exempt under the additional transport costs exemption? Calculate the additional transport costs and compare them with the allowance paid. Definitions 9. Key terms in this Statement have the following definitions:  Additional transport costs are costs to an employee of travelling between their home and place of work that are more than would ordinarily be expected. (See also \[ 11 \].)  Additional transport c osts exemption means the exemption from income tax for some allowances an employer pays for the employee’s cost of home-to-work travel provided for in s CW 18.  Home means a dwelling the employee uses as their residence.  Travel allowance means an allowance an employer pays to an employee (or a group of employees) to reimburse them for their travel between home and work.  Workplace means a particular place or base:  where an employee performs their employment duties; or  from which an employee’s duties are allocated. This means that a workplace is not confined to premises of the employer. It can be where the employee performs employment duties, which could be a client’s premises. 1 1 The question of whether a client’s premises would qualify as workplace for these purposes is a question of fact and degree. It is intended to address situations where the employee’s work pattern is such that they are effectively working from, and based at, the client’s premise for a period of time. Most situations where employees merely visit client’s premise will not suffice. OS 23/01 | 03 May 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Discussion When does the additional transport costs exemption apply? 10. A travel allowance will be exempt under the additional transport costs exemption in s CW 18 to the extent that:  the allowance reimburses the employee for their additional transport costs; and  the employee incurred those transport costs in connection with their employment and for the employer’s benefit or convenience. 11. “Additional transport costs” are costs to an employee of travelling between their home and place of work that are more than would ordinarily be expected. The costs must be attributable to one or more of the following factors: 2 (a) the day or time of day when the work duties are performed: (b) the need to transport any goods or material for use or disposal in the course of the employee’s work: (c) the requirement to fulfil a statutory obligation: (d) a temporary change in the employee’s place of work while in the same employment: (e) any other condition of the employee’s work: (f) the absence of an adequate public passenger transport service that operates fixed routes and a regular timetable for the employee’s place of work. 12. The Commissioner considers that three main steps determine the extent that the additional transport costs exemption applies to an allowance an employer pays to an employee for travel between home and work:  Step One – Are one or more of the factors ((a) to (f)) present that are required for the exemption to apply? If none of the factors is present, then the additional transport costs exemption cannot apply.  Step Two – Did the employee incur the transport costs in connection with their employment and for the employer’s benefit or convenience? 2 Section CW 18(3). OS 23/01 | 03 May 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  Step Three – How much of a travel allowance is exempt under the additional transport costs exemption? Calculate the additional transport costs and compare them with the allowance paid. Step One – Are one or more of the factors present that are required for the exemption to apply? 13. As one or more of the factors listed in s CW 18 must be present for the additional transport costs exemption to apply, an employer's first step is to determine whether any of these factors are present. 14. Each of these factors ((a) to (f)) is discussed in turn below. Factor (a): The day or time of day when the work duties are performed 15. For this factor to apply, the additional transport costs must be attributable to:  the time or times of the day, or  the day (or days) of the week that the employee was required to perform the duties of that employment (Example 1). 3 If the employee needs to use their personal car to travel home from work as no public transport is available, then the additional cost of driving that car to work will be part of the cost. to be taken into account in determining any additional transport costs. Example 1: Factor (a) applies Employees of a restaurant start their shift at 4 pm and finish after midnight. Public transport serves the place of work at 4 pm but stops at 11 pm. The employees need alternative transport home that will usually cost more than public transport. 3 OS 23/01 | 03 May 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Factor (b): The need to transport any items for use or disposal in the course of the employee’s work 16. This factor will apply if, as part of their job, the employee is required to use a particular type of transport (which they provide or pay for) to move any of the following items:  plant,  machinery,  equipment,  technical aids,  goods, or  material. 17. The employee must move those items, as part of their job, for use or disposal (Example 3). Example 2: Factor (a) applies Jake is an e mployee of the city council who starts their shift at 7am and finish at 7pm. On Sunday public transport serves Jake’s work but only after 7am. Jake needs to take alternative transport to work that usually costs more than public transport. Example 3: Factor (b) applies Harlie is an assistant garage door installer in a provincial city. Being environmentally conscious, she prefers to use her e-bike to get to work. Occasionally, however, her employer needs her to collect a scissor lift from a hire centre for use on that day. On those days, Harlie needs to use her motor vehicle to collect the scissor lift on the way to work. Harlie’s employer pays her an allowance to recognise the additional costs she incurs because she needs to use her motor vehicle on those days. OS 23/01 | 03 May 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Factor (c): Fulfilling an obligation under any Act 18. This factor will apply if an employee incurs the transport costs in fulfilling an obligation that arises under any Act. The Commissioner considers that this factor will also apply to regulations issued under any Act. 19. Importantly, this provision does not apply simply because an Act provides for a travel allowance to be paid to certain employees. While the employer is fulfilling a statutory obligation by paying the allowance, the employee must incur additional transport costs in fulfilling a statutory obligation before this factor applies (Example 4). Factor (d): A temporary change in the employee’s place of work from the normal place of work for the same employer 20. Factor (d) will apply when the employee has a temporary change in their place of work while still working for the same employer. 21. In line with the approach in OS 19/05 ( which relates to employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace), the Commissioner will treat a change in workplace as temporary (for the purposes of determining whether the additional transport costs exemption applies) if that change is for two years or less (Example 5). 22. To treat the change as temporary, the employer must be able to show that the parties reasonably expected the change would be for two years or less. Reasonable expectation is initially measured at the time the requirement for the change arose. 23. Evidence for the parties’ expectation may come from the employee’s terms of employment. I n many cases, however, no written agreement may exist. Other documentation such as board minutes, planning documents and correspondence may demonstrate how long the parties expected the change would be. Example 4: Factor (c) applies Due to the nature of her employment Penelope is required to get a COVID-19 test every week under a Public Health Order. She usually travels to work by public transport but cannot use public transport to get the COVID-19 test. One day a week Penelope takes her car to work so she can get tested on the way. Penelope’s employer pays her an allowance to recognise the additional costs she incurs because she needs to use her car on that day. OS 23/01 | 03 May 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 24. It is possible that a payment for additional transports costs that is initially treated as non-taxable can become taxable. If it becomes clear that the parties now have a reasonable expectation that the requirement for the employee to change their place of work is no longer temporary (for a period of two years or less), any payment will be taxable from the date the expectation changed (Example 6). 4 25. Equally, if it becomes clear that a change in location which was expected to be more than a temporary requirement is now expected to be a temporary requirement (a period of two years or less), any payment for additional transport costs can be treated as non-taxable from the date the expectation changed. Factor (e): Any other condition of work of the employee 26. The Commissioner considers that factor (e) has limited application. That is, it refers to “any other condition of the employee’s work” that the legislation does not identify but is similar to the factors the legislation specifically lists. 5 27. An employer must be able to explain how the particular condition of work is similar to the factors listed. 4 Not from the end of the original date of the arrangement. 5 Factors (a)–(d) and (f). Example 5: A temporary change in place of work (factor (d)) applies Robyn usually works in the Wellington central business district. She is seconded to work in her employer’s Lower Hutt branch office for 12 months. As the secondment is for two years or less (in this case, 12 months), this is a temporary change in her work location. Her employer can treat this travel as temporary. Example 6: A temporary change in place of work (factor (d)) does not apply After 11 months of working at the Lower Hutt branch office, Robyn and her employer agree that she will continue to work there for another 16 months. As the parties now expect that Robyn will be working in Lower Hutt for more than two years (27 months in total), from the date their expectation changed her employer can no longer treat her travel there as temporary. OS 23/01 | 03 May 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 28. For the exemption to apply, “any other condition” would have to increase the cost of travelling between an employee’s house and their workplace by more than what would be ordinarily expected. It would also have to be for the benefit or convenience of the employer. Factor (f): The absence of an adequate public passenger transport service that operates fixed routes and a regular timetable for the employee’s place of work 29. Factor (f) applies when no public passenger transport service serves an employee’s place of work (Example 7) . T o qualify as servicing the place of work, the public transport service must operate fixed routes and a regular timetable that service the employee’s place of work (Example 8). 30. It is important to note that whether a public passenger transport service serves an employee’s home does not determine whether their place of work is serviced by an adequate public transport service . 31. The Commissioner considers that where the public transport services available do not neatly fit with an employee’s hours of work, that does not in itself mean that the public transport service is inadequate. Example 7: No public transport service – factor (f) applies Rosie’s employer is based 10 kilometres outside Masterton. Although a bus network serves Wairarapa, it does not provide services near Rosie’s workplace. In this example, no public transport service serves Rosie’s workplace and factor (f) applies. Example 8: A public transport service operates – factor (f) does not apply The bus network provides a regular, timetabled service to Rosie’s employer but it does not go near her house. In this example, a public transport service serves Rosie’s workplace so factor (f) does not apply. OS 23/01 | 03 May 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 32. The Commissioner considers that this factor will apply when a workplace:  has no public transport service at all;  has no public transport service available to shift workers;  clearly has more employees starting work at one time than public transport can accommodate; or  is not close to the nearest bus, train or ferry stop. 6 Step Two – Did the employee incur the additional transport costs in connection with their employment and for the employer’s benefit or convenience? 33. The Commissioner accepts that where an employee incurs additional transport costs as a result of one of the listed factors, they will incur those costs in connection with their employment. 34. This means that the key question to answer at Step Two is whether the employee incurred the costs for the employer’s benefit or convenience. 35. This means that, for any allowance to be exempt, one of the factors (a) to (f) must arise from the nature of the employment or a need or requirement of the employer (Example 9). 36. It cannot arise for the benefit or convenience of the employee. 6 Historically, Inland Revenue has considered that a workplace that is located within 1.6km walking distance of the nearest bus or train or ferry stop is close to the nearest stop. Example 9: Employee incurs transport costs for employer’s benefit or convenience Mikaere usually works in the Christchurch CBD. Due to staff shortages, h e is seconded for six months to work at his employer’s branch office located at Christchurch Airport. As this temporary change in work location arises from a need of the employer, it is for the employer’s benefit or convenience and the additional transport costs exemption can apply. OS 23/01 | 03 May 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Step Three – How much of a travel allowance is exempt under the additional transport costs exemption? 37. The amount of the allowance that is exempt from income tax is the amount that relates to the additional transport costs. 38. This means that to determine how much of any travel allowance is exempt, an employer must identify what those additional costs are. Then the employer must compare the total amount of the allowance paid with the additional transport costs to determine how much of the allowance is exempt. 39. If the additional transport costs the employee incurred are less than the total allowance, only the amount that is equal to the additional transport costs is exempt. 40. If the additional transport costs the employee incurred are equal to or greater than the actual allowance paid, the entire allowance is exempt. Calculating any additional transport costs: factors (a) to (e) 41. When any of factors (a) to (e) apply (but not (f)), the additional costs are the amount by which the costs are more than the travel costs the employee would ordinarily expect without reference to that factor. 42. This means that the amount of the additional transport costs is not the total transport costs. Rather, it is the total transport costs less the costs the employer would have “expected to find” the employee incurred “in the ordinary course of events” if the factors that caused the employee to incur the “additional” travel costs did not apply (Examples 11 and 12) . Example 10: Employee incurs transport costs for their own benefit or convenience What if the change was made because Mikaere asked for a temporary change in location due to his personal circumstances rather than because of staff shortages? In that case, the temporary change arises from Mikaere’s personal need, so the change is for his benefit or convenience not his employer’s. This means that the additional transport costs exemption cannot apply. OS 23/01 | 03 May 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Calculating any additional transport costs – factor (f): lack of public transport 43. When the employee incurs the additional transport costs because of a lack of public transport services (see \[29\]), the additional transport costs are the amount by which the Example 11: Calculating additional transport costs where costs are higher than ordinarily expected Robyn works in the Wellington CBD. She is seconded to work in her employer’s Lower Hutt branch office for 12 months. Normally, Robyn’s costs of getting to work involve a return bus trip with a weekly cost of $30. But this temporary change in work location requires her to take the train as well at the cost of an additional $43 a week. The additional transport cost per week is $43. Any allowance up to $43 will be exempt. Example 12: Costs must be higher than ordinarily expected Bob (a builder) works for a company whose depot is in Seaview in Lower Hutt, but he rarely visits the depot. Instead, he travels directly to various building sites. Most of the sites are in the Wellington CBD but from time to time his employer sends him to building sites in other parts of the Wellington region. The fact that an employee may be working at multiple sites in a geographic area will not be relevant to the s CW 18 exemption if the costs of travel to those diverse sites are not more than would ordinarily be expected. However, if the employer decided that Bob was needed to work in Featherston (in the Wairarapa region), that might be a temporary change in the place of work that would lead to higher than ordinary costs. In that way, the costs could come within the s CW 18 exemption. OS 23/01 | 03 May 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 13 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] costs are more than $5 for each day on which the employee attends work (Example 13). Limit of 70 kilometres a day 44. There is a limit on what travel an employer can take into account in calculating additional transport costs. 45. An employer should not take into account the costs of travelling any distance over 70 kilometres in 1 day in calculating additional transport costs. This means that, to the extent that the allowance is exempt because it is for additional transport costs, the exemption is limited to the costs for travelling up to 70 kilometres in 1 day. 46. However, in special circumstances, an employer does include the costs of travelling any distance over 70 kilometres in 1 day in calculating additional transport costs. 47. The phrase “except in special circumstances” means that those circumstances are set apart from the usual case. It covers exceptional, abnormal or unusual and is not limited to extraordinary or unique cases. 48. It is important to understand that the simple fact that an employee has to travel more than 70 kilometres between work and home is not a “special circumstance” (Example 14). 49. Given the obligation is on the employer to assess whether there are special circumstances justifying exempting additional transport costs for distances over 70 kilometres per day, the employer needs to be able to demonstrate that the circumstances meet the statutory test of “special circumstances” (Example 15). 50. The special circumstances must arise from the location of the workplace rather than where the employee chooses to live. Example 13: Calculating additional transport costs where no public transport is available There is no public transport service to Rosie’s workplace so factor (f) applies. Rosie incurs transport costs of $60 a week getting to work for a five-day working week. In this example, the additional transport costs are $35 ($60 – (5 × $5)). Any allowance paid to Rosie for additional transport costs up to $35 will be exempt. If Rosie was paid the entire $60, $35 would be exempt and $25 would be subject to tax. OS 23/01 | 03 May 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 14 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Additional transport costs – estimated expenditure of employees 51. In determining the additional transport costs, the employer may make a reasonable estimate of the amount of expenditure the employee or a group of employees is likely to incur for which they can receive reimbursement. 52. In calculating the additional transport costs involving the use of a motor vehicle, an employer can use the approach in OS 19/04b: Commissioner’s statement on using a kilometre rate for employee reimbursement of a motor vehicle (Inland Revenue, 2019) to make a reasonable estimate of the costs the employee is likely to incur (Example 16). Example 14: Special circumstances do not apply Paullina lives in Waikanae but is working in Wellington (60 kilometres one way, and 120 kilometres return). Her employer pays her an allowance to meet the transport costs of getting to work in Wellington. To the extent that the allowance is exempt because it is for additional transport costs, the exemption is limited to the costs for travelling 70 k ilometres in 1 day. The costs for the additional 50 k ilometres of travel per day are not exempt unless special circumstances exist. “Special circumstances” do not exist just because Paullina’s daily commute is longer than 70 kilometres. Example 15: Special circumstances do apply Barry works in a national park where there is no accommodation. Barry lives in the nearest town, which is more than 50 k ilometres away. His round trip each day between that accommodation and his workplace is more than 70 kilometres. In this example, special circumstances exist because no one (including Barry) could live any closer to his workplace. However, these “special circumstances” would not exist just because Barry’s daily commute is longer than 70 kilometres. OS 23/01 | 03 May 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 15 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 53. In making a reasonable estimate for a group of employees, the employer should use a system that groups “like” employees together. (In this way, any exemption can be related to a fair and reasonable estimate of costs the employees incur.) What if circumstances change? 54. If circumstances change, then the extent to which any allowance is exempt may change. 55. For example, in some cases, as the result of a change in circumstances, none of the factors required for an exemption may be present anymore. If the employer continues to pay the allowance in such a case, none of that allowance would be exempt. 56. The Commissioner is aware that in some situations, employers are continuing to treat an allowance for additional transport costs as tax exempt even when an employee no longer incurs those costs on every working day (because the employee now works from home). The allowance is only exempt to the extent it is for additional transport costs. An employer will need to adjust the amount treated as exempt under the additional transport costs exemption to reflect the change in circumstances. 7 Based on 2022 rates in OS 19/04 (KM 2022) : “Kilometre rates for the business use of vehicles for the 2022 income year.” 8 5 × $5 per day non-exempt amount. 9 If Rosie was a part-time worker the calculation would need to reflect the number of days travelled to work in that situation. Example 16: A reasonable estimate of the costs the employee is likely to incur There is no public transport service to Rosie’s workplace, so factor (f) applies. Rosie uses her car to get to work each day. The total distance she travels each working day is 40 kilometres. This equates to 200 kilometres a week. The employer could use the Tier One rate for the cost per kilometre estimate of expenditure. So each week 7 Rosie’s additional transport costs are 200 × 83 cents, which equals $166. Then the employer subtracts $25 8 to arrive at additional transport costs of $1 41. Any allowance paid to Rosie for additional transport costs up to $141 will be exempt. 9 OS 23/01 | 03 May 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 16 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] What if an employee is required to enter into a salary sacrifice to receive the allowance? 57. If an employee can only receive an allowance for additional transport costs by entering into a salary sacrifice arrangement, then the Commissioner considers that the allowance does not truly reimburse the employee for those costs. As such, the employer should not treat the allowance in question as exempt under the additional transport costs exemption. Rather, they should treat it as a taxable allowance with PAYE deducted.

Estimated expenditure of employees (2) For the purposes of subsection (1),— (a) the employer may make, for a relevant period, a reasonable estimate of the amount of expenditure likely to be incurred by the employee or a group of employees for which reimbursement is payable; and (b) the amount estimated is treated as if it were the amount incurred during the period to which the estimate relates. Meaning of additional transport costs (3) In this section, additional transport costs means the costs to an employee of travelling between their home and place of work that are more than would ordinarily be expected. The costs must be attributable to 1 or more of the following factors: (a) the day or time of day when the work duties are performed: (b) the need to transport any goods or material for use or disposal in the course of the employee’s work: (c) the requirement to fulfil a statutory obligation: (d) a temporary change in the employee’s place of work while in the same employment: (e) any other condition of the employee’s work: (f) the absence of an adequate public passenger transport service that operates fixed routes and a regular timetable for the employee’s place of work. Quantifying additional transport costs (4) Additional transport costs are quantified as follows: (a) when the additional transport costs are attributed to a factor described in any of subsection (3)(a) to (e), the amount by which the costs are more than the employee’s ordinarily expected travel costs without reference to that factor: (b) when the additional transport costs are attributed to the factor described in subsection (3)(f), the amount by which the costs are more than $5 for each day on which the employee attends work: (c) except in special circumstances, the costs of travelling any distance over 70 kilometres in 1 day are not taken into account in calculating additional transport costs.
OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Exemption from electronic filing Issued: 06 June 2024 OS 24/01 Operational statements set out the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s view of the law in respect of the matter discussed and deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. REPLACES  OS 19/01: Exemption from electronic filing – the operational position remains unchanged from OS 19/01, but legislative references have been updated. OS 24/01 | 06 June 2024 Page 1 of 6 Introduction All legislative references in this Statement are to the Tax Administration Act 1994, unless specified otherwise. This Statement replaces OS 19/01. The operational position is unchanged but legislative references and the format of the Statement has been updated. This Statement sets out the criteria for a person to be granted an exemption from the requirement to file returns/information electronically in relation to:  an employer who is included in the online group of employers;  a GST registered person who exceeds the statutory threshold for filing returns electronically;  a person who makes a payment of investment income. Application of the statement 1. This Operational Statement applies to the exemptions from electronic filing that the Commissioner may grant under sections 23G, 25P and 36BD(3). It does not apply to requests for variations from the requirement of the Act under sections 23Q and 25R. If a person has concerns with complying with the legislation outside the matters covered by this Statement, they should contact Inland Revenue immediately to discuss their situation. 2. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017-2018, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 contained, amongst other measures, changes to improve the administration of the PAYE rules and to improve the collection of investment income information and the provision of GST information. 3. Employers that are included in the online group of employers are required to supply their employment income information electronically to Inland Revenue. An employer is in the online group if their gross amounts of tax payable for the preceding tax year exceeds $50,000 or the amount set by Order in Council. 4. Payers of investment income are required to supply their investment income information electronically. 5. Currently there is no threshold set for GST registered persons to be required to file electronically. Thresholds are set and amended by Order in Council and may be amended at any time. OS 24/01 | 06 June 2024 Page 2 of 6 6. An exemption from the requirement to file/supply information electronically will be available for those who are unable to comply due to the lack, or inadequacy, of digital services. Legislation The relevant provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are: 23G Exemption for certain employers in online group (1) The Commissioner may exempt an employer in the online group from the online group requirements if it is reasonable in the circumstances, taking into account- (a) the nature and availability of digital services to the employer, including the reliability of those services for the purposes of the employer; and (b) the capability of the employer relating to the use of computers; and (c) the costs that the employer would incur in complying with the requirements if those costs would be unreasonable in the circumstances. (2) The Commissioner must provide a statement of reasons for the exemption. (3) Subject to subsection (4), an exemption under this section remains valid until the Commissioner notifies the employer that the exemption is to be cancelled. The exemption expires on the date that is 6 months after that given in the Commissioner’s notice. (4) In making an exemption under this section, the Commissioner may set a time limit on the exemption, stating a start date and an end date, as applicable, for the exemption and the reason for setting the limit. 25P Non-electronic filing of investment income information (1) Despite sections 25F to 25N, the Commissioner may exempt a payer from the requirement to deliver their investment income information in electronic form and by means of an electronic communication. The Commissioner must provide a statement of reasons for the exemption. (2) In determining whether to exempt a payer under subsection (1), the Commissioner must have regard to— (a) the nature and availability of digital services to the payer, including the reliability of those services for the purposes of the payer; and (b) the capability of the payer relating to the use of computers; and (c) the costs that the payer would incur in complying with the requirements if those costs would be unreasonable in the circumstances. (3) Subject to subsection (4), an exemption under this section remains valid until the Commissioner notifies the payer that the exemption is to be cancelled. The exemption expires on the date that is 6 months after that given in the Commissioner’s notice. (4) In making an exemption under this section, the Commissioner may set a time limit on the exemption, stating a start date and an end date, as applicable, for the exemption and the reason for setting the limit. OS 24/01 | 06 June 2024 Page 3 of 6 36BD Electronic filing requirements for registered persons (1) The Commissioner must prescribe 1 or more electronic forms or means of electronic communication that- (d) a registered person may use to file a return required under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985; or (e) a registered person whose taxable supplies exceed the threshold set out in subsection (2) must use to file a return under the Act. (2) The Governor-General may, on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue, make an Order in Council setting a threshold for the value of taxable supplies of a registered person that means the person is required to use an electronic form or means of electronic communication for filing a return under that Act. Before making the recommendation, the Minister must undertake consultation on the proposed threshold that is appropriate and reasonable for the purposes of this section. (3) The Commissioner may exempt a registered person, or a class of registered persons, whose taxable supplies exceed the threshold from the requirement to file in the prescribed electronic form or by the prescribed means of electronic communication. The Commissioner must provide a statement of reasons for the exemption. (4) In determining under subsection (3) whether to exempt the person or class of persons, the Commissioner must have regard to— (f) the nature and availability of digital services to the person or persons in the class, including the reliability of those services for the purposes of the person or persons; and (g) the capability of the person or persons in the class relating to the use of computers; and (h) the costs that the person or persons in the class would incur in complying with the requirements if those costs would be unreasonable in the circumstances. (5) Subject to subsection (6), an exemption under this section remains valid until the Commissioner notifies the registered person that the exemption is to be cancelled. The exemption expires on the date that is 6 months after that given in the Commissioner’s notice. (6) In making an exemption under this section, the Commissioner may set a time limit on the exemption, stating a start date and an end date, as applicable, for the exemption and the reason for setting the limit. (7) The following are secondary legislation (see Part 3 of the Legislation Act 2019 for publication requirements): (i) an order under subsection (2): (j) an exemption under subsection (3), unless it applies only to 1 or more named persons. Discussion 7. In relation to an employer, a payer of investment income or a GST registered person who must provide information to the Commissioner in electronic form and by an electronic means of communication (the use of digital services), the legislation grants the Commissioner the power to exempt a person from this obligation. The exemption provisions for an employer, a payer of investment income or a registered person are the same and can be considered together. 8. In deciding whether to grant a person an exemption, the Commissioner must consider:  the nature and availability of digital services to the person, including the reliability of those services for the purposes of the person; and OS 24/01 | 06 June 2024 Page 4 of 6  the capability of the person relating to the use of computers; and  whether the costs that would be incurred by the person in complying with the requirement of the legislation would be unreasonable. Nature, availability and reliability of digital services 9. The term “digital services” refers to the delivery, processing, recording, generating and the displaying of information electronically. It includes but is not limited to, interestenabled systems, email, text, and apps. For a person to send information electronically to Inland Revenue they will require at least a computer, tablet or similar device that is able to connect to the internet. No specific or special software will be required as a person will be able to file electronically through the MyIR portal on Inland Revenue’s website. 10. In regards, to the nature and availability of digital services to a person, the Commissioner will take into account the availability of connection to the internet and type of connection. Some rural areas of New Zealand do not have any access to the internet. Without the ability to connect to the internet, a person is not going to be able to comply with the legislation. The Commissioner accepts that a person will need at least a broadband internet connection to be able to supply information electronically. 11. The Commissioner will also consider the reliability of the internet connection that the person has access to. If the connection is prone to frequent disconnections or slow speeds, these may be a factor in the Commissioner granting an exemption. An unreliable internet connection will be a significant factor in granting an exemption from the requirement to file returns/information electronically. Capability 12. The Commissioner will consider whether the person has the necessary computer skills to be able to use the digital technology. If not, do they have an employee, or can they engage the services of someone, who is able to use digital services? 13. If a person uses a computer with an internet connection in their business or as part of their everyday affairs, it is reasonable to expect that they will have little difficulty in sending the necessary returns/information electronically to Inland Revenue. OS 24/01 | 06 June 2024 Page 5 of 6 Are the costs in complying unreasonable? 14. As well as considering the nature and availably of digital services, the Commissioner must also take into account whether the costs that would be incurred by the person in complying with the legislation would be unreasonable. 15. This is a question of what is unreasonable in the circumstances of the person. The use of computers and other digital devices is now common in New Zealand. Typically, an employer or a registered person would use a computer as part of their business and in all likelihood that computer will be connected to the internet (if access is available). The Commissioner expects that where a person is connected to the internet and uses digital services as part of their everyday business, e.g., email, internet banking, electronic invoicing for instance, there will be no impediment for the person meeting the requirements of the legislation and to file returns/information electronically. No material compliance costs will necessarily result as the person can use the MyIR portal on Inland Revenue’s website to provide the information electronically. 16. The Commissioner will consider whether the costs that would be incurred by the person are materially more than would be expected to be borne by a person in similar circumstances. For instance, a high-country farmer without access to the internet through the copper wire network or fibre may be faced with a substantial cost to connect via satellite (installation of equipment and ongoing subscription costs) compared to a farmer in another area of the country who has ready access to broadband. 17. It is accepted that the circumstances for some payers of investment income may be different to that of an employer or a registered person in that they may not necessarily be in business and are perhaps less likely to have a computer or any means to connect to the internet. It is the Commissioner’s view that it would be unreasonable to expect such a person to incur the cost of buying a computer and connecting to the internet for the sole purpose of meeting the requirements of the legislation. An exemption would appear appropriate in such circumstances. Applying for an exemption 18. The following information is to be provided when applying for an exemption from electronic filing:  name;  IRD/GST Number; OS 24/01 | 06 June 2024 Page 6 of 6  the exemption that is being applied for, i.e., employer, registered person or investment income payer;  whether the person owns or has access to a computer, smart phone, tablet or similar device that is capable of connecting to the internet;  a detailed reason for requiring an exemption. Specifically, what issues are faced in filing returns or providing information electronically that would impose unreasonable compliance costs on the person. 19. The above information can be provided in MyIR or via a tax agent. Alternatively, at one of Inland Revenue’s front of house customer sites or via post. 20. Where the Commissioner decides to allow an exemption to the person, he will provide reasons for the exemption being granted. 21. When granting an exemption, the Commissioner may set a start date and an end date on the exemption. In such a case the Commissioner will provide the reason for setting the time limit. 22. Where no time limit is set, the exemption will apply until the person is notified by the Commissioner that it is to be cancelled. In this case the exemption will expire on the date that is 6 months after the date given in the notification. The Commissioner reserves the right to revoke a person’s exemption at any time it is determined that the person’s circumstances have changed and now must file electronically.

The following information is to be provided when applying for an exemption from electronic filing: • Name; UNCLASSIFIED • IRD/GST Number; • The exemption that is being applied for, i.e. employer, registered person or investment income payer; • Whether the person owns or has access to a computer, smart phone, tablet or similar device that is capable of connecting to the internet; • A detailed reason for requiring an exemption. Specifically, what issues are faced in filing returns or providing information electronically that would impose unreasonable compliance costs on the person. 19. Where the Commissioner decides to allow an exemption to the person, she will provide the reasons for the exemption being granted. 20. When granting an exemption, the Commissioner may set a start date and an end date on the exemption. In such a case the Commissioner will provide the reason for setting the time limit. 21. Where no time limit is set, the exemption will apply until the person is notified by the Commissioner that it is to be cancelled. In this case the exemption will expire on the date that is 6 months after the date given in the notification. The Commissioner reserves the right to revoke a person’s exemption at any time it is determined that the person’s circumstances have changed and now must file electronically.

Date of issue: 04/04/2019 UNCLASSIFIED Operational statement OS 19/02 Persons who are permitted to confirm an income statement of a deceased person or provide information to the Commissioner to finalise the tax account of a deceased person Introduction This operational statement lists the persons who are able to confirm an income statement of a deceased person under s RZ 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA 2007) and who can provide information to the Commissioner to finalise a deceased person’s tax account under s 22F of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA 94) where the deceased does not have a will and no executor or administrator has been appointed. Application This operational statement applies from the date that it is signed. Summary The following persons may confirm an income statement issued in respect of the income years from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2019 where the income statement was issued in respect of a deceased person who died without a will and an executor or administrator has not been appointed: • The widow or widower of the deceased person • A person who is the surviving civil union/de-facto partner of the deceased person • A child of the deceased person • A person who is entitled to administer the estate • A person related by blood or marriage and be maintaining the deceased person’s child/children • A person who has the custody and control of the deceased person’s child/children OS 19/02: 04/04/2019 2 UNCLASSIFIED The following persons may supply information to finalise income years from 1 April 2019 of a deceased person who died without a will and an executor or administrator has not been appointed: • The widow or widower of the deceased person • A person who is the surviving civil union/de-facto partner of the deceased person • A child of the deceased person • A person who is entitled to administer the estate • A person related by blood or marriage and be maintaining the deceased person’s child/children • A person who has the custody and control of the deceased person’s child/children Discussion 1. Under s RM 5 (repealed from 1 April 2019) of the ITA 2007, a person who receives an income statement that results in a refund of more than $600 must confirm that the income statement is correct before the refund can be issued. 2. Where the person has died, the executor or administrator of the person’s estate will be able to confirm an income statement by virtue of s 43 of the TAA 1994. However, where the person has died without making a will and no executor or administrator has been appointed, it was unclear as to whether relatives of the deceased person would be able to confirm the income statement and receive the refund. 3. Therefore, s RZ 15 of the ITA 2007 has been introduced to allow certain classes of persons to confirm the income statement of a person who has died and for whom no executor or administrator has been appointed where the amount of the refund does not exceed $15,000. Section RZ 15 applies to income statements issued in respect of the 2008/2009 income year and succeeding income years up to the 2018/2019 income year. 4. The Commissioner must publish a list of the classes of persons who are considered likely to have had a relationship with the deceased person such that they are likely to be best placed to confirm an income statement of the person. 5. In compiling the classes of persons, the Commissioner has made reference to section 65 of the Administration Act 1969 which prescribes the persons that may be paid any monies that are owing to a deceased person and there is no executor or administrator having been appointed. 6. Going forward from 1 April 2019, income statements are to be replaced with a new regime in which Inland Revenue will calculate the tax liability or refund for a person who is in receipt of “reportable income” which includes a PAYE income payment and a payment of resident passive income. Under s 22F of the TAA 1994, if the person earns income other than reportable income, they will be required to advise Inland OS 19/02: 04/04/2019 3 UNCLASSIFIED Revenue of this so a correct assessment of the tax to pay or refund due can be issued. 7. Where the person is deceased, the executor or administrator of the estate will be able to supply information of income and expenses on behalf of the deceased. However, like the situation with the confirmation of an income statement, where a person has died without a will and no executor or administrator has been appointed, it would be questionable whether relatives are permitted to supply the information to finalise the tax account of the deceased. 8. To avoid doubt, s s 22F(5) and (6) of the TAA 1994 provide that the Commissioner must publish a list of the classes of persons who are considered likely to have a relationship with the deceased person such that they are likely to be best placed to provide income information on behalf of a deceased person. 9. As with s RZ 15 of the ITA 2007, the classes of persons that are able to provide income information on behalf of a deceased person are based on those prescribed in section 65 of the Administration Act 1969. Operational practice 10. A person who wishes to confirm an income statement of a deceased person or wants to provide information to the Commissioner to finalise the tax account of a deceased person must complete the form IR 625 , available on the Inland Revenue website.

UNCLASSIFIED Operational statement OS 19/03 Square metre rate for the dual use of premises Introduction Operational statements set out the Commissioner’s view of the law for the matters discussed and deal with operational issues arising out of the administration of the Revenue Acts. The Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 introduced a new section DB 18AA into the Income Tax Act 2007 1 . This St atement explains how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) will interpret and apply this new section and provides a number of examples of the legislation’s practical application. Unless otherwise stated, all legislative references in this Statement are to the Income Tax Act 2007. Application This Statement applies from 4 July 2019, the date that the Statement was signed. The Statement appears in Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 31, No 7 (August 2019) and on Inland Revenue’s website, www.ird.govt.nz 2 . Background 1. Business owners, especially small business owners, often use their private residence for both business and private purposes. This business use may give rise to deductions that can be claimed by the business owner. However, because there are numerous individual expense items that need to be recorded and apportioned between business and personal use, calculating the quantum of any deductible expenditure can create a large compliance obligation compared with the amount of tax at stake. As stated in the commentary to the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill, the purpose of s DB 18AA is to allow taxpayers to use a simplified method for the calculation of deductions for premises ... that are used for both business and personal purposes. This will reduce compliance costs for taxpayers. 2. The square metre rate option provides a simplified process that removes the requirement for a taxpayer to: • Keep detailed records of the utility costs (electricity, gas, home and contents insurance, telephone, mobile and internet charges) incurred on their private residence, and 1 This section was subsequently amended by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 (2019/5). Royal Assent: 18 March 2019. 2 Search term: OS 19/03 (Technical results) 2 UNCLASSIFIED • Apportion these utilities costs between the business and private use of their residence. Premises costs (mortgage interest, rates and rent) are still required to be claimed based on the business proportion of the actual expenditure incurred by the taxpayer. A taxpayer using this simplified process is not able to claim deductions in respect of any other expenditure (or depreciation loss) that they may have incurred in respect of their private residence. 3. In order to avail themselves of the square metre rate option a taxpayer firstly calculates the percentage of their private residence that is used primarily for business purposes. Using this calculation, they then calculate the available deduction for both the utilities and premise costs that they have incurred. 4. There are no restrictions on the use of this simplified method for calculating the deduction available for the business use of a taxpayer’s private premises, nor is its use mandatory. If a taxpayer chooses not to claim a deduction using the simplified calculation method allowed by s DB 18AA (because, for instance, they wish to claim for expenditure that is not included in the square metre rate calculation), they may still be able to claim a deduction based on: • the business proportion of the actual amounts of expenditure outlaid on their pri vate residence. Note that if a taxpayer chooses to make a claim based on their actual expenses, the Commissioner would expect them to use the methodology set out in this statement to calculate the area of their private residence that is used primarily for business purposes, or • the expenditure apportionment methods set out in Interpretation Statement IS 17/02 Income Tax – Deductibility of farmhouse expenses 3 , if the private residence is a farmhouse. Discussion 5. Section DB 18AA 4 provides a calculation methodology for determining the amount able to be deducted by a taxpayer to take into account the business use of their private residence. There are three steps required to calculate the amount of the deduction. 6. The first step is to calculate the area of the buildings on the premises used primarily for business purposes. In this step the taxpayer determines the area of their buildings (in square metres) that are both separately identifiable parts of the buildings on the premises and that are used primarily for business purposes. This dual calculation results in the identification of the business square metres. The business square metres are then multiplied by the square metre rate to give the first part of the deduction amount. This first step is further discussed at \[13\] – \[26\]. 7. Per \[6\], the business square metres are multiplied by the square metre rate to give the first part of the deduction amount. The square metre rate is: 3 A copy of this Interpretation Statement is available on the Inland Revenue website. Search term: farmhouse (Technical results) 4 See Appendix for a copy of this legislation 3 UNCLASSIFIED • set by the Commissioner, based on the national average annual cost of utilities per square metre of housing, but excluding mortgage interest and rates or rent, and • updated each year. The square metre rate is further discussed at \[ 21\] – \[25\]. 8. The second step is to calculate the business proportion of total premises costs. The starting point for this second step is the business square metres that were calculated at \[6\]. The business square metres are divided by the total area of all the buildings on the premises. The result of this calculation is known as the business proportion and is expressed as a percentage. This percentage is then applied to the total premise costs of all the buildings and their curtilage on the premises to provide the second part of the deduction amount for the square metre rate method. This second step is further discussed at \[ 27\] – \[36\]. 9. The total premises costs are the total amount of actual mortgage interest, rates and rent that the taxpayer has paid for their residential premises in the income year. The reason this part of the deduction is calculated separately from the Commissioner’s square metre rate is because annual mortgage interest, rates and rental costs are too variable for a meaningful national average to be produced. 10. The third step in the calculation involves the amounts calculated at steps 1 and 2 above being added together to give the total amount of the deduction. 11. Note that where a taxpayer chooses to use the square metre rate method, no other deduction in relation to their residential premises can be claimed. 12. To fully understand the calculation methodology that has been outlined in the above 3 step approach, it is necessary that the calculation and some of the words and phrases used in the legislation are explained further. The first step 13. The desired outcome of the first step of the calculation is to identify the business square metres and apply this to the annual square metre rate that is published by the Commissioner. To complete this first step a taxpayer must determine the area of their buildings (in square metres) that are both separately identifiable parts of the buildings on the premises and that are used primarily for business purposes; the business square metres. Multiplying the business square metres by the Commissioner’s square metre rate provides the first element of the square metre rate deduction available to a taxpayer. Separately identifiable parts of the buildings on the premises ... 14. For an area to be separately identifiable it does not need to be physically separate from any other area. It does not, for example, have to be enclosed by walls. It is not a room by room test, but merely looks to identify those parts of the buildings that are separately identifiable as being used for a business purpose. 15. The use of the phrase separately identifiable means that it needs to be obvious that a particular area is “identifiable” as being used for a business purpose that is separate from any other purpose. Whether an area meets this test is considered objectively. It is a positive test, in that the area cannot, objectively, be identifiable as being used for another purpose (a private purpose, for instance), or for a 4 UNCLASSIFIED “neutral” purpose; that is, for no particular identifiable purpose. This is discussed further at Steps 2 and 3, at \[17\] below. 16. In practical terms, it will be easier to see that an area of a building is separately identifiable as an area being used for a business purpose if it has a business asset of some kind within it (computer, business records, inventory for instance) that marks out that area in some way. 17. The Commissioner suggests that a taxpayer take the following step by step approach to this identification process: Step 1: Identify an area (or areas) which may have a business purpose (a potential business area). Step 2: Ignore any part of that potential business area that cannot be used for a business purpose. Generally, this will be because that area is set aside for a non-business purpose. In the context of a family home, this will usually be for a private purpose. Step 3: Would it be obvious to a reasonable person that all the area that remains is separately identifiable as being used for a business purpose? If not, is there a smaller area that is “separately identifiable” as being used for this purpose? For instance, does part of the remaining area have a “neutral” purpose? For example, it may simply be an empty space or a traffic area that is passed through, rather than being “used” for any particular purpose, either business or non-business. The following example illustrates this three-step approach to identifying those areas that are “separately identifiable” parts of the buildings on the premises used for business purposes: Identifying an area that is “separately identifiable” Many modern homes have an open plan living area that includes the kitchen, dining and communal living areas. Where part of this area is used for business purposes, it is necessary to calculate how much of this space is being used for business purposes. Per \[17\], the first step is to identify an area (or areas) which may have a business purpose (the potential business area). In this example, this will be the entire open plan living space. The second step is to ignore any part of that potential business area that cannot be used for a business purpose. That is, those parts of the open plan living space that are clearly used for a private purpose; the area taken up with household furniture and appliances and the area required for the furniture and appliances to be used. Removing from further consideration the area identified at step 2, the third step asks, would it be obvious to a reasonable person that all the area that remains is separately identifiable as being used for a business purpose? In answering this question we need to exclude so much of the remaining area that is used for neither a business nor private purpose. Generally, this will be areas that are 5 UNCLASSIFIED used as “traffic” areas; parts of the open plan living space that are used to get from one area to another. It will also include any areas that are not used at all, areas that are simply empty spaces. The area that remains is the area that is separately identifiable as being for a business purpose. This will generally equate to the space used to physically store any business furniture/equipment and the area that is required to use that furniture/equipment. We now test whether that area is used primarily for business purposes. ... that are used primarily for business purposes 18. To identify the business square metres, a taxpayer must first determine the area of the buildings on the premises (in square metres) that are both separately identifiable parts of these buildings (per \[14\] – \[17\]) and that are used primarily for business purposes. 19. In the context of this legislation the word primarily takes its ordinary meaning, for the most part, mainly 5 . The Commissioner accepts that a part of the premises can be said to be used primarily for a business purpose when it is used for a business purpose (rather than any other purpose) more than 50% of the time. 20. The area that is identified by following the 3- step process (at \[17\] ) and that is also used primarily for business purposes, is the business square metres for the purposes of the s DB 18AA calculation. Square metre rate 21. The business square metres is multiplied by the square metre rate that is published by the Commissioner 6 . This square metre rate will be set and published by the Commissioner on an annual basis. 22. The square metre rate is set by using information obtained from Statistics New Zealand. The Commissioner uses this information to calculate the national average, annual cost of utilities for the average sized New Zealand household. For the purposes of the square metre rate calculation, “utilities” are limited to gas/electricity, telephone/mobile/internet services, and house/contents insurance costs. To arrive at the final square metre rate, this average cost of utilities is divided by the average square metre size of a New Zealand house 7 . 23. Annual mortgage interest, rates or rental costs are excluded from the national, averaging methodology of the square metre rate calculation. This is because, unlike utilities costs these costs are too variable to be included with any accuracy and are best left for a taxpayer to include separately in the second step of the deduction calculation. See \[27\] – \[36\] for further discussion. 24. Those taxpayers who use the square metre rate are not able to claim deductions in respect of any other expenditure (or depreciation loss) that they may have incurred on their private residence. 5 Concise Oxford English dictionary, eleventh edition, revised. 6 S DB 18AA(5) 7 From information available from Quotable Value Limited 6 UNCLASSIFIED 25. For the purposes of section DB 18AA(5), the Commissioner has advised that the square metre rate for the 2017 – 2018 income year is $41.10 per square metre and $41.70 per square metre for the 2018 – 2019 income year. A copy of these determinations and the notes to them can be found on the IR website 8 . 26. The first step of the s DB 18AA calculation is completed by multiplying the business square metres (per \[ 20\]) by the square metre rate that has been set and published by the Commissioner for the income year in question. The second step 27. The desired outcome of the second step is the identification of the business proportion and applying this to the total premise costs of the buildings and their curtilage on the premises. The result of this calculation provides the second element of the square metre rate deduction available to a taxpayer. The business proportion 28. The business proportion is calculated by dividing the total area of all the buildings on the taxpayer’s premises by the business square metres that was calculated previously (at \[20\]) and expressing the result as a percentage. Example of calculating the business proportion Total area of all the buildings on the taxpayer’s premises = 150 square metres. Business square metres = 10 square metres. 10 x 100 150 1 = 6.7% In this example the business proportion is 6.7% When undertaking this calculation, the following definitions are relevant: Buildings 29. What constitutes a building is discussed in Interpretation Statement IS 10/02 – Meaning of “building” in the depreciation provisions (IS 10/02). In summary, IS 10/02 states that a building: • is a structure of considerable size; • is permanent in the sense that it is intended to last a considerable time; • is permanent in the sense that it is designed to be located permanently on the site where it stands. A building is fixed to the land on which it stands. However, a building need not be legally part of the land on which it stands; • is enclosed by walls and a roof; • can function independently of any other structure. However, a building is not necessarily a physically separate structure. 8 Search term: square metre rate (Technical results) 7 UNCLASSIFIED 30. To arrive at the business proportion requires the calculation of the total area of all the buildings on the taxpayer’s property. This will often include buildings other than the taxpayer’s residence. For instance, it is the Commissioner’s view that a standalone garage is a building, but that many small residential garden sheds are too small to be considered buildings; they are structures 9 . It is relatively common that a taxpayer’s premises will include a dwelling and a standalone garage. Where this is the case, the area of both the dwelling and the garage needs to be included in the calculation, whether or not there is any business use of the garage. 31. There is more information on this topic in IS 10/02. This can be found on the IR website 10 . Premises 32. For the purposes of DB 18AA, “premises” is a reference to the taxpayer’s entire property. In an urban, residential setting this will generally equate to the buildings and their curtilage, though this may not be the case in a rural setting. The question of what constitutes curtilage is further discussed at \[34\] and \[35\]. Total premise costs 33. Total premise costs are arrived at by adding together any amount of mortgage interest, rates or rent that the taxpayer has paid in respect of “the buildings and their curtilage on the premises” in the income year. These costs are then multiplied by the business proportion (see \[28\] ) to arrive at the premise costs. As previously explained, the reason that these expenses are not considered at step 1 is because these costs are to o variable for a national average to be struck with any accuracy. Curtilage 34. In the phrase the “buildings and their curtilage on the premises” the word “curtilage” takes on its usual meaning; an area of land attached to a house and forming one enclosure with it; a small court, yard, or piece of ground attached to a dwelling house and forming one enclosure with it (Concise Oxford English dictionary, 11 th edition) 11 . 35. For an urban, residential property, the Commissioner accepts that the buildings and their curtilage will likely equate to the area of the entire property; the premises. In a rural setting, what constitutes the curtilage will be a matter of fact (viewed objectively) in each case but bearing in mind the above definition. 36. The second step of the s DB 18AA calculation is completed by multiplying the total premise costs (at \[33\]) by the business proportion percentage ( at \[28\]). The third step 37. The third and final step in calculating the quantum of the deduction available under s DB 18AA is to add the amount calculated under the first step (at \[26\]) with the amount calculated under the second step of the calculation (at \[36\]). For those 9 IS 10/02, at \[126\] 10 Search term: meaning of building (Technical results) 11 See also Black’s Law Dictionary, 2 nd edition: The curtilage of a dwelling is a space, necessary and convenient and habitually used for the family purposes, and the carrying on of domestic employments. It includes the garden, if there be one, and it need not be separated from other lands by fence (State v. Shaw, 31 Me. 523; Com. v. Rarney, 10 Cush. (Mass.) 480; Derrickson v. Edwards, 29 N. J. Law, 474. SO Am. Dec. 220; 8 UNCLASSIFIED taxpayers that wish to use s DB 18AA, this is the amount that they can claim as a deduction. Part year claims and changes in circumstances 38. By taking account of annualised costs, t he amount calculated in the third step presupposes that the business area is used primarily for business purposes for the entire year, and the area used primarily for business purposes does not change at some time during the year. Where this is not the case and the business area and/or the primary use of that area changes, the amount of the deduction will need to be adjusted to take these changed facts into account. 39. The Commissioner accepts that any adjustment required can be completed based on the number of complete weeks that the separately identifiable area is used primarily for business purposes; the apportionment does not need to be completed on a daily basis. Calculating the adjustment for a part year For instance, if the business area is used for only 32 weeks in a year, the adjustment required would be: Available deduction (after completing the 3-step calculation at \[26\], \[36\] and \[37\])/52 x 32 40. A similar adjustment calculation will be required when the size of the business area alters during the year. For instance, the separately identifiable area that is used primarily for business purposes may change from 6 square metres at the beginning of the year to 9 square metres during week 16. In this case 2 part-year calculations will be required; the first for the initial 15-week period and the second for the remaining 37 weeks. Both calculations start by applying the three-step process to arrive at the initial annual deduction amounts. Each calculation is then adjusted by using the part year calculation shown at \[39\]. Calculating the adjustment when the size of the business area alters In respect of the example used in this paragraph, the full calculations would be as follows: Available annual deduction for first 15-week period (after completing the 3-step calculation at \[26\], \[36\] and \[37\])/52 x 15 = A Available annual deduction for second 37-week period (after completing the 3- step calculation at \[26\], \[36\] and \[37\])/52 x 37 = B 9 UNCLASSIFIED This Operational Statement is signed by me on 4 July 2019 Rob Wells Manager, Technical Standards, OCTC 10 UNCLASSIFIED Example 1: Use of garage for storage Background Because of a lack of suitable, secure storage facilities at her business premises, the taxpayer stores excess inventory along one wall of a separate double garage at her residential address. Also stored in this garage are personal items; the family motor vehicle, children’s bikes, gardening equipment and miscellaneous boxes of personal items. No other part of the taxpayer’s residence is used for business purposes. The taxpayer has calculated the quantum of all interest and rates payments on the property to be $22,000.00 for the year ended 31 March 2019. The total area of all the buildings on the premises is the 35 square metre separate double garage and a 180 square metre dwelling – a total of 215 square metres. Calculating the business square metres Separately identifiable parts of the buildings on the premises... Although the potential area of business use is the entire 35 square metre garage, a 20 square metre area is used to store the family’s personal effects and can therefore never be used for business purposes. Of the remaining 15 square metres, the taxpayer believes that a reasonable person would see the area that is separately identifiable as being used primarily for business purposes, as that area that physically stores the inventory (7 square metres) together with the area immediately surrounding the inventory that allows access to it. She calculates this to be a total area of 9 square metres 12 . The remaining 6 square metres is either empty space or traffic areas. ...that are used primarily for business purposes Given that the sole use of the 9 square metre area is to either store or access the inventory, this area can be said to be primarily used for business purposes. In this example the area that can be said to be used primarily for business purposes and is the business square metres is 9 square metres. Step 1 The first step in the calculation process is completed by multiplying the 9 square metres (the business square metres) by the amount of the Commissioner’s square metre rate for the year in question; in this case the year ended 31 March 2019. This provides the taxpayer with the first component of their deduction. For the year ended 31 March 2019 the Commissioner’s square metre rate was $41.70. 12 The remaining area (6 square metres) is not “separately identifiable” as being for any specific purpose, either business or personal, it is simply either an empty space or a traffic area. 11 UNCLASSIFIED In this example the calculation of the amount of deduction available under step 1 is: 2019 Commissioner’s square metre rate x the business square metres $41.70 x 9 = $375.30 In this example the amount of deduction available under step 1 is $375.30 Step 2 This step calculates the amount of premise costs (mortgage interest, rates or rent) that can be allowed as a deduction. This deduction is calculated by taking the percentage of the premises that is used primarily for business use; the business proportion and applying this percentage to the premise costs; in this case $22,000.00 in interest and rate payments that have been made by the taxpayer. Following the calculation at \[28\], \[33\] and \[36\], the information required to arrive at the deduction available at step 2 is: The total area of all of the buildings on the taxpayer’s premises 215 sq. metres Business square metres (from Step 1) 9 sq. metres Premise costs $22,000.00 These facts are then applied to the following formula: 9 x 100 215 1 = 4.2% x $22,000.00 = $924.00 In this example the amount of deduction available under step 2 is $924.00 Step 3 The final deduction is calculated by combining the results of the first two steps. In this example the total amount of the square metre rate deduction is: $375.30 + $924.00 = $1299.30 12 UNCLASSIFIED Example 2: Use of dedicated home office Mr and Mrs Smith have a small room in their home which they use as an office. The room is furnished with a desk that holds a computer and printer, a computer chair, and filing cabinets that holds business records and stationery. The computer is used daily by the Smiths to update the business accounts but also occasionally for private purposes. Their daughter sometimes uses the computer and printer to complete university assignments. However, she has her own laptop for day-to-day use. The Smiths have calculated the quantum of all interest and rates payments on their property to be $18,700.00 for the year ended 31 March 2019. The total area of the Smith’s dwelling is 160 square metres (inclusive of an attached single garage). There are no other buildings on the property. Calculating the business square metres Separately identifiable parts of the buildings on the premises... The area of the room is 8 square metres, with the desk, chair and filing cabinets taking up approximately 4 square metres of this space. When looking objectively at the room, the Smiths believe that a reasonable person would view the whole of the room as being separately identifiable as being used for business purposes. They have reached this conclusion because all of the room is available for business use (in that none of the area is used solely for a non-business purpose) and the area of the room is small enough so that none of the area can be said to have no specific purpose; the whole room is either taken up by the furniture or allows the furniture to be accessed and used. ...that are used primarily for business purposes Other than for record storage, the separately identifiable area (in this case, the 8 square metre room) is mainly used for computer work by members of the Smith family. While their daughter occasionally uses the computer for university assignments, and the Smiths sometimes use the computer for private purposes, this occasional use is outweighed by the everyday use of the computer for business purposes. As the use of the computer is the primary use of the separately identifiable area, and the computer is used primarily for business purposes, the separately identifiable area can be said to be used primarily for business purposes. In this example the area that can be said to be used primarily for business purposes and is the business square metres is 8 square metres. Step 1 The first step in the calculation process is completed by multiplying the 8 square metres (the business square metres) by the amount of the Commissioner’s square metre rate for the year in question; in this case the year ended 31 March 2019. This provides the taxpayer with the first component of her deduction. 13 UNCLASSIFIED In this example the calculation of the amount of deduction available under step 1 is: 2019 Commissioner’s square metre rate x the business square metres $41.70 x 8 = $333.60 In this example the amount of deduction available under step 1 is $333.60. Step 2 This step calculates the amount of premise costs (mortgage interest, rates or rent) that cam be allowed as a deduction. This deduction is calculated by taking the percentage of the premises that is used primarily for business use; the business proportion and applying this percentage to the premise costs. In this case $18,000.00 in interest and rate payments that have been made by the Smiths. Following the calculation at \[28\], \[33\] and \[36\], the information required to arrive at the deduction available at step 2 is: The total area of all of the buildings on the taxpayer’s premises 13 160 sq. metres Business square metres (from Step 1) 8 sq. metres Premise costs $18,700.00 These facts are then applied to the following formula: 8 x 100 160 1 = 5% x $18,700.00 = $935.00 In this example the amount of deduction available under step 2 is $935.00 Step 3 The final deduction is calculated by combining the results of the first two steps. In this example the total amount of the square metre rate deduction is: $333.60 + $935.00 = $1268.60 13 For the purposes of s DB 18AA the word premises includes building curtilage. For urban, residential properties the Commissioner accepts that the area of building and curtilage on the property will equate to the area of the entire property. See further at \[34\] and \[35\] 14 UNCLASSIFIED Example 3: Use of a main living area As with many contemporary homes, the residence occupied by Mr and Mrs Jones and their two teenage children has a living area that is “open plan”; it includes the kitchen, dining room and lounge. This open plan living area accounts for approximately 50 square metres of the total floor area. Mr and Mrs Jones need to regularly undertake business related work from their home and have located a computer desk, chair and filing cabinets in one corner of this open plan area for this purpose. When not being used for business purposes, the computer is available for the private use of the family. Mr and Mrs Jones have calculated the quantum of all interest and rates payments on their property to be $26,300.00 for the year ended 31 March 2019. The total area of the Smith’s dwelling is 155 square metres (inclusive of an attached single garage). There are no other buildings on the property. Calculating the business square metres Separately identifiable parts of the buildings on the premises... When looking objectively at the open plan living area, Mr and Mrs Jones note that although the potential area of business use is the 50 square metre open plan living area, the majority of this area could not be said to be “separately identifiable” as being available to be used for business purposes. The majority of this large area is used exclusively as the family’s personal living space (35 square metres). Of the remaining area (15 square metres), 9 square metres is not used for either a business or private purpose. It is either empty space or traffic area. The computer desk, chair and filing cabinets take up 4 square metres of the 50 square metre living area. In their view, the area that is “separately identifiable” as being used for a business purpose is that area taken up by the computer desk, chair and cabinets, together with the area that immediately surrounds this furniture that allows it to be used. In total they estimate this to be the remaining area of 6 square metres. ...that are used primarily for business purposes The separately identifiable 6 square metre area is largely used for either business or private computer work by members of the Jones family. While they sometimes use the computer for private purposes, this use is minimal compared to the computer’s everyday business use. All members of the family prefer to use other means to access the internet; the teenagers use their smartphones and x-boxes, and Mr and Mrs Jones generally use their smartphones. Because the use of the computer is the primary use of the separately identifiable area, and the computer is used primarily for business purposes, the separately identifiable area (6 square metres) can be said to be used primarily for business purposes. In this example the area that can be said to be used primarily for business purposes and is the business square metres is 6 square metres. Step 1 The first step in the calculation process is completed by multiplying the 6 square 15 UNCLASSIFIED metres (the business square metres) by the amount of the Commissioner’s square metre rate for the year in question; in this case the year ended 31 March 2019. This provides the taxpayer with the first component of their deduction. For the year ended 31 March 2019 the Commissioner’s square metre rate was $41.70. In this example the calculation of the amount of deduction available under step 1 is: 2019 Commissioner’s square meter rate x the business square metres $41.70 x 6 = $250.20 In this example the amount of deduction available at step 1 is $250.20. Step 2 This step calculates the amount of premise costs (mortgage interest, rates or rent) that can be allowed as a deduction. This deduction is calculated by taking the percentage of the premises that is used primarily for business use; the business proportion and applying this percentage to the premise costs. In this case $26,300.00 in interest and rate payments that have been made by the Jones family. Following the calculation at \[28\], \[33\] and \[36\], the information required to arrive at the deduction available at step 2 is: The total area of all of the buildings on the taxpayer’s premises 155 sq. metres Business square metres (from step 1) 6 sq. metres Premise costs $26,300.00 These facts are then applied to the following formula: 6 x 100 155 1 = 3.9% x $26,300.00 = $1025.70 In this example the amount of deduction available under step 2 is $1025.70. Step 3 The final deduction is calculated by combining the results of the first two steps. In this example the total amount of the square metre rate deduction is: $250.20 + $1025.70 = $1275.90 16 UNCLASSIFIED Example 4: Use of a spare bedroom Following on from Example 3, time has moved on and one of the Jones teenagers has moved out of the house and gone flatting. As one of the bedrooms is now vacant, the Jones decide to move some of the furniture out to the garage and move the computer desk, chair and filing cabinets into this bedroom. They retain some bedroom furniture in the room in case they have quests (or the teenager returns). The area of the bedroom is 12 square metres. As with Example 3, the computer is available for both business and personal use. Calculating the business square metres Separately identifiable parts of the buildings on the premises... The retained bedroom furniture (bed, bedside cabinet, chest of drawers and wardrobe) take up approximately 5 square metres of the 12 square-metre room. The computer desk, chair and filing cabinets take up 4 square metres (the same as it did when these were situated in the living area of the house). T he 5 square metre area of the room taken up by the bedroom furniture could not be said to be “separately identifiable” as being available to be used for business purposes; its use is as a personal living space and therefore not available for business use. The area that is “separately identifiable” as being used for a business purpose is that area taken up by the computer desk, chair and filing cabinets (4 square metres), together with the area that immediately surrounds this furniture that allows it to be used. Mr and Mrs Jones estimate this to be an area of 6 square metres. Note: Although this is the same area that was separately identifiable when this furniture was situated in the family’s open plan living area (at example 3), this is merely a coincidence. The principle to be taken from this is that in what room the furniture is situated is generally not relevant in deciding how much of an area can be said to be “separately identifiable” as being used for business purposes; it is a matter of objective fact in each case. ...that are used primarily for business purposes The facts regarding the use of the computer have not changed from Example 3; it is primarily used for business purposes. Because the use of the computer is the primary use of the separately identifiable area, and the computer is used primarily for business purposes, the separately identifiable area can be said to be used primarily for business purposes. In this example the area that can be said to be used primarily for business purposes and is the business square metres remains as it was in example 3; 6 square metres As the business square metres, the business proportion and the premise costs applicable to the Jones’s residence has not altered from example 3, the quantum of the square metre rate deduction remains as it was in example 3. 17 UNCLASSIFIED APPENDIX LEGISLATION Premises or land costs DB 18AA Square metre rate method When this section applies (1) A person may choose to apply this section to determine the amount of a deduction, in an income year, for the proportion of business use of premises that is used partly for business purposes and partly for other purposes.

Page 1 UNCLASSIFIED Operational Statement OS 19/05 Employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace – income tax (PAYE) and fringe benefit tax Operational statements set out the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s view of the law in respect of the matter discussed and deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. All legislative references in this Statement are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless specified otherwise. Introduction The Commissioner is aware that there has been significant uncertainty regarding whether employer-provided travel 1 from home to a distant workplace is subject to income tax, so PAYE must be deducted, or to fringe benefit tax (FBT). This Statement addresses whether this type of travel is subject to tax and outlines the approach to the tax treatment in this area which the Commissioner will, on a prospective basis, accept as correct. To reduce uncertainty and foster taxpayer compliance, the Commissioner has deliberately sought to take a pragmatic approach as far as this is possible within the law. In this Statement: • employer-provided travel means: o travel an employer organises; o travel that an employee organises but an employer pays for; o travel that an employer reimburses an employee for; or o an allowance paid to an employee by their employer that is paid to cover the cost of travel to a distant workplace; • home means a dwelling you use as a residence; • hometown means the city or town where your home is located; and • a distant workplace is a workplace that is not within reasonable daily travelling distance of the employee’s home. 2 When an employer physically provides the travel or pays for it directly, then that travel may be subject to FBT, which the employer must pay. 1 Travel can be, for example, by car, taxi, plane, bus or train. 2 See also “Guidance on ‘Reasonable Daily Travelling Distance’”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 9 (December 2009): 6; www.classic.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/general-articles/leg-2009- guidance-reasonable-distance.html Page 2 UNCLASSIFIED If the employee is provided with an allowance or is reimbursed in relation to the cost of the travel, then the employer may have to deduct and pay PAYE in relation to that payment. We are aware that many employers and employees are uncertain about when employer-provided travel to a distant workplace is subject to tax. Indeed, some employers have been treating all employer-provided travel to a distant workplace as not taxable. This Statement addresses that uncertainty by setting out the Commissioner’s approach to determining whether employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace is subject to either income tax or FBT or not taxed. Summary of approach 1. Payments made by an employer in relation to a private expense of an employee are usually subject to tax. The cost of home-to-work travel is generally private expenditure as it is incurred so an employee can get to work. As this expenditure is usually private, if the employer provides 3 the employee’s travel from home to work the starting point is that it is taxable. Inland Revenue’s approach Employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace will be taxable (and subject to FBT or income tax) unless one of the following applies: • the travel is one-off or very occasional (de minimis applies); • the travel relates to a temporary posting or secondment (up to two years); • the employee also genuinely works at a hometown workplace; • the employee works from home on specified days (home being their place of work on those days, and the travel relates to one of those days). 2. However, the courts have recognised that some travel from home to work is not taxable because the expenditure relates to travel that is “on work”. 3. This means not all employer-provided travel from an employee’s home to work is taxable, and an employer who provides travel from home to a distant workplace must consider whether that travel is subject to tax. 4. Where an employer physically makes available or directly pays for an employee’s travel from home to a distant workplace, the travel may be subject to FBT, which the employer must pay. 5. If the employee is provided with an allowance or is reimbursed in relation to the travel, that amount may be subject to income tax. If an allowance or reimbursement is taxable for income tax purposes, then the employer must deduct and pay PAYE in relation to that payment. This is because the 3 In the context of this Statement, “provides” includes pays for directly or indirectly, including by way of a reimbursement or allowance. Page 3 UNCLASSIFIED allowance or reimbursing payment would be “salary or wages” under the PAYE rules. 6. It does not matter whether you are considering whether employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace is subject to FBT or income tax, the test is still effectively the same. 7. We recognise that it can be difficult to determine whether travel provided to employees to enable them to travel to a distant workplace is subject to tax. The following paragraphs set out the Commissioner’s approach to determining whether employer-provided travel from an employee’s home to a distant workplace is subject to tax. Application of the Statement 8. The Commissioner is aware that there has been significant uncertainty regarding employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace, in relation to both the correct interpretation of the law and the appropriate practice. Consequently, the Commissioner has developed an approach to the tax treatment in this area which she will, on a prospective basis, accept as correct. In an effort to reduce uncertainty and foster taxpayer compliance, the Commissioner has deliberately sought to take a pragmatic approach as far as this is possible within the law. 9. Therefore, recognising that some taxpayers may need time to implement this approach the Commissioner does not expect taxpayers to apply this Statement to travel taken before 1 April 2020. However, taxpayers can choose to begin applying the approach outlined in this Statement from the date it is issued if they wish to. 10. Given the uncertainty that has existed, taxpayers do not need to revisit tax positions taken before publication of this Statement, and (in the absence of identified avoidance) the Commissioner will not be doing so. 11. The approach outlined in this Statement does not apply where the travel arrangements have been entered into with a purpose of avoiding tax. 12. When considering the tax treatment of employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace, to the extent that there is inconsistency between this Statement and the Interpretation Statement IS3448 Travel by Motor Vehicle between Home and Work: Deductibility of expenditure and FBT implications, the approach in this Statement is to be followed. Discussion 13. As noted above, if the employer provides the employee’s travel from home to work, the starting point is that it is taxable as either: • income to the employee, so subject to PAYE (see from \[14\]); • a fringe benefit subject to FBT (see from \[25\]). PAYE 14. Payments made by an employer to reimburse an employee for that employee’s private expenditure are generally taxable as income of the employee. This is because these payments reduce the need for the employee to incur those costs themselves. Page 4 UNCLASSIFIED 15. When a reimbursement or allowance is taxable it is included as salary or wages for the purposes of the PAYE rules (s RD 5(8)). This means PAYE must be deducted and paid by the employer to Inland Revenue for that reimbursement or allowance. 16. When a reimbursement or allowance is paid to cover costs for which the employee would be allowed a deduction if the employment limitation on deductions did not exist, then it is not subject to income tax (s CW 17). This means the employer would not have to pay PAYE to Inland Revenue in respect of that reimbursement or allowance. 4 17. Therefore, the issue is whether the cost of the particular travel from the employee’s home to a distant workplace would be deductible to the employee (if employees could claim deductions). 18. A deduction is allowable for expenditure incurred in deriving income or necessarily incurred in the course of carrying on a business for that purpose (s DA 1). But expenditure that is of a private or domestic nature is not an allowable deduction (s DA 2(2)). 19. The general rule is that home-to-work travel is private expenditure as it is expenditure to get to work and reflects the employee’s personal choice as to their home location. 5 The two main reasons for this rule are that the: • cost of home-to-work travel is predominantly determined by the private choices of the employee (where to live, how to get to work); • expense of commencing work is distinguished from expenses while “on work”, and employees are expected to bear the cost of commencing work. 20. This means the starting point is that employer-provided travel from home to work is private expenditure and would not be deductible to the employee (if employees could claim deductions). This is the case even if the employee’s travel is funded by the employer or the employee’s attendance at the workplace is required by the employer. 21. The courts have recognised exceptions to this general rule. 6 The cases relating to deductibility of travel expenditure between home and work have identified four broad factual situations where travel between home and work is regarded as business or work-related travel. These situations are where: • a vehicle is essential for transporting goods or equipment necessary for the performance of employment duties at the home and elsewhere; • the taxpayer carries on an “itinerant occupation” (that is, the taxpayer does not work from a fixed work place, and the home is the taxpayer’s base of operations); 4 Operational Statement OS 19/04b: Commissioner’s statement on using a kilometre rate for employee reimbursement of a motor vehicle explains the acceptable method to establish the tax-exempt portion of an amount paid to an employee as a reimbursement where the employee uses their private motor vehicle in the employer’s business. 5 See, for example, Ricketts v Colquhoun \[1926\] AC 1. 6 See Taylor v Provan \[1975\] AC 194; Garrett v FCT 82 ATC 4,060; FCT v Genys 87 ATC 4,875; Case F72 (1984) 6 NZTC 59,924; Miners v Atkinson \[1995\] STC 58; Kirkwood v Evans \[2002\] STC 231. Page 5 UNCLASSIFIED • the taxpayer is required to be accessible at their home for employment duties and is required to undertake travel in response to emergency calls; • the travel is “on work” travel between two workplaces, one of which is also the taxpayer’s home. 22. It can be seen from the cases that for home-to-work travel to be deductible, the employee must actually undertake work at home. 23. It is not sufficient to establish that the home is or can be a workplace. For expenditure to be deductible, the need for the work to be performed at the home, and, therefore, the need for the travel, must arise from the nature of the work and not from the personal choice or personal circumstances of the taxpayer. 24. In addition, the actual travel must be travel undertaken in the course of performing work (that is, the travel is “on work”). If that is the case, then the cost of that travel is not private expenditure of the employee; rather, it is expenditure that would be deductible if employees were not otherwise prevented from claiming deductions. This means the employer does not have to deduct PAYE in respect of the reimbursement or allowance, and the employee is not liable for income tax on the payments. 7, 8 Fringe benefit tax 25. Where an employer provides travel from a person’s home to their workplace (other than by way of a motor vehicle), the position is that this “benefit” amounts to a “fringe benefit” as it is an “unclassified benefit”. 9 26. This travel will be subject to FBT unless one of the exclusions applies. 27. The Commissioner considers that the only exclusions that might apply in respect of employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace are: • benefits provided instead of exempt allowances (s CX 19); and • benefits provided to enable the performance of duties (s CX 20). 28. Benefits are not fringe benefits to the extent that they replace the need to pay certain exempt allowances (s CX 19(1)). 29. Travel provided by the employer will not be a fringe benefit where that travel is necessary for an employee to undertake their employment duties (s CX 20). 30. It could be argued that travel from home to work is travel that is necessary for an employee to undertake their employment duties. However, s CX 20 implicitly adopts the distinction between travel “on work” and travel “to work”, with s CX 20 relating to circumstances where an employee is travelling “on work”. The purpose behind the original predecessor to 7 To the extent that the payments are a reimbursement of actual costs or an allowance paid to cover the costs of the travel when the employee incurs the costs themselves. If amounts in excess are received by the employee, the excess amount is taxable. 8 See Travel by Motor Vehicle between Home and Work: Deductibility of expenditure and FBT implications (Interpretation Statement IS3448, Inland Revenue, 2004), which discusses the question of determining deductibility of home-to-work travel generally. 9 Travel by employer-provided motor vehicle is discussed from \[33\]. Page 6 UNCLASSIFIED s CX 20 was to exclude from FBT incidental benefits arising to an employee as a result of travelling in the course of their employment and was not intended to exclude home-to-work travel from the coverage of FBT. 31. The Commissioner considers that whether these exemptions apply to employer-provided travel is determined by applying the same test as the one used for determining whether employer-provided travel is subject to income tax, and, therefore, salary and wages for PAYE purposes. 32. This means employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace will be subject to FBT unless the: • need for the work to be performed partly at the home (and, therefore, the need for the travel itself) arises from the nature of the work; and • travel itself is actually “on work”. Motor vehicles 33. A fringe benefit arises in relation to a motor vehicle made available to an employee for private use (s CX 6). This Statement does not replace the FBT on motor vehicle rules. 10 34. However, determining whether travel in an employer-provided motor vehicle from home to a distant work location is private use can be relevant in determining whether a motor vehicle was available for private use and therefore a benefit to the employee under those rules. 35. Using an employer-provided motor vehicle for travel between home and work will not be private use of that motor vehicle for FBT purposes if the: • need for the work to be performed partly at the home (and, therefore, the need for the travel itself) arises from the nature of the work; and • travel itself is actually “on work”. 11 36. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the approach in this Statement can be used in determining whether using an employer-provided motor vehicle (for example, a rental car) to travel from home to a distant workplace is work-related travel and not private use. 37. Note that even if travel between home and work is work-related travel (so that the use of a motor vehicle for that purpose is not private use), the employer must establish that the vehicle is not available for any private use. 12 10 As set out in further detail in Fringe Benefit Tax – Motor Vehicles (Interpretation Statement IS 17/07, Inland Revenue, 2017). 11 Using an employer-provided motor vehicle to travel between home and work is discussed in more detail in Travel by Motor Vehicle between Home and Work: Deductibility of expenditure and FBT Implications (Interpretation Statement IS3448, Inland Revenue, 2004). 12 How FBT applies to motor vehicles is discussed in further detail in Fringe Benefit Tax – Motor Vehicles (Interpretation Statement IS 17/07, Inland Revenue, 2017). In the context of determining whether travel from home to a distant workplace is private use, to the extent that there is inconsistency between this Statement and IS 17/07, the approach in this Statement is to be followed. Page 7 UNCLASSIFIED When employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace is not subject to tax 38. We acknowledge that in the modern working environment employees have more flexibility around where they can live and work than in earlier times. As a result, it can be difficult and costly to determine whether employer- provided travel from an employee’s home to a distant workplace is subject to tax. 39. Bearing that in mind and taking into account the legislation, the case law and the Commissioner’s care and management duties under ss 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Commissioner has developed an approach to make it easier to determine whether employer-provided travel from an employee’s home to a distant workplace is taxable. 40. In arriving at this approach, the Commissioner considered it appropriate to treat temporary travel to a distant workplace as different from more long- term travel arrangements. This is because we recognise that where the requirement for the travel is a temporary one, the cost of the travel is less likely to have been predominantly determined by the private choices of the employee (where to live, how to get to work). Where the travel is temporary, an employee is less likely to have the ability to mitigate the costs arising from the requirement to work at a distant location (by relocating). 41. In relation to determining whether accommodation is subject to tax, Parliament introduced clear rules that treat an arrangement where accommodation is provided for two years or less as temporary. While similar rules have not been enacted in relation to travel, how these rules apply to accommodation at a distant workplace does provide a useful indication of what Parliament considered was an appropriate line to draw between temporary and more permanent arrangements in relation to working at a distant workplace. Summary of approach 42. In summary, the Commissioner’s approach is that travel from home to a distant workplace that is provided by the employer will be taxable (and subject to FBT or income tax) unless one of the following applies: • the travel is one-off or very occasional (de minimis); • the travel relates to a temporary posting or secondment (up to two years); • the employee also genuinely works at a local workplace (meaning they have two workplaces); • the employee works from home on specified days and the travel relates to one of those days. One-off or very occasional travel 43. Inland Revenue considers that one-off or very occasional travel from home to a distant location for work (when required by the employer) can be treated as not taxable on an incidental or de minimis basis. For example, att endance at a two-day conference at a distant location. Page 8 UNCLASSIFIED 44. This approach will apply to employees who work at an office of their employer located in their hometown as well as employees who work all the time from their home. Temporary travel 45. More frequent or ongoing employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace (when the employer requires the travel) can be treated as non- taxable where the requirement for travel is a temporary requirement (which means for a period of two years or less). An example might be a posting or secondment to another office or a client’s premises for a 12-month term (see Example 1). 46. To treat the travel as temporary the employer must be able to show that the parties reasonably expected that the requirement for the travel was for two years or less. Reasonable expectation is initially measured at the time the requirement for the travel arose. The parties’ expectation may be evidenced by the employee’s terms of employment, but in many cases there may not be a written agreement. Other documentation such as board minutes, planning documents, and correspondence may demonstrate the expectation as to length of the secondment. 47. It is possible that travel which is treated as non-taxable can become taxable. If it becomes clear that there is now a reasonable expectation that the requirement for travel is no longer a temporary requirement (for a period of two years or less) that travel will be taxable going forward from the date the expectation changed. 13 48. Equally, if it becomes clear that a requirement for travel which was expected to be more than a temporary requirement is now expected to be a temporary requirement ( a period of two years or less) then that travel can be treated as non-taxable from the date the expectation changed. Example 1: Temporary travel Robyn lives in Auckland but is seconded to a job in Wellington for 12 months. Robyn’s employer agrees to meet the costs of Robyn flying between Auckland and Wellington (and back) every week as well as taxis to and from the airport. As the secondment is for two years or less (in this case, 12 months) any employer-provided travel from home to the distant location can be treated as non-taxable. 13 Not from the end of the original date of the arrangement. Page 9 UNCLASSIFIED Example 2: Temporary travel After 11 months Robyn and her employer agree that she will continue to work in Wellington for another sixteen months. As it is now expected that Robyn will be working in Wellington for more than two years (27 months in total) the travel can no longer be treated as temporary and will be taxable from the date the expectation changed. Ongoing travel from home to a distant workplace 49. Ongoing employer-provided travel from an employee’s home to a distant workplace will be taxable when the travel is for more than two years. This is because Inland Revenue considers that at that stage the arrangement for the travel is more than temporary. (See Example 3 .) Example 3: Ongoing travel from home to a distant workplace Rudolf is a senior manager in a multinational company with its head office in Auckland. Rather than move his family to Auckland, Rudolf negotiated an arrangement whereby his employer provided him with an apartment in Auckland and flies him to Auckland on Monday morning and flies him to Wellington on Friday afternoon. As well as the cost of flights, his employer also covers the cost of his taxi travel to and from Auckland and Wellington airports. The arrangement is for more than two years, so this employer-provided travel is taxable. The outcome would be the same if Rudolf were seconded to the job in Auckland for a period greater than two years (rather than permanently appointed). 50. This approach applies except where the employee has at least two workplaces. Travel between multiple workplaces 51. As noted above, the courts have recognised that travel between two workplaces is not private expenditure when the employer requires that travel. Therefore, where an employee has two (or more) workplaces that they work from, one in their hometown and one distant, the Commissioner considers that the travel from the employee’s home to the distant workplace can be treated as work-related travel (being travel between multiple workplaces) and not taxable (the “multiple workplace approach”). 52. The Commissioner does not require an employee to be travelling from their workplace in their hometown to the distant workplace before treating the travel as being between multiple workplaces. This means the multiple workplace approach can apply when an employee instead travels directly from their home to a distant workplace. The Commissioner has taken this Page 10 UNCLASSIFIED approach to recognise the travel between the multiple workplaces and, at the same time, minimise taxpayer compliance costs. 53. An employer’s workplace in their hometown can still be a workplace of that employee for the purposes of this approach, even if most of the employee’s working week is spent at a distant workplace. (See Examples 4 and 5.) Example 4: Travel between multiple workplaces Jim is employed as a specialist to provide ongoing advice to senior managers. The job was advertised as being based in Wellington, but Jim was not interested in working full time in Wellington because his family lives in Auckland. Jim and the employer agree that Jim can work two days a week in Auckland at the Auckland office and three days a week in Wellington. The employer provides Jim with the travel between his home and the Wellington office. Jim’s travel from home to the Wellington office and back will be travel between two workplaces and not subject to tax. Example 5: Travel between multiple workplaces Charlotte is a manager based in Nelson. She has staff based throughout the country that she visits regularly. She is often required to be in Wellington for meetings. The travel in question is the travel from her home in Nelson to the distant location(s) and back again. Charlotte’s travel to the distant workplaces will be travel between two (multiple) workplaces and not subject to tax. If Charlotte were to use an employer-provided car (such as a rental) to undertake that travel between home and a distant workplace, as the Commissioner is treating the travel as travel between two workplaces it would not be private use for the purposes of determining whether the car was available for private use. Whether home is a workplace for the purposes of the multiple workplaces approach 54. If an employee does not have a workplace that is local to their home, then the travel to a distant workplace can still be travel between two workplaces, but only if their home can be considered to be a workplace. 55. Under the approach outlined in this Statement, the Commissioner will accept that in relation to travel, home can be a workplace for the purposes of the multiple workplace approach. But whether home is actually a workplace depends on the arrangement entered into between the parties, and an employee does not have multiple workplaces just because they can choose to work at home from time to time. Page 11 UNCLASSIFIED 56. The Commissioner notes that by accepting that home could be a workplace in the context of travel to a distant workplace, she is taking a more concessionary approach than Parliament has taken in relation to the question of multiple workplaces and accommodation. Accommodation that an employer provides or pays for can be exempt where the employee has multiple workplaces (section CW 16F). However, where the employee has only two workplaces and one of them is a home office, this approach cannot apply. 57. While home may be a workplace, it is also the employee’s home, so it is easy for the line between home-to-work travel and “on-work” travel to become blurred. This raises the question as to what extent does working from home convert that home to being a workplace for the purposes of the multiple workplace approach. 58. In considering whether a person is travelling between two workplaces when they travel from home to a work location, the courts have said it is not enough that a person can work at home. The courts tend to treat the place where you live as private and require an explicit and demonstrable distinction to exist before treating where you live as anything other than your home. 59. The Commissioner also requires such an explicit and demonstrated connection with home as a workplace on any particular day. If this were otherwise, then a “tainting” issue would arise as to what portion of time working at home in a week would be sufficient for home to be treated as a workplace for the whole week. There is no legal basis for the selection of any particular proportion, and the Commissioner does not believe that the courts would support such an outcome. 60. Accordingly, the Commissioner’s position is that, for the purposes of the multiple workplace approach, home should be regarded as a workplace in this context only in relation to the days where home is contractually and actually the employee’s usual place of work. 61. For an employee whose arrangement requires that they work at home on every working day, home is clearly a workplace. 62. Where an employee’s employment arrangement requires that their home is their formal workplace where they are expected to work on specified days (such as every Monday and Tuesday), their home will be their workplace on those days for the purposes of the multiple workplace approach. However, their home is still home on the other days, and travel from home to a distant workplace in relation to the other days is travel from home to work and is taxable. 63. For a home to be a workplace on any day, the arrangement with the employer must provide that it is a specified day where the employee is required to work at home, rather than the employee simply having the potential to work at home on that day. 64. Where travel from the home to the distant workplace relates to a “working from home day” (being a day when home is a workplace), this travel will be treated as travel between multiple workplaces. 65. On other days, home is still regarded as home, so the travel from home to a distant workplace will generally still be taxed on the basis that it is home to work travel. Page 12 UNCLASSIFIED 66. The Commissioner recognises that this approach could be seen as a constraint on the parties’ contracting arrangements or as a compliance cost. However, she considers it a necessary part of the approach being taken, which is itself an attempt to minimise compliance costs. (See Examples 6–9.) 67. It is important to note that when applying the Commissioner’s approach outlined in this Statement, whether home is a workplace only becomes relevant in determining whether the multiple workplace approach applies. Example 6: Multiple workplace approach - Whether home is a workplace when person is contracted to work from home full time Under Adele’s employment arrangement, she is contracted to work at home on a full-time basis. This means home is usually her sole place of work. Therefore, it can be considered to be her workplace on every work day. As any employer-provided travel from Adele’s home to a distant workplace (for example, for a specific meeting or purpose) is very occasional or could be considered to be one-off, it is not subject to tax. Example 7: Multiple workplace approach - Whether a person has multiple workplaces Ruby lives in Auckland and works for a government agency. She has a permanent working arrangement where she works Monday and Tuesday at home. On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, Ruby works at the agency’s Auckland office. Ruby is seconded to work on a 26-month project that requires her to work in Wellington on Thursday and Friday. As the project is for more than two years, the key question is whether Ruby has at least two workplaces so that the multiple workplace approach applies. As Ruby normally works in the Auckland office on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, any employer-provided travel from Ruby’s home to Wellington in relation to her work in Wellington would be treated as travel between multiple workplaces (the Auckland office and the Wellington workplace). Therefore, the multiple workplaces approach would apply in relation to this particular employer-provided travel and it would not be subject to tax Example 8: Multiple workplace approach - Whether home is a workplace when a person is permitted to work at home Leo lives in Tauranga but the company he works for is based in Auckland. Under his employment contract Leo can work up to two days a week at home in Tauranga. The days that Leo works at home can vary depending on personal and business convenience. Leo’s employer provides him with travel between his home in Tauranga and the Auckland office in the form of plane flights and connecting taxis. Page 13 UNCLASSIFIED This is an ongoing arrangement, so the main question is whether Leo has at least two workplaces so that the multiple workplace approach applies. It is important to determine whether Leo’s home is a workplace. Leo does not have specified days where he works at home, which means the Commissioner will not accept that his home is a workplace for any particular day, for the purposes of the multiple workplaces approach. Therefore, as Leo only has one workplace (the Auckland office) the multiple workplace approach does not apply in relation to this employer- provided travel, which is subject to tax. (If Leo and his employer had a different arrangement where Leo had specified days where he was required to work from home (for example, Monday and Tuesday), then home would be accepted to be Leo’s workplace on those days.) Example 9: Multiple workplace approach - Whether home is a workplace when a person is required to work at specified places on different days Phil is contracted on an ongoing basis to work Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at his home and Thursday and Friday at a distant workplace. This ongoing arrangement is expected to last for more than two years. Therefore, the key question to answer when determining whether this travel to a distant workplace is taxable is whether Phil has at least two workplaces (the possibilities are home and the distant workplace) so that the multiple workplace approach applies. It is important to determine whether home is a workplace. In this circumstance, home is clearly a workplace on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and employer-provided travel to the distant workplace relating to those days will not be taxable. An example of this would be attendance at a conference or meeting on one or more of those days. But on Thursday and Friday Phil does not work from his home, so home is still his home for these purposes on those days. Consequently, employer- provided travel from home to the distant workplace will be travel from home to work (and taxable) when it is undertaken for the purpose of getting Phil to that distant location, so he can work there on Thursday and/or Friday. This means employer-provided travel from his home to a distant workplace on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday will be taxable, if the travel is undertaken so Phil can undertake his work on Thursday and Friday. 68. This Statement applies from 1 April 2020. However, taxpayers may choose to apply it from the date of issue if they wish to do so. Page 14 UNCLASSIFIED 69. If you are unsure how this Statement applies to you, seek guidance from a tax professional. This Statement was signed on 18 December 2019.

[Remedial amendments to the Portfolio Investment Entity tax rules](/new-legislation/act-articles/2007-19/remedial-amendments "Remedial amendments to the Portfolio Investment Entity tax rules")

Other amendments - Income Tax Act 2004
======================================

2007 amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 ensure that the New Zealand Superannuation Fund receives the same treatment as a portfolio investment entity.

Amendments have been made to various sections of the Income Tax Act 2004 to ensure that the New Zealand Superannuation Fund receives the same treatment as a portfolio investment entity.  These include amendments to sections CX 44C(1) and (2) to ensure that the New Zealand Superannuation Fund is not taxed on proceeds from the disposal of shares in New Zealand-resident companies and certain Australian-resident listed companies.

*   Section CX 44D(3)(a)(i) has been amended to remove the reference to zero-rated portfolio investors as this term is not relevant in relation to portfolio listed companies.  The amendment ensures that a natural person, other than a trustee, can elect to treat a distribution from a portfolio listed company as a taxable amount.
*   Section CX 44D(3)(b) has been amended to provide that distributions from portfolio listed companies are not treated as excluded income if the distributions are fully dividend withholding payment credited.  This ensures that non-resident investors in portfolio listed companies are still subject to non-resident withholding tax on dividends which carry full dividend withholding payment credits.  Section NG 1(2)(a) has been consequentially amended to remove a redundant reference.
*   Section HL 8 has been amended to ensure that only portfolio listed companies must attach full imputation credits (to the extent available) to distributions.  The previous wording of section HL 8 could have been interpreted to include other portfolio investment entities, which were not intended to be covered by the provision.
*   Section HL 10(2) has been amended to ensure that portfolio investment entities that derive portfolio investor allocated income from investments in other portfolio investment entities and/or distributions from superannuation funds meet the income type requirement under the eligibility rules.
*   Sections HL 10(3) and (5) have been amended so that they refer to the market value of the underlying investment held, rather than voting interests, in the case of investments in unit trusts.  Before this change, there was an argument that the entity and class shareholding investment requirements could be circumvented for an investment by a portfolio investment entity in a unit trust.
*   Section HL 10(4) has been amended to remove investments in a life insurer from the exception to the entity shareholding investment requirement for a portfolio investment entity.
*   Section HL 12 has been amended to ensure that failures to meet the eligibility requirements under section HL 4 are considered when an entity becomes a portfolio investment entity.
*   Section HL 15 has been amended to allow portfolio tax rate entities that have a portfolio calculation period of a quarter to elect a portfolio allocation period of a month by giving notice to the Commissioner before the start of a tax year or when the entity chooses to become a portfolio tax rate entity.
*   Section HL 16 has been amended to clarify that a portfolio tax rate entity can allocate a portfolio investor interest to an investor for a portfolio allocation period if the investor has an unconditional entitlement to the interest at the end of a vesting period.  The maximum duration of a vesting period, under section HL 16(2)(e)(ii), has also been increased to five years (from three years previously) to align with vesting periods for certain KiwiSaver funds.  
*   Section HL 31 has been amended to require a portfolio investor proxy to provide information to a portfolio investment entity concerning whether the portfolio investor proxy would cause the portfolio investment entity to breach the eligibility criteria.  As a consequence of this amendment, section HL 6(1)(a)(ii) has been removed.
*   Section IG 1(2) has been amended to clarify that the rules for determining which companies are treated as a group of companies do not apply for portfolio tax rate entities, rather than portfolio investment entities generally.  In particular, a portfolio listed company can be included in a group of companies.
*   New section LD 10B is being added to allow a credit to a zero-rated portfolio investor for any income tax paid by a portfolio tax rate entity in relation to the investor's portfolio investor allocated income. 
*   Sections LD 10(2) and LD 11(2) have been amended to ensure that a taxpayer receives as a tax credit the amount of any income tax actually paid by the portfolio tax rate entity, in relation to an amount of portfolio investor allocated income that is not excluded income under section CX 44D(1)(b) or where the income relates to a portfolio investor exit period under section HL 21(5). 
*   Section NG 1(2)(f) has been amended to ensure that distributions from portfolio tax rate entities to non-residents are not subject to further tax through deduction of non-resident withholding tax. 
*   The definition of "income tax liability" has been amended to include income tax that is calculated under subpart HL for a portfolio tax rate entity.
*   The definition of "portfolio investor rate" in section OB 1 has been amended to allow portfolio tax rate entities to apply an updated rate that the investor has provided before the end of the year and use that rate for amounts that the entity has not yet calculated a liability for the purposes of the rules.  The definition has also been amended so the top rate of tax in a portfolio tax rate entity is 30% (instead of 33%).  The latter amendment applies from the 2008-09 and later income years.   
*   The definition of "portfolio land company" has been amended to clarify that a company is considered a portfolio land company if the company owns land or shares in a portfolio land company that comprises 90 percent of the gross assets of the company on 80 percent or more of the days in the income year in which the company has gross assets of more than $100,000.
*   The definition of "portfolio tax rate entity" has been amended so that it refers to a portfolio defined benefit fund and not a defined benefit fund.
*   The definition of "prescribed investor rate" has been amended to clarify that the $60,000 threshold in paragraph (b)(ii) is calculated taking into account both an investor's portfolio investor allocated income and loss.  A further clarification to the definition has been made to provide that the 0% rate applies if the investor is a portfolio investment entity, other than a portfolio investment entity or superannuation fund which has a trustee that has elected a 33% tax rate.  

#### Amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994

*   Section 31B has been amended to ensure that investors in portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under section HL 21 and have a portfolio investor exit period, are issued with information that the Commissioner considers relevant to the exit period, at the end of the month following the quarter in which the exit period ends.  Section 31B has also been amended to provide that portfolio tax rate entities must give a statement to zero-rated portfolio investors on an annual basis only.  References to "income year" have also been changed to "tax year" to better align with core provisions.
*   Section 33A(1)(b) has been amended to ensure that zero-rated portfolio investors (or investors in portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under section HL 21, and have a portfolio investor exit period) receiving small amounts of portfolio investor allocated income do not have to file a return where these amounts, combined with other types of income which have not been correctly taxed at source, is $200 or less.
*   The return filing date for portfolio tax rate entities and portfolio investor proxies in section 57B has been amended to cater for non-standard balance dates.

#### Amendments to other statutes

*   Section 53(2) of the Companies Act 1993 has been amended to correct a cross-referencing error.
*   The Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 has been amended to ensure that entities can make an election to be a portfolio investment entity from 1 April 2007 (although the date that the election is effective will be on or after 1 October 2007).

[Taxation (Personal Tax Cuts, Annual Rates, and Remedial Matters) Act 2008](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-personal-tax-cuts-annual-rates-and-remedial-matters-act-2008 "Taxation (Personal Tax Cuts, Annual Rates, and Remedial Matters) Act 20")

Other policy matters
====================

Policy matters/amendments resulting from the Taxation (Personal Tax Cuts, Annual Rates, and Remedial Matters) Act 2008, including a DTA with the Czech Republic.

A new double tax agreement (DTA) between New Zealand and the Czech Republic has entered into force, bringing New Zealand's total number of DTAs in force to 35. A protocol amending the existing DTA with the United Kingdom has also entered into force. Orders in Council have been made to incorporate into New Zealand law a new tax information exchange agreement with the Netherlands on behalf of the Netherlands Antilles and to add Mexico and Austria to the list of treaty partners approved for the purpose of the "venture capital exemption" in section CW 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. In addition, arrangements for assistance in collection of taxes under the DTA with Australia became effective on 8 September 2008.

### New double tax agreement with the Czech Republic

The new DTA with the Czech Republic is expected to play an important part in facilitating increased bilateral trade and investment. DTAs are designed to provide certainty of tax treatment and to prevent the double taxation of cross-border transactions. By providing for the exchange of information on tax matters, DTAs also play a valuable role in preventing tax avoidance and evasion.

The DTA was signed on 26 October 2007 and incorporated into New Zealand law by Order in Council on 28 July 2008. DTAs do not enter into force until the necessary legal procedures have been completed in both countries. Those procedures have now been completed in both countries, and the agreement entered into force on 2 September 2008. The agreement has effect for New Zealand withholding taxes from 1 January 2009 and for other New Zealand taxes for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2009.

### Protocol amending the existing double tax agreement with the United Kingdom

The protocol with the United Kingdom updates Article 25 "Exchange of information" of the DTA to allow for information exchanges in relation to taxes other than income tax. The protocol also inserts a new article "Assistance in the collection of taxes" into the DTA, to allow the tax authorities of the two countries to request assistance from each other in the collection of tax debt.

The protocol was signed on 7 November 2007. An Order in Council incorporating the protocol into New Zealand law was made on 28 July 2008. The protocol entered into force on 28 August 2008, and its provisions have effect from that date.

### New tax information exchange agreement with the Netherlands on behalf of the Netherlands Antilles

The tax information exchange agreement with the Netherlands will enable the tax authorities of New Zealand and the Netherlands Antilles to exchange information on tax matters in order to assist each other in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and evasion.

The agreement was signed on 1 March 2007 and incorporated into New Zealand law by Order in Council on 1 September 2008. The agreement will enter into force once both countries have completed an exchange of diplomatic notes confirming that all domestic processes for entry into force are complete. This is likely to be complete by the time of publication.

### Austria and Mexico added to the list of approved countries

An Order in Council was made on 1 September 2008 adding Mexico and Austria to the list of approved treaty partners for the purposes of the "venture capital exemption" in section CW 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Order in Council will enter into force on 2 October 2008. From that date, qualifying investors from Austria and Mexico will not be subject to New Zealand tax on gains on the value of shares in certain listed New Zealand companies.

### Assistance in collection under the double tax agreement with Australia

Now it has taken effect, Article 27 "Assistance in collection of taxes" in the DTA with Australia will facilitate cooperation between Australia and New Zealand in the recovery of outstanding tax debt.

A protocol making changes to New Zealand's existing DTA with Australia was signed on 15 November 2005. An Order in Council incorporating the protocol into New Zealand law was made on 26 June 2006. The protocol came into force on 22January 2007 and has effect from that date, except for Article 4, which inserts new Article 27 "Assistance in collection of taxes". The date from which the new assistance in collection article takes effect has now been agreed by the governments of Australia and New Zealand as 8 September 2008.

Other remedial matters
======================

2014 remedial legislation including excepted financial arrangements, income derived from land, the mixed-use asset and loss grouping rules and more.

Excepted financial arrangements
-------------------------------

#### _Section EW 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Technical amendments have been made to section EW 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to clarify the application and effect of the financial arrangement rules to short-term agreements following an earlier change made by the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013.

### Background

Before its amendment by the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013, section EW 8 allowed taxpayers to treat certain agreements and arrangements as falling within the scope of the financial arrangement rules. The election had an unintended consequence of allowing taxpayers to obtain a deduction under the financial arrangement rules for the purchase price connected with acquiring a short-term agreement for sale and purchase in situations when the purchase would be ordinarily classified as being on capital account (and therefore non-deductible). The Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013 amended section EW 8 so that the scope of the election was narrowed - refer to page 44 _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 25, No 9 (October 2013).

In response to a submission on the bill from a life insurer, additional changes have been made to section EW 8 of the financial arrangement rules to clarify the treatment of short-term agreements for sale and purchase. The technical amendments made by the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 reverse elements of the earlier amendment made by the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013.

### Key features

Specifically, the technical amendments:

*   repeal, from 27 September 2012,[1](#01)
     the changes to section EW 8 made by the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013; and
*   retrospectively restore, from 17 July 2013,[2](#02)
     the election permitted under section EW 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007, provided that the expenditure to be spread is on revenue account (that is, it does not rely on the election allowed by section EW 8 to deem the expenditure as on revenue account).

Taxpayers who applied the changes made by the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013 in a return of income or in connection with the determination of a binding ruling made by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue before 14 April 2014, and choose to continue with the tax position, are not affected by retrospective change.

### Application date

The amendment has effect from 27 September 2012.

Spreading of income for income derived from land
------------------------------------------------

#### _Sections EI 7 and EI 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Sections EI 7 and EI 8 provide that certain income derived from land is spread forward evenly over the period of time referred to in those sections.

Transitional provisions apply to income derived before the 2015-16 income year if the taxpayer has previously chosen to apply either section EI 7 or section EI 8. The transitional provisions apply to that unallocated income as follows:

*   If the period of time referred to in those sections has _not_ expired before the start of the 2015-16 income year, that unallocated income is spread evenly over the number of years remaining in that period, beginning with the 2015-16 income year.
*   If the period of time referred to in those sections _has_ expired before the start of the 2015-16 income year, the unallocated income is allocated to the 2015-16 income year.

### Background

Sections EI 7 and EI 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply to taxpayers who derive income from land, either:

*   in the nature of fines, premiums or from a payment of goodwill on the grant of a lease (section EI 7); or
*   as a result of a compulsory disposal of land to the Crown (section EI 8).

Before self-assessment legislation was enacted in 2001, the corresponding provisions to sections EI 7 and EI 8 in the Income Tax Act 1994 allowed taxpayers to elect to spread the income forward. However, this spreading of income was required to follow the Commissioner's practice of spreading forward on an even basis over the number of years stated in the provisions. Following the enactment of self-assessment legislation, taxpayers had a choice to spread that income forward, although not necessarily on an even basis.

The amendments to sections EI 7 and EI 8 clarify that taxpayers may choose to spread the income forward, but the spreading must be on an even basis over the years referred to in both of those sections.

### Application dates

The amendment applies to income derived in the 2015-16 income year and later income years. However, a transitional provision applies to income derived before the start of the 2015-16 income year if the taxpayer has previously chosen to apply either section EI 7 or section EI 8 for that income.

### Detailed analysis

Sections EI 7 and EI 8 provide timing relief for taxpayers who derive income from land in certain circumstances. The provisions permit the taxpayers to spread the income forward evenly across the current and certain future income years instead of returning the income in the year it is derived. This relief applies to income derived either:

*   in the nature of fines, premiums or from a payment of goodwill on the grant of a lease (section EI 7, Income Tax Act 2007); or
*   from a compulsory disposal of land to the Crown (section EI 8, Income Tax Act 2007).

If the taxpayer chooses to allocate the income under either section EI 7 or section EI 8:

*   income derived from land for payments in the nature of fines, premiums or goodwill on the grant of a lease is allocated evenly over the income year the income is derived in and the five immediately succeeding income years; and
*   income derived from a compulsory disposal of land to the Crown is allocated evenly over the income year the income is derived in and the three immediately succeeding income years.

#### _Transitional issues_

Transitional provisions apply to income from land that has been derived:

*   before the 2015-16 income year; and
*   has not been fully allocated at the end of the 2014-15 income year.

In this circumstance, the taxpayer may elect to allocate the unallocated portion of the income evenly to income years from 2015-16 onward, ensuring that the income spread does not exceed the time period referred to in sections EI 7 or E I8.

However if the period of time referred to in the relevant provision has expired before the start of the 2015-16 income year, the taxpayer is required to allocate the unallocated portion of the income to the 2015-16 income year.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 1 | **Transitional effect** |
| The taxpayer has chosen to spread the income derived in the 2011-12 income year from land for payments in the nature of fines, premiums or goodwill on the grant of a lease on an even basis. The policy intention is that this would result in all of that income being allocated evenly over the 2011-12 to 2016-17 income years.<br><br>The transitional rule provides that the amount of income derived in the 2011-12 income year that remains unallocated at the start of the 2015-16 income year is spread evenly over the 2015-16 and 2016-17 income years. |     |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 2 | **Transitional effect** |
| A taxpayer has derived income from a premium on the grant of a lease in the 2008-09 income year. Under section EI 7 it was arguable that the taxpayer could choose to allocate all or some of the income to an income year of choice, for example the 2018-19 income year. The policy intention is that the income should have been spread evenly over each of the 2008-09 to 2013-14 income years.<br><br>The transitional rule provides that the income derived in the 2008-09 income year that remains unallocated at the start of the 2015-16 income year is allocated fully to the 2015-16 income year. This is because the allocation of the income has already been deferred beyond the intended relief period, and therefore should be allocated to the 2015-16 income year. |     |

Remedial amendments to the mixed-use asset rules
------------------------------------------------

#### _Sections DG 6, DG 9, DG 11, DG 16, DG 17 and DZ 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Remedial changes have been made to the mixed-use asset rules in subpart DG and section DZ 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Background

The mixed-use asset rules were introduced as new subpart DG and related provisions by the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013. They are designed to prevent excess deductions being claimed where an asset is used partly to earn income and partly for private purposes - an example of which is a bach that is rented out when the owner is not using it.

The rules apply to land and improvements for the 2013-14 and later income years; and to certain boats and aircraft for the 2014-15 and later income years.

Since the rules were introduced, a number of technical issues have been identified. The following remedial amendments address some of those issues:

*   the specific associated persons rule for mixed-use assets in section DG 6 has been amended to ensure it applies as intended;
*   minor corrections have been made to several examples in the legislation;
*   the depreciation rollover relief provision that applies when a company distributes its mixed-use asset to one or more shareholders in the 2013-14 income year has been amended. This ensures that depreciation recovery income is ultimately crystallised if the shareholder sells the asset for more than its adjusted tax value (taking into account depreciation claimed by the company);
*   the "asset value" for land used in the apportionment formula and the quarantined expenditure provision has been modified to ensure it accurately reflects the true economic value to the taxpayer;
*   the apportionment formula in section DG 9 has been amended to deal with the use of an asset for capital purposes; and
*   the "asset income" definition in section DG 17 has been aligned with the definition of the same term in section DG 16.

These amendments are all consistent with the policy intent of the mixed-use asset rules.

### Key features

#### _Specific associated person rule for mixed-use assets_

The concept of association is key to the mixed-use asset rules. Section DG 6 modifies the general associated persons definition. Specifically, section DG 6(a) deemed a shareholder who holds 5 percent or more of the shares in a company to be associated with that company. It was intended to remove this provision from the bill that introduced the mixed-use asset rules, however it was not removed before enactment. Accordingly, section DG 6(a) has been repealed with application for the 2013-14 and later income years. Section DG 6(b), which deems a shareholder to be associated with a company if the person's share in the company gives them a right to use a mixed-use asset owned by the company, will remain.

#### _Corrections to legislative examples_

Several examples in the earlier legislation contained minor errors. These are summarised below with the corrections made under the new legislation marked-up for emphasis.

| Section | Example and correction | Why correction is needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DG 11 | **Example**  <br>Holiday Home Ltd holds a holiday home with a rateable value of $200,000. The company has debt of $40,000, with associated interest expenditure of $4,000. Since the debt value is less than the asset value, all the interest expenditure must be apportioned (section DG 11(3)). Boat Ltd has a charter boat whose **adjusted tax value** ~cost~ is $60,000. The company has debt of $100,000, with associated interest expenditure of $10,000. Since the debt value is more than the asset value, the company must apportion interest expenditure of $6,000 (section DG 11(4)-(6)). The formula is $10,000 × ($60,000/$100,000) = $6,000. | Under section DG 11(8)(b), the appropriate "asset value" for property other than land is its adjusted tax value, not its cost. |
| DG 16 | **Example**  <br>David has a city apartment with a rateable value of $300,000. He rents out the apartment and also uses it privately. He receives market rate rental of $4,000 from non-associates, and $6,000 from associates. David's total allowable expenditure, under sections DG 7, DG 8 and DG 11, is $15,000. **The income from associates is exempt under section CW 8B, and is ignored. David therefore has asset income of $4,000 and deductions of $15,000, giving rise to an excess of expenditure over income of $11,000**. Since David's income from non-associates is less than 2% of the apartment's rateable value, the excess expenditure of **$11,000** ~$5,000~ is denied as a deduction. The amount denied may be allocated to a later income year under section DG 17. | The excess expenditure in this example is $11,000 not $5,000. The amendment also provides additional explanation of the calculations to assist readers. |
| DG 17 | **Example, continued from section DG 16**  <br>In the following income year, David derives $10,000 from renting his city apartment at market rates to a non-associate. David's total allowable expenditure, under sections DG 7, DG 8, and DG 11, is $8,000. He also has expenditure of **$11,000** ~$5,000~ quarantined from the previous income year. David is able to deduct $2,000 of that quarantined expenditure. The remaining **$9,000** ~$3,000~ continues to be quarantined and may be allowed as a deduction for a later income year. | Carry-through from correction of section DG 16 example. |
| DG 18 | **Example**  <br>Aircraft Ltd owns an aircraft to which the rules in this subpart apply; the income derived from the asset in the current year is less than 2% of the cost of the aircraft. The company has calculated an outstanding profit balance of $12,000 after the application of section DG 16. Aircraft is 100% owned by Parent Ltd, which has apportioned interest expenditure of $5,000 calculated under section DG 12. Parent has 2 equal shareholders, Alisa who has apportioned interest expenditure of $8,000, and Hamish who has apportioned interest expenditure of $1,000, both calculated under section DG 14. Parent must apply section DG 18 first, and is not required to quarantine any of its interest expenditure; the outstanding profit balance is reduced to $7,000 ($12,000 – $5,000). Alisa's and Hamish's share of the outstanding profit balance is $3,500 each (**$7,000** ~$7,500~ x 50%). Alisa must quarantine $4,500 of interest expenditure ($8,000 – $3,500); Hamish is not required to quarantine any interest expenditure. | Correction of numeric error. |
| DG 19 | **Example, continued from section DG 18**  <br>In the following income year, Aircraft **Ltd** has calculated an outstanding profit balance of $16,000 ~after the application of section DG 18~. Section DG 19 does not apply to Parent Ltd or **Hamish** ~Alisa~ because they have no previously quarantined interest expenditure. However, the section does apply to **Alisa** ~Hamish~ because **she** ~he~ has $4,500 of quarantined interest expenditure from the previous year. **Because Parent Ltd does not have any current year expenditure, Alisa's** ~Hamish's current year apportioned interest expenditure is $7,000, calculated under section DG 14, and his~ share of the outstanding profit balance **of Parent Ltd** is $8,000 ($16,000 x 50%). **Alisa's current year apportioned interest expenditure is $7,000, calculated under section DG 14. Alisa** ~Hamish~ is allowed a deduction for **all her current year expenditure and also a deduction for** $1,000 of previously quarantined expenditure ($8,000 – $7,000). ~His~ **Her** remaining quarantined expenditure is $3,500 ($4,500 – $1,000). | Correction of names and additional clarification. |
| DZ 21 | **Example**  <br>**On 31 March 2013,** Boat Co **has a boat with an acquisition** **cost of $85,000**. ~on 31 March 2013 which~ **The boat** meets the various requirements set out in subpart DG. All the shares in Boat Co are owned by Michelle. The boat has a market value of $75,000, and an adjusted tax value of $55,000. Boat Co transfers the boat to Michelle without payment (which is treated as a dividend of $75,000). For depreciation purposes, Boat Co is treated as disposing of the boat for $55,000, and Michelle is treated as acquiring it for ~$55,000~ **$85,000, and having been allowed a deduction of $30,000 for depreciation loss in past income years**. | Amendments to ensure the example is consistent with the change to section DZ 21. |

#### _Depreciation recovery income for assets transferred in the 2013-14 income year under section DZ 21_

There is a one year transitional period (2013-14 income year) in which companies that own mixed-use assets can transfer those assets to their shareholders without triggering depreciation recovery income (this is referred to as "rollover relief"). The rollover relief provision is contained in section DZ 21.

Section DZ 21(2) previously treated the transfer as if it were a disposal and acquisition for an amount equal to the adjusted tax value of the asset on the date of the transfer. This meant that there was no deprecation recovery income to the company when it transferred the asset to its shareholder(s) because the consideration deemed to have been received was the same as the asset's adjusted tax value.

If the shareholder later sells the asset for more than its adjusted tax value, the policy intention is that depreciation recovery income will be crystallised at this point. To ensure this policy objective is achieved, amendments to section DZ 21 treat the shareholder as stepping into the shoes of the company for depreciation purposes - that is, by having:

*   acquired the asset on the date on which the company acquired it for an amount equal to the amount the company paid to acquire it;
*   used the asset for the purposes for which the company used it;
*   used the depreciation method used by the company in relation to the asset; and
*   been allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss that the company has been allowed since the company's acquisition of the asset.

As well as including all depreciation deductions the company has previously been allowed in the depreciation recovery calculation, this amendment also ensures that any change in use or depreciation method by the shareholder is captured and the shareholder has the correct depreciation cost base.

#### _Value for land and improvements_

The value of land and improvements is relevant to the close company interest deduction quantification provision (section DG 11) and the expenditure quarantining provision (section DG 16).

As originally introduced, these provisions treated the value of land and improvements as the later of:

*   the most recent capital value or annual value (as set by the relevant local authority); or
*   its cost on acquisition (or market value, if the transaction involves an associated person).

In the case of leased land and multiple activities carried out on a single land title, using the capital value or annual value (as set by the relevant local authority) could overstate the asset's value for the purposes of subpart DG.

If, for example, a bach is on leased land, the capital value of the land is likely to overstate the value to the lessee as the lessee does not own the land. Therefore, a greater proportion of the interest deductions of a close company may be subject to apportionment under subpart DG than was intended and more apportioned expenditure will be quarantined under section DG 16 than was intended.

A similar valuation issue arises if, for example, two different taxpayers own separate baches situated on a single legal title. The capital value on the legal title will give the value for both buildings and the whole of the land area. Where the mixed-use activity is being carried on by only one of the owners, it would be very difficult for that owner to reach the quarantining threshold because of the presence of the two houses.

Another example is if a farmer sets up a house on a farm as a farmstay. The house is on the farm land, and is used to derive rental income, but is also used by the farmer's children and their friends when they come home. If the land value cannot be apportioned, the farmer will almost certainly have his farmstay expenditure quarantined under section DG 16 because it would be highly unlikely for the annual income from the farmstay to exceed 2 percent of the value of the total farm.

It is arguable that a leasehold estate is an asset separate from the freehold estate and therefore does not have a capital/annual value itself, which means that the relevant "asset value" is the price paid for the leasehold estate or the market value (if acquired from an associate).

Nevertheless, sections DG 11 and DG 16 have been clarified to ensure the "asset value" used for land and improvements is accurate for both leased land and land where two activities are carried out on a single title. This is achieved by defining the value of land and improvements for the purposes of sections DG 11 and DG 16 as:

1.  the later of either the land's most recent capital value or annual value as set by the relevant local authority, or its cost on acquisition or, if the transaction involves an associated person, its market value; or
2.  if the land or improvement to land is a leasehold estate in land, the market value of the leasehold estate which the person may establish by a valuation that is or has been made by a registered valuer no more than 3 years before the end of the income year; and
3.  if different activities are carried out on the land on a single certificate of title within the meaning of the Land Transfer Act 1952, the value applying under paragraph (a) or (b), as applicable, adjusted as follows:
    1.  by multiplying the value by the percentage that the area of land that is the portion of the land used in relation to the asset to which this subpart applies bears to the total land area described in the certificate of title:
    2.  by a valuation that is or has been made by a registered valuer no more than 3 years before the end of the income year, of the portion of land used in relation to the asset to which this subpart applies.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| Bach Co Ltd owns a bach on leasehold land. The bach is subject to the mixed-use asset rules. The capital value of the land is $400,000, but a registered valuer has provided Bach Co Ltd with a valuation of the leasehold interest in the land of $300,000. The "debt value" for the purposes of section DG 11 is $400,000. Bach Co Ltd has annual interest expense of $20,000 and derives $7,500 of assessable income from the bach annually.<br><br>Under the mixed-use asset rules as introduced (and before the recent amendment), all of Bach Co Ltd's interest expenditure would be subject to apportionment under section DG 9. This is because the debt value is less than or equal to the asset value (section DG 11(3)).<br><br>In addition, Bach Co Ltd would be subject to the expenditure quarantining provision because the income derived ($7,500) is less than 2 percent of the value of the land.<br><br>Both outcomes are unintended, as the true economic value of the asset to Bach Co Ltd is $300,000, not $400,000.<br><br>Under the amended valuation rule, Bach Co Ltd can use $300,000 as the asset value. This means that only $15,000 of interest expenditure ($20,000 x $300,000/$400,000) is subject to apportionment under subpart DG  and the expenditure quarantining provision does not apply (because the income derived is more than 2 percent of the asset value). |     |

#### _Capital use of an asset_

The apportionment formula in section DG 9 has been amended to deal with the situation when there is capital use of an asset, as well as income-earning use and private use.

The issue is explained by the following example.

A privately owned corporate group owns a plane that has the following use (per year):

*   private use (for example, the principal individual shareholder of the group flying overseas on holiday) - 20 days;
*   income-earning use (for example, the shareholder/manager flying overseas for business purposes where there is a direct nexus with income) - 20 days; and
*   capital use (for example, the shareholder/manager flying overseas to analyse potential capital acquisitions) - 20 days.

The plane is therefore used 1/3rd for private use, 1/3rd for income-earning use and 1/3rd for capital use. The plane is unused for the remainder of the year.

The following expenditure is incurred in relation to the plane:

*   $100,000 solely relating to private use (for example, fuel and pilot costs directly attributable to private use);
*   $100,000 solely relating to income-earning use (for example, fuel and pilot costs directly attributable to income-earning use);
*   $100,000 solely relating to capital use (for example, fuel and pilot costs directly attributable to capital use); and
*   $100,000 "mixed-use" expenditure that does not solely relate to any specific use (for example, the annual insurance premium for the plane).

In relation to the non-mixed-use expenditure, the $100,000 solely relating to the income-earning use should be fully deductible (as per section DG 7(1)) and the $200,000 that solely relates to private and capital use should be non-deductible (as per the private and capital limitations in section DA 2).

Mixed-use expenditure of $33,000 that is considered to relate to income-earning use should be deductible under subpart DG. To ensure that this is the result under the mixed-use asset rules, the definition of the "expenditure" item in section DG 9(3)(a) has been amended to ensure the full $100,000 of mixed-use expenditure is included in this item. This requires there to be no apportionment under the capital limitation and the private limitation before the application of the apportionment formula in section DG 9(2):

_Expenditure (that is, all mixed-use expenditure) x (Income-earning days ÷ (Income-earning days + counted days)_)

$100,000 x (20÷60)  =  $33,000

#### _Definitions of "asset income"_

If a taxpayer generates assessable income from a mixed-use asset in an income year of less than 2 percent of the asset's value, some of the deductions generated by the asset are quarantined until a future income year. The low relative level of income generated by the use of the asset suggests that the asset is likely to be a predominantly private asset and therefore it is appropriate to suspend tax deductions that could otherwise be used to offset the taxpayer's income from other sources.

If the income does not reach the 2 percent threshold, any deductions above the assessable income from the asset (the "asset income") derived in that income year are quarantined, to be accessed in future income years. The effect is that, in a year when a taxpayer derives a relatively low level of assessable income from the asset, the taxpayer is allowed deductions sufficient to offset that assessable income (so no tax is payable in respect of the income from the asset), but is not able to access other deductions for that asset.

In a future income year, the taxpayer is able to access quarantined deductions if they have income from the use of the asset that exceeds their current year deductions. The amount of quarantined expenditure that can be accessed by the taxpayer is the lesser of the quarantined expenditure and the excess of current year income from the asset (the "asset income") above current year allowable deductions.

An amendment to the definition of "asset income" in the provision that allows taxpayers to access quarantined expenditure (section DG 17) has aligned this definition with the definition of the same term in section DG 16.

In the primary quarantining provision (section DG 16), the "asset income" is the total amount of income, other than an amount of exempt income, derived for the income year from the use of the asset. This is the correct approach as taxpayers should not be able to access excess deductions because they have earned exempt income, as they do not need the deductions to offset against the exempt income.

In contrast, before the amendment to section DG 17, "asset income" was the total amount of income derived for the current year from the use of the asset. There was no exclusion for exempt income. This means that taxpayers could have accessed excess quarantined deductions on the basis of exempt income they derive in relation to the asset (for example, income from associates, which can be easily manipulated). Given the income is exempt, accessing quarantined deductions in this way would also have given rise to a net loss on the asset for that income year which is contrary to the policy intention of the provision.

Accordingly, the definition of "asset income" in section DG 17 has been aligned with the definition of the same term in section DG 16, that is, for both sections "asset income" is the total amount of income, other than an amount of exempt income, derived for the income year from the use of the asset.

### Application dates

The amendments to the mixed-use asset associated persons rule and the legislative examples apply for the 2013-14 and later income years (the beginning of the mixed-use asset regime).

The amendment to the depreciation rollover relief provision applies generally for the 2013-14 and later income years. However, the amendment does not apply in relation to an asset when a shareholder who acquires the asset disposes of it before 22 November 2013 (the date of the introduction of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Bill).

The amendment to address the potential overvaluation of land and improvements for the purposes of the mixed-use asset rules applies for the 2013-14 and later income years.

The amendment to address capital use of an asset applies for the 2013-14 and later income years for land and improvements, and for the 2014-15 and later income years for aircraft and boats.

The amendment to align the "asset income" definition in section DG 17 with that in section DG 16 applies for the 2013-14 and later income years for land and improvements, and for the 2014-15 and later income years for aircraft and boats.

Loss grouping contingent on group loss company satisfying its liabilities for deductible expenditure
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### _Sections CG 2, CG 2C, CG 2D, CG 2E and FM 5(3), (4) of the Income Tax Act 2007_

The loss grouping rules have been amended to correct an unintended consequence arising during the rewrite of the Income Tax Acts. The amendments confirm the benefit of past loss grouping is contingent on the group loss company satisfying its liabilities relating to past deductible expenditure (other than under the financial arrangement rules).

Consequential amendments have also been made to clarify the relationship of new sections CG 2C to CG 2E with the consolidated group rules in subpart FM, the amalgamation rules in subpart FO, and the loss grouping rules in sections IC 11 and IC 12.

### Background

Since enactment of section 191(7B) of the Income Tax Act 1976, the grouping of tax losses has been contingent on the group loss company fully satisfying its liabilities for deductible expenditure included in its tax losses made available to another company under the loss grouping rules. Section 191(7B) was re-enacted into the Income Tax Act 1994 as sections CE 4, IE 1(4) and IG 2(9).

These provisions permitted the Commissioner to amend an assessment of a group profit company to reduce the amount of grouped tax losses to the extent the group loss company had not satisfied all liabilities giving rise to deductions included in the grouped tax losses. This amendment could be made for any income year as the time bar did not apply.

The rewrite of these provisions included a policy change (in section CG 2 of the 2004 Act), that changed the timing of the adjustment for remitted or cancelled debts for past deductible expenditure. This policy change was to better align the adjustment (for remitted or cancelled liabilities relating to past deductible expenditure) with self-assessment by eliminating the need to amend past assessments.

Under current section CG 2, a remitted or cancelled debt for past deductible expenditure is treated as income derived in the year the debt is remitted (for example, on the company being struck off or liquidated). However, section CG 2 does not provide that the benefit of loss grouping is contingent upon the group loss company fully satisfying its liabilities for past deductible expenditure incurred in years in which tax losses were grouped. The amendments correct this anomaly in the law.

### Key features

Section CG 2 no longer applies to a group loss company if:

*   the group loss company has previously made a tax loss available to another company in the same group of companies under the loss grouping rules; and
*   the group loss company in the same group of companies as the group profit company has unsatisfied liabilities for deductible expenditure included in those past tax losses made available under the loss grouping rules; and
*   the group loss company in the same group of companies is removed from the register of companies; or
*   either the group profit company or the group loss company has left the group and for both cases, the group loss company is insolvent, in receivership or in liquidation at that time.

Instead, new sections CG 2C and CG 2D apply, as appropriate, to these circumstances. These amendments restore to the law, the long-standing policy that the benefit of grouped tax losses is contingent on the group loss company fully satisfying its liabilities relating to past deductible expenditure incurred in the year the losses are grouped.

Under sections CG 2C or CG 2D, the group profit company derives income equal to the amount of certain unsatisfied liabilities of the group loss company.

New section CG 2C will apply if the group loss company has been removed from the register of companies.

New section CG 2D will apply if the profit company and the group loss company break their grouping status.

New section CG 2E permits the company deriving income under either section CG 2C or CG 2D to apportion the income appropriately among certain group companies.

Amendments to section FM 5 clarify how sections CG 2C and CG 2D are to apply to a consolidated group of companies.

An amendment to section FO 5 ensures that neither of sections CG 2C or section CG 2D apply on an amalgamation. However, to ensure an amalgamation cannot be used to avoid the effect of section CG 2C or CG 2D, the amalgamated company is treated as if it were the group loss company after amalgamation in relation to relevant unpaid liabilities of the group loss company.

Sections IC 11 and IC 12 (relating to loss grouping) apply before section CG 2C or section CG 2D apply.

### Application date

New sections CG 2C, CG 2D, and CG 2E, and consequential amendments to sections FM 5 and FO 5 apply from 22 November 2013, the date the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Bill was introduced.

### Detailed analysis

#### _Reduction in benefit of group tax losses under the Income Tax Act 1994_

The interaction of sections IG 2(9), IE 1(4) and CE 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 permitted the Commissioner to amend an assessment of a group profit company to reduce the amount of losses made available under the loss grouping rules. This amended assessment of a group profit company could be made for any income year - it was not limited by the four-year time bar that normally applies to income tax assessments. However, the reduction in the benefit of grouped tax losses was limited to the amount of remitted or cancelled debts of the group loss company.

In the decision of _Hotdip Galvanisers (Christchurch) Ltd v CIR_ (1999) 19 NZTC 15,337, the Court of Appeal confirmed that, under the 1976 Act's corresponding provision to section IG 2(9) of the 1994 Act:

*   the Commissioner was entitled to amend an assessment of a group profit company in a group that received the benefit of tax losses from a group loss company, if the group loss company's deductible expenditure forming part of the loss offsets was remitted or cancelled;
*   the provision did not require the Commissioner to first re-assess the group loss company for the remission adjustment; and
*   the Commissioner was not limited by the four-year time bar that normally applies to income tax assessments.

#### _Policy change in Income Tax Act 2004_

In rewriting sections CE 4 and IE 1(4)(d) of the Income Tax Act 1994 into section CG 2 of the Income Tax 2004, it was considered desirable to place the timing of the effect of the remission on a basis consistent with self-assessment. This policy change resulted in timing the effect of the adjustment for the remitted or cancelled debts to the year of remission or cancellation in contrast to the amendment of previous years' assessments under the former law.

#### _Unintended consequence_

Section CG 2 applies only to the taxpayer that had incurred the debt, and does not apply to a group profit company if a group loss company cannot be assessed for section CG 2 income (a company that is removed from the register of companies cannot be assessed for remission income). Consequently, no legislative provision exists to reduce the benefit of past grouped tax losses from group profit companies if debts of the group loss company are remitted or cancelled, in contrast to the situation under the 1994 Act.

New sections CG 2C and CG 2D correct this anomaly in the law and ensure that the benefit of past loss grouping is contingent on the group loss company:

*   fully satisfying its liabilities for deductible expenditure included in a net loss (other than expenditure relating to a financial arrangement rules); and
*   that net loss has been included in a tax loss subsequently made available under the loss grouping rules to another company in the same group of companies.

#### _Group loss company removed from the register of companies_

Section CG 2C applies to a group profit company in a group of companies if:

*   the group profit company has received the benefit of tax losses under the loss grouping rules from a group loss company in the same group of companies;
*   the group loss company is removed from the register of companies (and not subsequently restored to the register);
*   the group profit company and the group loss company are in the same group of companies immediately prior to the removal of the group loss company from the register of companies;
*   at the time the company is removed from the register of companies, the group loss company has unsatisfied liabilities for past deductible expenditure relating to tax losses made available to the group profit company under the loss grouping rules; and
*   the removal of the group loss company from the register of companies occurs after the tax loss has been made available to another company under the loss grouping rules.

On removal from the register of companies, there is no longer a company in existence to meet those unpaid unsatisfied debts or be assessed for income under section CG 2. New section CG 2C section treats the group profit company as deriving income equal to the remitted or cancelled liability for deductible expenditure incurred by the group loss company.

New section CG 2C applies if the group loss company and the group profit company are in the same group of companies immediately before the group loss company is removed from the register of companies. If grouping status is broken, section CG 2D applies.

The income is treated as derived on the day the group loss company is removed from the register of companies.

New section CG 2C will not apply to an expenditure relating to the financial arrangement rules.

#### _Group loss company or group profit company leaving the group_

A number of commercial considerations mitigate against section CG 2C applying to a group profit company when grouping status is broken with a group loss company.

These considerations include the following:

*   At the time the group loss company is removed from the register of companies, the management decisions relating to the group loss company would made by a different management team from that managing the affairs of the group profit company. A decision to remove the group loss company from the register of companies by the new owners need not consider the implications for that group profit company given they are no longer part of the same group of companies.
*   A tax obligation for a company arising from the liquidation of a group loss company that is no longer part of the same group as the group profit company (and beyond the management of the group's affairs) can impact adversely on the group profit company's balance sheet.
*   The tax obligation can potentially affect existing financing arrangements.

When a company exits the group, it can be assumed that management would be aware of the following facts at that time:

*   if an insolvent group loss company has not satisfied its debts giving rise to tax losses transferred under the loss grouping rules;
*   if the exiting company has received the benefit of tax losses from that insolvent group loss company;
*   if the exiting company is the insolvent group loss company; and
*   there is a risk that the insolvent loss group company might not subsequently satisfy its debt obligations for past deductible expenditure incurred in years in which past tax losses were made available under the loss grouping rules.

Under new section CG 2D, the benefit of past grouped tax losses is adjusted to the profit company, to the extent the insolvent loss group company has unsatisfied liabilities for past deductible expenditure in years in which losses were grouped. However, if the group loss company satisfies its unpaid debts for past deductible expenditure before the exit time, without giving a preference to one creditor over another, section CG 2D would not apply.

New section CG 2D will not apply to an expenditure relating to a financial arrangement.

#### _Voidable transaction_

Because solvency is measured at a point in time, an issue arises under the voidable transaction rule in the Companies Act 1993.

It is possible for a payment by the group loss company to satisfy an unpaid liability for past deductible expenditure to be a voidable transaction under the Companies Act 1993. If the payment is a voidable transaction (a creditor is repaid in preference to other creditors), a liquidator could subsequently recover the payment from the creditor, resulting in the relevant liability being reinstated.

The Commissioner has discretion, at the time grouping is broken, to determine whether a transaction to satisfy relevant unpaid liabilities could be a voidable transaction under the Companies Act 1993. If the Commissioner exercises this discretion, for the purpose of section CG 2D only, transactions relating to the funding and payment of such a transaction can be ignored in determining whether the group loss company is solvent.

#### _Section IC 11 and IC 12_

Section IC 11 permits the Commissioner to amend an assessment of a group profit company to reduce the tax loss of a group loss company made available to it for a tax year if the Commissioner has reduced the available tax loss of the group loss company for that year. This section applies, for example, when the group loss company has taken a tax position on the deductibility of an expenditure that has not been accepted by the Commissioner.

Section IC 12 ensures that deductions of a group loss company relating to inter-company bad debts or decline in the value of shares in a group company are not available for grouping.

Sections IC 11 and IC 12 are applied before sections CG 2C or CG 2D are applied.

Remitted amounts on discharge from bankruptcy
---------------------------------------------

#### _Sections CG 2 and CG 2B of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Section CG will no longer apply to a bankrupt on discharge from bankruptcy, as it conflicts with the "fresh start" principles of insolvency law on discharge from bankruptcy. Section CG 2 applies to treat an amount of income equal to the amount of remitted or cancelled debts that were incurred for past deductible expenditure.

Instead, section CG 2B now applies to a person discharged from bankruptcy. This new section provides that a discharged bankrupt will derive remission income to offset against any tax losses the person has. However the amount of the income is limited to the lesser of the following:

*   the total amount of debt remitted on discharge from bankruptcy that relates to past deductible expenditure; and
*   the bankrupt's loss balance at the end of the tax year preceding the discharge from bankruptcy after taking into account any reduction in the loss balance made by the Commissioner under section 177C of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Background

On 3 October 2011, the Minister of Revenue issued a press release calling for submissions on remedial items, including one relating to the Commissioner's powers, under section 177C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Under section 177C, the Commissioner may:

*   write off uncollectible amounts of tax owing by the bankrupt; and
*   make consequential adjustments to the taxpayer's tax losses carried forward (the loss balance).

Submissions raised two issues relating to the remission of most debts when a bankrupt is discharged from bankruptcy:

*   Insolvency law remits most debts of a bankrupt at the time of discharge. One issue was whether it was appropriate for section CG 2 to recover all of the past deductions (as remission income of the taxpayer) if debts incurred for those past deductions:
    *   remained unpaid on the taxpayer being adjudged bankrupt; and
    *   were subsequently remitted on discharge from bankruptcy.
*   It was unclear whether remission income under section CG 2 was taken into account in the calculation of the bankrupt's taxable income before or after being discharged from bankruptcy. This uncertainty potentially impacted on the Commissioner's powers to write off tax and adjust a loss balance of the bankrupt.

### Application date

The amendment applies to a discharge from bankruptcy that occurs on or after 1 April 2014.

### Detailed analysis

Section CG 2 applies to a person:

*   who has been allowed a deduction for an amount the person is liable to pay;
*   that liability is later remitted or cancelled (but not if the remission or cancellation is a dividend); and
*   the financial arrangement rules do not require a base price adjustment to be made for that remission or cancellation.

#### _Effect of law under the Income Tax Act 1994_

Before enactment of the Income Tax Act 2004, a debt remission in the course of bankruptcy would have resulted in the Commissioner amending the income tax assessment for the tax year if the debt was incurred for a deductible expenditure (section CE 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994).

This amended assessment was not limited by the four-year time-bar that normally applies to the amendment of income tax assessments. However, the amount of the amended assessment to reduce past tax losses was limited to the amount of remitted or cancelled debts of the bankrupt. This amended assessment would have resulted in either:

*   a reduction in the person's loss balance at the end of that earlier tax year; or
*   an increased income tax liability being assessed for that earlier tax year.

#### _Policy change in Income Tax Act 2004_

In rewriting section CE 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 as section CG 2 of the Income Tax 2004, it was considered desirable to place the timing of the effect of the remission on a basis consistent with self-assessment. This change was to the timing of the adjustment for the debt remission, that is, the adjustment would be made in the year of remission rather than amending prior years' assessments to make that adjustment.

However, this change in the timing has left it unclear whether the bankrupt would have income under section CG 2 on discharge from bankruptcy.

#### _Amendment to section CG 2, new section CG 2B_

The potential application of section CG 2 to a bankrupt on discharge from bankruptcy conflicts with the "fresh start" policy of insolvency law for a discharged bankrupt. The amendments ensure that section CG 2 does not apply on discharge from bankruptcy. Instead, the new section CG 2B applies to a person discharged from bankruptcy.

If a person discharged from bankruptcy has a loss balance at the end of the tax year preceding the year in which the discharge occurs, the person has income equal to the lesser of:

*   the total amount of debts remitted which relate to past deductions; and
*   the person's loss balance at the end of the tax year preceding the year of discharge (after taking into account any reduction in that loss balance by the Commissioner under section 177C of the Tax Administration Act 1994).

Income derived under section CG 2B is treated as derived on the first day of the income year in which the person is discharged from bankruptcy. This income is included in the calculation of the person's taxable income for the year of discharge and:

*   effectively reduces the benefit of the loss balance of the taxpayer brought forward from the previous year; and
*   ensures that a discharged bankrupt does not have an income tax liability for debts discharged in bankruptcy.

If a person discharged from bankruptcy does not have a loss balance at the end of the tax year preceding the year in which the discharge occurs, that person will not have remission income under either of sections CG 2 or CG 2B.

Serious hardship
----------------

#### _Sections 176 to 177C of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

Amendments have been made to allow the Commissioner, in appropriate circumstances, to bankrupt taxpayers, who are in serious hardship and to ensure the reasons why the debt arose are not a factor in determining whether the taxpayer is in serious hardship. These amendments ensure that the legislation is consistent with Inland Revenue's operational practice.

### Background

In 2003, the debt and hardship rules were introduced. Under the rules the Commissioner must maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from a taxpayer and deal with cases in an efficient manner. However, the Commissioner may not recover to the extent that recovery is an inefficient use of the Commissioner's resources or if it would place a taxpayer, who is a natural person (individual), in serious hardship.

The rules provide incentives for taxpayers who are having problems paying their tax to contact Inland Revenue and discuss the payment options available to them. The best option is always payment of the full amount on or before the due date. If that is not possible, taxpayers can enter an instalment arrangement and pay the debt off over time. If the debt cannot be paid off over time, the Commissioner has a discretion under which she can write off tax. In addition, the Commissioner must write off the tax that is not collected if the taxpayer is bankrupted, liquidated or their estate has been distributed. The Commissioner's practice is to bankrupt taxpayers who cannot pay in appropriate circumstances, for example, when it is considered the write-off would have an adverse effect on taxpayers' perceptions of the integrity of the tax system.

Following a review of the legislation, an alternative view of the rules was raised which had two related implications.

The first implication was that bankruptcy is a recovery action and at the point that any further recovery action would cause serious hardship, bankruptcy, along with any other recovery action, was prohibited. Therefore, the Commissioner could not bankrupt a taxpayer when the taxpayer was facing serious hardship.

Inland Revenue's view is that bankruptcy does not necessarily place or cause a taxpayer to be in serious hardship. This is consistent with the policy intent; the Official Assignee takes over the bankrupt's affairs and ensures they do not suffer serious hardship.

The second implication arose from the alternative view that in determining whether a taxpayer is in serious hardship, Inland Revenue needed first to consider how the debt arose. For example, if the taxpayer's debt arose from the taxpayer enjoying goods of an expensive nature, the taxpayer would not be in serious hardship and Inland Revenue could recover the debt.

This view was at odds with the way Inland Revenue applies the debt and hardship rules and could result in adverse outcomes for taxpayers. The view was also inconsistent with the policy intention of the rules which is to protect taxpayers from being placed in serious hardship as a result of recovery actions taken by Inland Revenue.

Inland Revenue's approach is that when a taxpayer applies for financial relief, Inland Revenue determines whether the taxpayer can pay the debt, or whether paying part or all of the debt would place the taxpayer in serious hardship. The cause of the outstanding tax is not taken into account in determining serious hardship as the alternative view would have required. If paying the debt would place the taxpayer in serious hardship, Inland Revenue then considers how best to deal with the debt, and in some cases writes off the debt. In some cases the taxpayer would be bankrupted and in other cases the debt would remain. In deciding which action to take, Inland Revenue will, at this stage, consider how the debt arose and the need to maintain the integrity of the tax system.

### Key features

The Tax Administration Act 1994 has clarified the meaning of "serious hardship" and it has been made clear that the factors that give rise to the taxpayer not being able to pay the outstanding tax are not taken into account when determining whether or not the taxpayer is in serious hardship.

It has also been clarified that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can, in appropriate circumstances, bankrupt taxpayers, when they are in serious hardship.

### Application date

The amendments apply from 30 June 2014, being the date of enactment.

Unacceptable tax position
-------------------------

#### _Section 141B of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

An amendment to the unacceptable tax position penalty clarifies that the penalty does not apply to shortfalls that arise in respect of GST and withholding-type taxes. That is, the unacceptable tax position penalty only applies to income tax shortfalls. The amendment clarifies an amendment made in 2007.

### Background

A tax shortfall is the difference between a taxpayer's correct tax liability calculated under the legislation and the position a taxpayer took in their tax return. There are five categories of shortfall penalty - ranging from not taking reasonable care (when the penalty is 20 percent of the tax shortfall) to evasion or a similar act (when the penalty is 150 percent of the tax shortfall). The appropriate penalty is assessed when a required standard is breached, for example, if the taxpayer does not take reasonable care, the penalty for not taking reasonable care is assessed.

One of the shortfall penalties is the unacceptable tax position penalty. An "unacceptable tax position" is a tax position that, if viewed objectively, fails to meet the standard of being "about as likely as not to be correct". This does not mean that the taxpayer's tax position must be the better view or be more than likely the correct view, but rather that the position is "about as likely as not to be correct".

The aim of the shortfall penalty is to encourage taxpayers to take tax positions that are correct in terms of the law. A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty of 20 percent if the taxpayer takes an unacceptable tax position in relation to income tax, and the tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer's tax position is more than both:

*   $50,000; and
*   1 percent of the taxpayer's total tax figure for the relevant return period.

A change to the legislation in 2003 meant the unacceptable tax position penalty potentially applied to all tax shortfalls over the thresholds, including cases when the tax shortfall arose from a mistake in the facts or when an unacceptable tax position was taken and immediately corrected. Taxpayers and tax agents noted that the penalty was having an adverse effect on taxpayer behaviour, resulting in taxpayers being less inclined to make voluntary disclosures. In 2006 a short-term solution was put in place which gave Inland Revenue a discretion not to impose the penalty in specific circumstances.

In 2007 the discretion was repealed, the threshold for imposition of the penalty was increased and the scope of the penalty was limited to income tax, that is, the penalty was no longer to be imposed on GST or withholding tax shortfalls. At the same time, the reduction given for voluntary disclosures made before a taxpayer is notified of a pending audit or investigation when the shortfall arose from the taxpayer not taking reasonable care, or from an unacceptable tax position, increased from 75 percent to 100 percent.

Following a review of the legislation, it was determined that the 2007 amendment did not achieve the desired policy outcome. The 2007 amendment inserted the words "in relation to income tax" in section 141B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. However, section RA 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 deems the tax types listed in section RA 1 to be "income tax" and therefore were subject to the unacceptable tax position penalty. These taxes include PAYE, fringe benefit tax and non-resident withholding tax.

The intention of the 2007 amendment was clear and taxpayers expected that following the amendment the unacceptable tax position penalty would only apply to tax shortfalls that arose in annual income tax returns. Inland Revenue's practice was to apply the penalty only to tax shortfalls that arise in annual income tax returns.

### Key features

The amendment clarifies that the tax types listed in section RA 1 of the Income Tax 2007 have been removed from the scope of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty so that the penalty applies only to tax positions relating to income tax.

### Application date

The amendment applies retrospectively to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2008 (the application date of the 2007 amendment).

Clarification of new due date for payment of tax
------------------------------------------------

#### _Section 142A of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

Amendments clarify that a new due date is not set when the Commissioner makes a systems-generated default assessment, and that when a taxpayer files a return following a systems-generated default assessment, a new due date is set for the resulting tax liability.

### Background

If the Commissioner makes an assessment or amends and increases an assessment, a new due date is set for the tax assessed. Before an amendment in 2007, a new due date was only required when the Commissioner increased an assessment. This had the effect of creating an incentive for taxpayers who considered they did not have a tax liability to file a "nil return". This meant that if the Commissioner determined at a later date that the taxpayer did have a tax liability, a new due date would be set for the tax assessed by the Commissioner. In the absence of the "nil return", the taxpayer would be liable for use-of-money interest and late payment penalties from the original due date and, when the taxpayer had breached a required standard of behaviour, shortfall penalties.

There was a concern that the penalty rules were discouraging taxpayers from complying voluntarily with their tax obligations, as the imposition of both use-of-money interest and late payment penalties overly penalised taxpayers. Also, the application of late payment penalties when the taxpayer considered they did not have a tax liability could be seen as inappropriate. In some cases the late payment penalty was effectively being used as a penalty for the taxpayer not filing their return on time.

In 2007 an amendment was made under which Inland Revenue is required to set a new due date when it makes an assessment or increases an assessment. In 2009 the provision was again amended. The aim of this amendment was to remove the requirement to set a new due date when Inland Revenue makes a systems-generated default assessment.

More recently, concerns were raised that the 2009 amendment did not achieve the desired policy outcome. In particular, it was found that when a taxpayer files a return following a default assessment, a new due date would only be set when the tax assessed by the taxpayer is more than the default assessment and the new due date only applied to the difference.

This was contrary to the policy intent which is that the late payment penalty is a penalty imposed when the taxpayer knows they have a tax liability and they do not pay on time. Default assessments are made by the Commissioner under section 106 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. There are a number of different circumstances when the Commissioner can issue a default assessment, for example, when a return has not been made or following an audit or investigation when the Commissioner is not satisfied with the return filed by the taxpayer.

The 2009 amendment which removed the requirement to set a new due date when Inland Revenue makes a default assessment was aimed at systems-generated default assessments, assessments generated by Inland Revenue's FIRST system to encourage the taxpayer to file an outstanding return. It was not aimed at assessments made by the Commissioner following an audit. It was considered appropriate to impose late payment penalties from the original due date because, in the case of systems-generated default assessments, the assessment is issued because there is a concern about the taxpayer's non-compliance.

### Key features

Section 142A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been clarified to ensure that a new due date is not set when the Commissioner makes a systems-generated default assessment. It has also be clarified that when a taxpayer files a return following a systems-generated default assessment, a new due date is set for the resulting tax liability.

### Application date

The amendment will apply retrospectively from 6 October 2009 (which was the application date of the 2009 amendment).

References to loss attributing qualifying companies
---------------------------------------------------

#### _Sections 141EB and 141FD of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

In 2010 the loss attributing qualifying company rules were repealed and the look-through company rules introduced. The promoter penalty legislation still referred to "loss attributing qualifying companies" when it should have referred to "look-through companies".

The amendment updates references in the promoter (section 141EB) penalty legislation that referred to loss attributing qualifying companies so they now refer to look-through companies. The penalty relief provision for loss attributing qualifying companies has also been repealed.

### Application date

The amendments apply from 1 April 2011 (the date from which the look-through company rules apply).

Working for Families Tax Credits
--------------------------------

#### _Sections MB 1(5C), 7B(2) and 13(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Amendments have been made to clarify that various payments that are of a capital nature, or are windfall gains, are excluded from the definition of "family scheme income" in section MB 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007. These include repayments of mistaken or misdirected payments, refunds, a capital payment from a person's ownership in a business, inheritances and lottery winnings.

### Background

Working for Families tax credits are provided to the principal caregiver of dependent children based, among other things, on their level of family scheme income for a tax year. The tax credits are abated when family scheme income exceeds $36,350 at a rate of 21.25 cents per dollar. Families that choose instalment payments of tax credits throughout the year are required to estimate their family scheme income and are subject to an end-of-year reconciliation. Alternatively, families can apply for an end-of-year lump sum payment.

The family scheme income provisions have been amended several times over the last decade, including as part of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. The definition of "family scheme income" was broadened as part of Budget 2010, with effect from 1 April 2011. This included a new provision for other payments a family may receive to replace lost income or to meet their usual living expenses. The broader definition is intended to improve the fairness and integrity of Working for Families tax credits by, for example, countering arrangements that have the effect of inflating entitlements beyond what people's true economic circumstances justify.

In 2012 the Government agreed that employer-provided vouchers and other short-term charge facilities should also be included in family scheme income. This change came into effect from 1 April 2014.

The definition of "family scheme income" is also used, with some adjustments, for determining eligibility for some people applying for student allowances and the community services card. A similar definition is used for student loan repayments.

### Key features

Changes to the rules in subpart MB of the Income Tax Act 2007 describing the definition of "family scheme income" have been made. The main change adds the following items to the list of payments that are excluded from the "other payments" rule in section MB 13:

*   repayment of a loan;
*   repayment of a mistaken or misdirected payment;
*   refund of a payment (including tax, student loan and child support refunds resulting from an overpayment);
*   payment from the person's ownership of an investment activity or business, where it is received on capital account, and the payment is not a loan and is not a payment by a trustee;
*   payment of an inheritance from a deceased person's estate;
*   money won from gambling or a New Zealand lottery.

The other changes in subpart MB:

*   correct a cross-reference error in section MB 1(5C);
*   amend section MB 1(5C) to cover depreciation loss for a building in an investment activity, to mirror earlier changes made to section MB 3 to ignore net losses from investment activities; and
*   correct a drafting error in section MB 7B(2)(b) to refer to a "benefit" instead of a "fringe benefit".

### Application dates

The amendments to section MB 13(2) apply for the 2015-16 and later income years.

The amendments to section MB 1(5C) apply from 1 April 2011.

The amendments to section MB 7B(2) apply from 1 April 2014.

### Detailed analysis

Current sections MB 1 to MB 12 list specific amounts that are included in family scheme income. Section MB 13(1) includes other payments in the definition of family scheme income when the payment is paid or provided to the person from any source and used by the person to:

*   replace lost or diminished income of the person or the person's family; or
*   meet usual living expenses of the person or the person's family.

Section MB 13(2) excludes payments from section MB 13(1) when the payment is not intended to form part of family scheme income. An example is when a payment is already included in family scheme income under sections MB 1 to MB 12, or when it is paid or provided by the government and treated as exempt income for tax and welfare purposes.

The Working for Families tax credits are income-tested on family income. While it has a broad definition of income, it is not the policy intent for the tax credits to be asset-tested. For example, using money or cash assets from a person's bank account for usual living expenses is not intended to be included in family scheme income, whereas interest earned on savings is included. Similarly, the family scheme income definition is not intended to capture the realisation of assets into cash, other than the extent to which it is assessable income under the Income Tax Act 2007.

Section MB 13(2)(b) excludes a payment if it is the proceeds of the disposal of property and not assessable income of the person disposing of the property. This is intended to prevent, for example, the proceeds from the sale of a family car, when the proceeds are used to meet usual living expenses, from being included in family scheme income. The exception is when sales proceeds are assessable income for that person.

There are payments not covered by section MB 13(2)(b) but which are similar, or they relate to a change in how assets are held or realised, which should be excluded. It is also not the policy intention to include windfall gains in family scheme income, to the extent that they are not assessable income. For families who estimate their family scheme income upfront, it would not be possible to accurately estimate windfall gains, and could lead to end-of-year debts. It is also unlikely that the family would rely on windfall gains to meet the family's usual living expenses.

Section MB 13(2) has been amended to exclude items that can be technically caught by the wording of section MB 13(1) but do not come within the policy intent of that provision. They are:

*   repayment of a loan - this covers the repayment of the principal of the loan. Interest payable on the loan is assessable income and is already included in family scheme income under another provision;
*   repayment of a mistaken or misdirected payment - this is not additional money for the person or their family;
*   refund of a payment (including tax, student loan and child support refunds resulting from an overpayment);
*   payment of an inheritance from a deceased person's estate; and
*   money won from gambling or a New Zealand lottery - these windfall gains are not intended to be caught by the "other payments" rule.

The amendments also include in the list of excluded items:

*   a payment from the person's ownership of an investment activity or business, when it is received on capital account, and the payment is not a loan and is not a payment by a trustee.

Dividends, shareholder salary, interest, or rent from a business or investment activity are not received on capital account and are already included under other provisions in subpart MB. A payment from a person's investment or business received on capital account is equivalent to the withdrawal of funds from a savings account and should likewise not be included in family scheme income. The person and their family are not "better off" from receiving the payment; rather they are converting their assets into cash. Often the payment on capital account will be referred to as "drawings", although some drawings may be a loan or income that has been incorrectly labelled.

A loan from a business or investment to the person will be excluded under section MB 13(2)(a) if it is on the basis of ordinary commercial terms and conditions.

The following examples illustrate situations when drawings are not included in the definition of family scheme income under section MB 13(2).

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 1 |     |
| In 2012 John invests $20,000 into his partnership to boost working capital. The partnership grows. In 2016, John withdraws $20,000 from the partnership into his family's joint bank account. He and the family use the money for normal day-to-day items. The $20,000 would not be included as family scheme income under section MB 13 as, while it was paid to John and used to meet the family's usual living expenses, it falls under the exemption for withdrawal of capital funds invested in a business - section MB 13(2)(bd). |     |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 2 |     |
| Hayley owns a company and draws out an amount of money on capital account for living costs. The company derives a profit and income tax is paid. An imputed dividend is declared, from which Hayley repays/offsets the drawings. The taxable dividend is treated as family scheme income so the drawings are not included in the family scheme income because section MB 13(2)(p) would apply. (Note also that under section MB 4 any company income that would be attributed as family scheme income is reduced by the dividend.) |     |

Child support
-------------

#### _Sections 2, 9, 40, 44, 65, 81, 92, 98, 142, 179A of the Child Support Act 1991_

Various remedial changes are made to the Child Support Act 1991 to clarify wording, correct errors, make further consequential changes and make small changes to simplify the child support scheme.

### Background

Under the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 a number of changes were made concerning child support terms, for example, the "custodial parent" of the qualifying child is now referred to as the "receiving carer". The Child Support Amendment Act 2013 will also amend, from 1 April 2015, the way a formula assessment of child support is determined and make improvements to the operation of the child support scheme.

### Key features

The Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 makes the following remedial changes to the Child Support Act 1991 (as amended by the Child Support Amendment Act 2013):

*   the definition of "election period" in the interpretation section has been repealed as there is a new definition of "election period" in new section 40AA;
*   new section 9(1)(c) clarifies that a beneficiary is not required to apply for child support if they are _already_ a receiving carer;
*   it is clarified that notices of election in new section 40(1) cannot be given after the end of the child support year to which the election relates;
*   the ordering of provisions in new section 44 relating to the end-of-year reconciliation of an estimate of income have been corrected to ensure the intended policy outcome is achieved;
*   consequential changes to section 65 have been made in light of the new rules for determining liable parents and receiving carers, and to prevent a voluntary agreement and a formula assessment for a child being in force simultaneously;
*   new section 92(3A) has been repealed as the provision is no longer required;
*   section 98 has been amended to align with new section 32 on the method for distributing the minimum annual amount of child support when there is more than one receiving carer;
*   a change ensures that a non-parent receiving carer who has been granted a social security benefit under the Social Security Act 1964 cannot waiver the right to collect child support from a liable parent; and
*   further consequential amendments have been made to reflect the changes in child support terminology.

### Application date

The amendments will apply from 1 April 2015.

Associated persons and person with a power of appointment or removal
--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### _Section YB 11(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007_

An amendment to the associated persons rules ensures that a person with a power of appointment or removal of a trustee will not be associated with the trustee under section YB 11 (Trustee and person with power of appointment or removal) if they are subject to the professional code of conduct and disciplinary processes of an approved organisation. This is a remedial amendment to ensure the provision operates as intended. Before the amendment, members of approved organisations could avail themselves of the exclusion, but non-members, who were still subject to the approved organisation's professional code of conduct and disciplinary processes, could not.

### Background

Section YB 11(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 prescribes that a trustee of a trust and a person with the power of appointment or removal of trustees in relation to the same trust are associated for tax purposes.

An exclusion to this associated persons test was enacted by the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013. This exclusion was intended to ensure that those who receive a power of appointment or removal of a trustee in their professional capacity are not associated with the trustee of the trust.

Among other requirements, the exemption applies to a person who is a "member of an approved organisation". To be an approved organisation, the organisation's natural person members must be subject to a professional code of conduct and to disciplinary processes in accordance with that code (among other requirements).

There were circumstances in which this exemption did not operate as intended.

Using New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA) as an example of an approved organisation, chartered accountancy (CA) practices can have partners who are members of NZICA and partners who are not members. A partner in a CA practice who is not a member of NZICA is still subject to NZICA's code of ethics and disciplinary process because they are part of a member firm. However, because they are not a member of NZICA themselves, they were previously not covered by the exclusion in section YB 11(2).

This was contrary to the policy of the exclusion - to exclude from the association test those trustees acting in a professional capacity. The membership of a professional body is generally an appropriate test to achieve this policy intention as it ensures that the class of persons able to avail themselves of the exclusion is limited and a high standard has to be met before the exclusion is available. The members of professional bodies (such as the New Zealand Law Society and NZICA) are also the most likely trustees to be acting in a professional capacity. However, a non-member of NZICA working in a CA firm is just as likely as an NZICA member to be a trustee in their professional capacity and should not be treated any differently for the purpose of the associated persons test.

### Key features

The exclusion in section YB 11(2) has been extended to include not only members of an approved organisation, but also persons who are subject to the approved organisation's code of ethics and disciplinary process (provided the other requirements of the exclusion in section YB 11(2) are also met).

### Application dates

The remedial amendment has the same application date as the original exclusion in section YB 11(2), that is, it applies for the purposes of:

1.  provisions other than the land provisions, for the 2010-11 and later income years;
2.  the land provisions other than section CB 11, for land acquired on or after 6 October 2009; and
3.  section CB 11, for land on which improvements are begun on or after 6 October 2009.

Tax Administration Act 1994: Cross-references to sections 108 and 109
---------------------------------------------------------------------

#### _Sections 93(2)(b), 94(2)(b), (c), 95(2)(b), 97(3)(a), 97B(3)(a), 98(2)(a), 98B(3)(a), 99(2)(a), (b), 100(3)(b), 101(2)(a) and 101B(2)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

Sections 93(2)(b), 94(2)(b), (c), 95(2)(b), 97(3)(a), 97B(3)(a), 98(2)(a), 98B(3)(a), 99(2)(a), (b), 100(3)(b), 101(2)(a) and 101B(2)(a) are being amended to correct a cross-referencing error within section 94(2)(b) noted in a recent court decision. The other provisions listed are consequentially amended for consistency.

### Background

In a recent court decision,[3](#03)
 it was identified that section 99(2)(a), in seeking to cross-refer to section 108, used language that did not appear in section 108. The same cross-referencing problem arises in a number of provisions from section 93 to section 101B of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Similar drafting issues arise from the use of the term "taxpayer" in a number of provisions from section 93 to section 101B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that refer to section 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This is because the term "taxpayer" no longer appears in section 109.

### Application date

The amendments apply from 1 October 1996.

### Detailed analysis

Section 99 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 enables the Commissioner to assess a person for RWT if the Commissioner considers that person has not paid the correct amount of RWT. Under the RWT rules, a person paying resident withholding income is required to withhold RWT and pay to the Commissioner the amount of RWT withheld on a periodic basis.

The reference in section 99(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to section 108(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is to ensure that the Commissioner cannot amend an earlier RWT assessment outside the time-bar period. Peters J's comments in the _Vinelight_ decision highlight a technical problem that the time bar may not apply to RWT assessments. Peters J identified a remedial issue within section 99 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, concerning the relationship of section 99 to section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This finding was endorsed in the later Court of Appeal decision in the same case. In the High Court, Peters J stated:

*   There is an obvious difficulty with s 99(2)(a), because s 108(1) does not include the words "income tax for any year". \[100\]

The judge's comments in the _Vinelight_ decision highlight a technical problem that the time bar may not apply to resident withholding tax (RWT) assessments. The words identified by Peters J, "income tax for any income year", were repealed in 1996 as part of the reforms of the disputes resolution legislation. Section 99 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 was not updated at that time to reflect the new wording in section 108(1).

Section 108(1) imposes a time limit (time bar) on the Commissioner's power to amend an earlier assessment of income tax. That time-bar period is four years after the end of the tax year in which the earlier assessment was made.

Section 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that disputable decisions are treated as correct unless a challenge is lodged against that decision, but the provision no longer uses the word "taxpayer". Disputable decisions include assessments by the Commissioner and most decisions of the Commissioner in relation to the application of a tax law to a taxpayer's circumstances.

This drafting issue also arises from these provisions not being updated correctly in 1996 to reflect the amended wording in sections 109.

These amendments are solely to correct the cross-reference wording into either section 108 or section 109 and do not change the effect of the current law.

Disposal of certain shares by a PIE
-----------------------------------

#### _Section CB 26 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Section CB 26 has been amended so that it does not apply in relation to dividends from a listed PIE.

By way of background, section CX 55 provides that gains arising from the sale of most Australian and New Zealand-listed shares are excluded income for PIEs and similar entities. However, section CB 26 deems a taxable dividend to arise when a share that satisfies the criteria of section CX 55 is sold after a dividend is declared but before the dividend is paid. This is to prevent a PIE turning a taxable dividend receipt into a non-taxable gain on sale.

These concerns do not arise for dividends received from listed PIEs as those dividends are not taxable in any event. There is no tax advantage in selling a share in a listed PIE after a dividend is declared but before it is paid. There is therefore no need for section CB 26 to apply to dividends from a listed PIE as the unimputed portion of such dividends are not taxable under section CX 56C.

### Application date

The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2013-14 income year.

Trusts that are Local and Public Authorities
--------------------------------------------

#### _Sections CW 38 and CW 39 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Amendments to sections CW 38 and CW 39 clarify that an amount derived by a trustee for a local authority or a public authority constituted as a trust:

*   does not enjoy the exempt income status under sections CW 38 or CW 39 if that amount is retained and included in trustee income of the trustee; and
*   is exempt income if that amount is distributed to a beneficiary that itself is exempt from income tax in relation to that distribution.

### Background

The Income Tax Act 2007 currently exempts from tax any amount derived by a local authority and a public authority other than "an amount received in trust". The exact meaning of these words is unclear and their interpretation has caused difficulty for taxpayers and Inland Revenue.

The policy is that this exemption should not extend to amounts that a local authority receives as a trustee. However, if the trustee receives an amount as trustee for a beneficiary which itself enjoys exempt income status, the trustee may take that exemption into account in meeting the trustee's income tax obligations for the beneficiary.

### Application date

The amendment applies from 30 June 2014, being the date of enactment.

### Detailed analysis

The amendments to sections CW 38 and CW 39 address questions raised with the Commissioner relating to the trustee's tax obligations for the beneficiary of a trust for which a local or public authority is the trustee.

The amendment clarifies, for the avoidance of doubt, that income derived by a local or public authority as trustee on the terms of a trust is to be treated as follows:

*   the exemption for income derived by a public authority or a public authority does not extend to income derived in the capacity as trustee that has not been distributed; and
*   the trustee may take into account an exemption from income of the beneficiary for determining the trustee's income tax obligations on that beneficiary income under other provisions of the 2007 Act.

1 Section 50 of the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013 amended section EW 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 from 27 September 2012 unless a taxpayer had taken a tax position.

2 The date the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013 received Royal assent.

"Other revenues" does not include capital amounts
=================================================

2014 case note – High Court held that 'other revenues' does not include capital amounts – capital, 'derived from'.

Case

Vector Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary

Vector Limited ("Vector") received lump sum payments for a license to access its tunnel and a share in its easements. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") considered the payments to be assessable as "other revenues" under s CC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("the ITA"). The High Court held that the payments were capital amounts, and that "other revenues" does not include amounts of capital.

### Impact of decision

"Other revenues" in s CC 1(2)(g) of the ITA is not intended to tax amounts of a capital nature.

The Commissioner has appealed this decision.

### Facts

The plaintiff (Vector) is an electricity distribution company. Vector owns two electricity distribution networks in the greater Auckland region and derives its income from lines charges. Vector owns various assets including an underground tunnel, easements and freehold land in what is known as the North Shore Transmission Corridor ("NSTC") through which Vector runs its cables.

Transpower New Zealand Ltd ("Transpower") manages and operates the national electricity transmission grid in New Zealand.

Transpower wished to use Vector's infrastructure to upgrade its works. Transpower entered into an agreement with Vector whereby Vector granted Transpower, among other things, a share of its easement rights in the NSTC "(Northern Easements") and an access right to occupy part of Vector's Tunnel ("Southern Access Right"). Transpower paid Vector $3,113,561.64 for the Northern Easements and $50,000,000.00 (plus GST) for the Southern Access Right (the payments).

In the 2011 and 2012 income tax years, Vector returned one-sixth of the payments, being $8,852,260.30 per year as income under s CC 1 of the ITA (Vector spread the payments over six years under s EI 7 of the ITA). Vector then issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment proposing to adjust its assessable income on the basis that the payments were non-taxable capital receipts. After attending a conference, the parties agreed that the dispute should be truncated and the matter referred to the court for determination.

### Decision

Faire J found that "other revenues" in s CC 1(2)(g) of the ITA did not include capital amounts (at \[58\]). He said that "other revenues" captured amounts that are income, but are not covered by s CC 1(2)(a)-(f). In support of this conclusion, his Honour pointed to the following factors:

1.  the plain meaning of "revenue" is income (at \[48\]);
2.  where Parliament intends to tax capital it must use clear language to do so (at \[48\]);
3.  the general purpose of the ITA is to tax income. An amount of capital is not otherwise included in a person's income unless Parliament has intended that to be so by a specific provision - New Zealand does not have a general all-purpose capital gains tax (at \[54\]);
4.  treating "other revenues" as meaning any amount derived from a lease, license or easement would make s CC 1(2) redundant, but the Courts must give effect to the words Parliament has used (at \[55\]); and
5.  the wider context suggests that payments for the grant or transfer of certain rights to land were not included in s CC 1 (at \[57\]).

Therefore, whether s CC 1 of the ITA applied in this case was answered by determining whether the payments were of a capital or income nature. In deciding that the payments were capital, Faire J applied the principles from _BP Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia_ \[1966\] AC 224 (PC) and _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v McKenzies (NZ) Ltd_ \[1988\] 2 NZLR 736 (CA).

Faire J found that the payments from Transpower were not part of Vector's income-earning process (at \[58\]). His Honour accepted Vector's submission that it had effectively permanently given up part of its income-producing asset in exchange for a lump sum payment (at \[69\]).

Faire J noted that the Commissioner was correct that Vector had not legally disposed of its rights to those parts of the tunnel and NSTC that are subject to the agreement with Transpower. However, his Honour found that this was not necessary and that the payments were of a once and for all nature producing advantages to Transpower which were enduring. His Honour concluded that the payments were of a capital nature (at \[69\]).

#### _Other issues_

Although the finding that the payments were not "other revenues" for the purposes of s CC 1 of the ITA was enough to dispose of the case, Faire J went on to briefly express his views on the other two issues.

_Is the payment derived "from a lease, license or easement affecting the land"?_  
Faire J found that the rights which were acquired under the easements and the licence are inseparable from the easements and the licence (at \[84\]). The payment for those rights was, therefore, "derived from" the licence or easements.

_Is the Northern Consideration Amount able to be apportioned?_  
Faire J was not satisfied that Vector had discharged its onus of providing an appropriate basis for apportionment even if apportionment was possible (at \[85\]). He said that if it had been necessary to determine the apportionment issue, there may have been justification for granting leave to address further submissions and evidence on it.

[Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2007](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-amendment-act-2007 "Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2007")

Other technical amendments
==========================

2007 technical amendments to the Student Loans Act on refunds of over payments, advising absence from NZ, overseas employment exemptions and more.

### Refunds of over-payments when assessments are reopened

##### Section 58A of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992

Section 58A(1) ensures that if a borrower's repayment obligation is reduced upon reassessment by the Commissioner, he or she can claim a refund of the difference in the assessed repayment obligations. The borrower has six months from being notified by the Commissioner of the difference in the assessed repayment obligations to claim a refund. The changes apply to any tax year.

### Advising of absence from new Zealand

##### Section 37 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992

Section 37 specifies that a borrower must inform the Commissioner if he or she expects to be, or has been, overseas for more than six months (previously this was three months). The change applied from 1 April 2007.

### Overseas employment exemption

##### Section 38AH of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992

The words "derived from New Zealand" have been inserted into section 38AH(c)(i) to ensure that borrowers entitled to a full interest write-off on the basis that they are overseas for more than six months because of the nature of their employment must have salary or wages that are derived from New Zealand. The change applied from 28 March 2007, except for borrowers who applied to the Commissioner for a full interest write-off before the amendment came into effect. For these borrowers, the change comes into force on 1 April 2008.

### Interest-free student loans for new borrowers

##### Section 38AL of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992

Section 38AL gives the Commissioner the discretion to grant new borrowers a full interest write-off for up to 183 days from the date they first become a borrower. The changes make it possible for new borrowers who have gone overseas briefly during the first six months from when they initially drew down a loan to be entitled to an interest-free loan from the day the loan was drawn down. Section 65A allows borrowers to object to a decision made by the Commissioner not to grant an interest write-off or to object to the dates on which the interest write-off applies to. The amendments came into force on 1 April 2006.

### Transitional provisions repealed

##### Sections 89 to 102 and section 112 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992

The heading to Part 7 and transitional provisions in sections 89 to 102 relating to assessments and repayments for tax years before 1 April 1994 have been repealed because they are redundant. The changes apply from 1 April 2007. Section 11 ensures that Tax Administration Act provisions continue to have effect. The changes applied from 28 March 2007.

### Removal of information match between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Education

##### Section 62 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, section 307C of the Education Act 1989, section 85D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and Schedule 3 of the Privacy Act 1993

Sections 62(2)(ab) and 62(2AA) of the Student Loan Scheme Act and section 85D of the Tax Administration Act have been repealed, and section 307C of the Education Act 1989 and Schedule 3 of the Privacy Act 1993 have been amended. The changes are necessary because the information match between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Education to verify borrowers' study status has been abolished. This data match is now redundant, because the full interest write-off for borrowers who are studying has been abolished. The changes came into force on 1 April 2007.

### Repayment deductions

##### Section 19 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992

Section 19(2) ensures that an employer is required to make a deduction from a borrower's salary or wages only if the employer is aware that a special deduction rate applies. The change came into force on 28 March 2007.

### Commissioner to assess borrower's repayment obligation

##### Section 15 (1) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992

Section 15(1) has been repealed and replaced. The Commissioner must make an assessment of a borrower's repayment obligation for a tax year as soon as practicable after the borrower provides his or her return of income for that year under the Tax Administration Act, or details of his or her gross income in accordance with section 14A (described under "Simplifying the law on which repayment rules apply").

### Interest statements

##### Section 43 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992

Section 43 has been amended to remove any doubt that Inland Revenue may issue an amended interest statement if the amount of interest previously charged is found to be incorrect. The change came into force on 28 March 2007.

### Charging late payment penalties

##### Section 44B of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992

The change, which came into force on 1 April 1992, being the date the student loan scheme was introduced, ensures that amounts which have become overdue, and thus subject to late payment penalties, are not also subject to interest.

The change was necessary because a change to the contract in 2005, under which interest is charged, failed to include the provision which ensured that interest ceases to be charged once a payment becomes overdue and thus subject to late payment penalties.

Tō mātou ara hoko mai Our buying approach
=========================================

The way we buy goods and services at Inland Revenue will vary depending on the nature, value, risk and complexity of the buying requirement. We will use the most appropriate sourcing approach in the circumstances, within the following frameworks:

*   Inland Revenue’s Buying and Expenses Policy
*   The Five Principles of Government Procurement
*   The Government Procurement Charter
*   The Government Procurement Rules (where applicable)

You can find more information on the 5 Principles of Government Procurement, the Charter and the Rules on the New Zealand Government Procurement website.

[Principles, charter and rules (New Zealand Government Procurement)](https://www.procurement.govt.nz/principles-charter-and-rules/)

Use of Government contracts
---------------------------

Under the Government Procurement Rules, we must use and buy from All-of-Government and common capability contracts. We can also buy from a supplier on an All-of-Government panel, where a panel exists, unless there is a good reason not to buy from these places.

Open market sourcing
--------------------

We will advertise contract opportunities that are being openly sourced on the Government Electronic Tender Service (GETS).

We will indicate our intentions for open market sourcing as a ‘future procurement opportunity’ on GETS. Future procurement opportunities are not a commitment from us to buy any goods and services, nor are they an invitation for suppliers to send us proposals/quotes. We may revise or cancel future procurement opportunities at any time.

Not all our contract opportunities will be advertised on GETS. For example, there may be a buying requirement that could be met through using a Government contract.

Tax compliance
--------------

Our suppliers have the same rights and responsibilities as any of our other customers. However, because of our role in maintaining the integrity of the tax system, it’s important that the tax affairs of our suppliers are in order. This includes accurate and timely tax returns and payments or ensuring they are under arrangement by the due date.

Our suppliers may be asked to confirm that their tax affairs are in order. This could form part of a contract with us, the terms and conditions of their engagement with us, or it could be a separate form to complete.

### Tax and criminal checks

We expect suppliers to complex tax and criminal checks on behalf of personnel they provide to work with us, whether as a consultant or a contractor, as a provider of support for our systems and data, or as supplier of services to or in our sites. In some cases, we may do this on your behalf, with your permission.

### Conflict of interest and confidentiality

Suppliers and their personnel working with us may be asked to complete a conflict of interest declaration and sign a confidentiality agreement about their work with us.

### Code of conduct

Suppliers and their personnel need to comply with our policies. Personnel need to comply with our Code of Conduct and Remote Working Policy.

We may conduct checks from time to time to confirm compliance with our policies and requirements.

Our policies
------------

Our suppliers need to comply with our policies, including the:

*   End User Policy 2024
*   Remote Access Travel Security Policy
*   Application and Cloud Security Policy
*   Infrastructure Security Policy
*   Identity, Authentication Access Management Policy
*   Security Operations Policy
*   Third Party Security Management Policy
*   Code of Conduct
*   Remote Working Policy.

Please email to request copies of these policies.

Kei te hihia ā mātou kiritaki kia māmā ake te utu i ā rātou take me ngā utunga otirā kia tūturu ake Our customers want us to keep making tax and social policy payments simpler and more certain
================================================================================================================================================================================================

IR has a relationship with nearly every individual and business in New Zealand and hundreds of thousands of customers living overseas. We focus on making tax and student loan obligations simple to pay, supporting individuals and families through making social policy payments and helping New Zealanders save for their first home or retirement. 

It’s important to our individual customers that we: 

*   send out annual tax assessments quickly and explain things clearly 
*   help people pay what they should on time
*   make it straightforward to set up a plan for repaying an overdue debt. 

3.5 million customers 

*   received an automatically issued individual income tax assessment in the tax year to March 2023[1](#note1)
    .

3.4 million KiwiSaver members 

*   were enrolled in the scheme at 30 June 2024. We transferred $10.4 billion to scheme providers to invest in 2023–24. 

618,000 student loan borrowers

*   made $1.6 billion in repayments this year. 

$328 million in donation tax credits 

*   went to 313,000 customers in 2023–24.

* * *

Families receive social policy payments that we deliver along with MSD and MBIE.

Some families may be facing hardship, managing complex circumstances or unsure about the payments they’re entitled to.

Families and whānau want us to:

*   give them certainty about the payments they receive from week to week
*   take the time to understand their situations and work through options for receiving entitlements or paying child support.

Along with MSD, IR distributed:

*   $3.1 billion in net entitlements to support working families this year.
*   145,000 children were supported by the Child Support Scheme.
*   $480 million in child support was collected from more than 127,000 parents in 2023–24 and $413 million was distributed to carers.
*   $642 million in paid parental leave payments went to around 54,000 new parents.

All New Zealand businesses interact with IR. As well as paying tax, businesses play a key role in the tax and social policy system by providing us with employment information and collecting tax and social policy payments such as student loans and child support for their staff. 

Small businesses want dealing with IR to be as simple and efficient as possible. We’re focused on reducing their compliance effort.

Providing certainty and clarity for companies is critical so they can manage their tax obligations. 

It’s important that we:

*   help new businesses get their tax right from the start
*   reduce the effort and uncertainties involved in paying tax
*   understand their circumstances if they’re going through difficulties
*   make it easy to advise us about any significant loss of income or set up an instalment arrangement to pay a debt.

250,000 employers

*   filed more than 7.2 million employer information returns in 2023–24. 

708,000 customers

*   were registered for GST at some point in 2023–24. They filed 3.19 million GST returns.

435,000 company returns

*   were filed in the 2023 tax year.[1](#note1)
    

* * *

One of the ways that we keep customers at the centre of our services is through our customer research panel, IR Connection.

IR Connection is an 18,000-strong community who represent all customer groups and product users, including traditionally hard-to-reach customers such as new migrants and people living with disabilities.

Through the panel, IR learns about customers’ experiences, motivations and needs. This year, members have shared their views on a range of key topics, including:

*   looking at ways to optimise the electronic notifications we send to customers when there is an action they need to take or information to read
*   helping our policy teams understand how donation tax credits are working for customers. 

We are grateful for IR Connection members’ time and valuable contributions. 

* * *

1Figures for the tax year ended March 2024 are not available for this Annual Report because some customers who use tax agents have until April 2025 to file their 2024 returns.

Our finances (2023)
===================

As part of our transformation programme, we committed to being approximately 25% to 30% smaller from an administration perspective, all things being equal. We have achieved this commitment. 

Remuneration and inflationary cost pressures have been and will be our key financial risks. Our current financial position will help lessen the level of this risk

Departmental appropriations

Each year, we receive funding from the Government to deliver services under 3 departmental appropriations.

An appropriation is a parliamentary authorisation for the Government or an Office of Parliament to incur expenses or capital expenditure. Expenditure can only be incurred under an appropriation or other statutory authority.

**2022-23 Appropriations**

We were funded through 3 appropriations in 2022-23.

*   Services to Other Agencies - $2m.
*   Residual Activities Transformation annual appropriation - $33m
*   Services for Customers multi-category appropriation - $700m.

The total budgeted appropriation for 2022–23 was $735 million. Our actual spend was $691 million, $44 million lower.

This underspend was partly due to challenges recruiting staff in the tight labour market and the timing of residual transformation activities.

Some of this underspend will be transferred to 2023–24, subject to confirmation by ministers.

Operating expenditure

Our operating expenditure against appropriations including remeasurements (expenditure that does not require an appropriation) was $704 million. It covers spending on personnel (56% of the total), operating (34%), depreciation including amortisation and impairment (7%) and capital charge (3%).

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |2022-23 Expenditure by category ($ millions)
| Year | Personnel | Operating | Depreciation and amortisation | Capital charge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2021-22 | $373 | $236 | $50 | $24 |
| 2022-23 | $395 | $238 | $48 | $23 |

Total personnel costs were for our people’s remuneration, employee entitlements and training and development costs. New collective agreements incorporating the outcome of the Public Sector Pay

Adjustment increased this spending in 2022–23 and will do so in outyears.

Operating costs this year mainly related to information technology, telecommunications, accommodation leases, contractors, consultants and office expenses.

Operating expenditure on contractors and consultants fell to $42 million in 2022–23 from $75 million in 2021–22. This reflects reduced requirements for contractors and consultants now that the transformation programme has ended.

The ratio of contractors and contractor operating expenditure to workforce operating spend was 10.3% in 2022–23 compared to 17.6% last year.

Capital expenditure

We spent $40 million on capital investments ($35 million in 2021–22) primarily on technology, software development and leasehold improvements.

Our future outlook

Our operating appropriation for 2023–24 is forecast to be $738 million, an increase of

$47 million from 2022–23. 

In terms of capital expenditure, Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue is maintaining capital reserves, funded from annual depreciation for technology and other upgrades and replacements.

Getting the best public value from what we buy

Like other government agencies, Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue considers social, environmental, cultural and economic outcomes when sourcing goods and services. Our key considerations around these broader outcomes when we go to market include:

*   increasing New Zealand businesses’ access to government contract opportunities, including supplier diversity
*   supporting quality employment outcomes for potentially disadvantaged groups
*   helping to improve conditions for New Zealand workers
*   reducing carbon emissions.

We report on the awarding of contracts to suppliers who have self-selected as a Māori business. Our result this year improved slightly from 0.96% of contracts to 1.78%. Because of the market we operate in, we’re unlikely to improve this result. We’re continuing to identify Maori businesses where possible and raise awareness within our organisation.

We also track timeliness in paying invoices to domestic suppliers as a way of ensuring we’re paying businesses quickly for their services. This year, 96.6% of the 10,200 invoices received were processed within our target of 10 working days.

*   $691m in operating expenditure against appropriations to deliver outcomes in 2022-23. In 2022 this was $685m.
*   $40m in capital investment in 2022-23.
*   96.6% is the percentage of domestic invoices paid within 10 working days, against a target of 95%. In 2022 this was 91.3%.
*   1.8% of our contracts (based on purchase orders issued) were awarded to Māori businesses to March 2023. This was 0.8% in 2022.

Our prosecution guidelines
==========================

Introduction
------------

Prosecution is one way the Commissioner of Inland Revenue protects the integrity of the tax and social policy systems she is statutorily responsible for. It is an enforcement activity, usually of last resort, applied in conformity with the Solicitor-General's Prosecution Guidelines supplemented by these Guidelines, against those who refuse to comply with their tax or social policy obligations or who abuse benefits. The sanction of criminal conviction and punishment assures compliant taxpayers, who indirectly bear the burden of others non-compliance, that the Commissioner will take enforcement action against non-compliers.

These Guidelines set out:

*   their link to Inland Revenue's strategic goals and direction
*   the types of non-compliance that may result in a decision to prosecute
*   the factors, in addition to those in the Solicitor-General's Guidelines, that may influence a decision to prosecute
*   the choice of charges
*   the Commissioner's approach to publicising prosecution results
*   the Commissioner's approach to measuring prosecution activity.

These Guidelines are designed to ensure a consistent approach to IR prosecutions nationally.

The link to Inland Revenue's strategic goals and direction
----------------------------------------------------------

Inland Revenue's strategic direction is directed at:

*   contributing to the economic and social well-being of New Zealanders by collecting and re-distributing money;
*   making revenue available to fund government programs through people meeting payment obligations of their own accord;
*   people receiving entitlements that enable them to participate in society.

Compliant customers:

*   register with Inland Revenue when the law requires them to
*   provide complete and accurate information
*   file returns and other information required by law on time
*   pay correct amounts on time
*   claim and receive only what they are entitled to.

### Inland Revenue's compliance model

Compliance for Inland Revenue is when customers pay the taxes and get the entitlements they should.

We want to help customers get it right from the start, rather than correct them when they get it wrong. Central to this is better understanding our customer’s needs and behaviours in a way that enables the Commissioner to consider and apply a much wider range of approaches to assist customers comply - being more proactive and making it simpler and more certain for customers.

Our new compliance model is part of Inland Revenue’s transformation journey and strategic direction. It comprises three moveable wheels that integrate customer behaviours (the inner circle), principles (the middle circle) and activities (the outer layer) in a way that helps us think more widely about customer needs and behaviours and tailor the compliance approach most appropriate for them. We recognise that most customers comply most of the time and we want to continue to encourage and facilitate this using our new compliance model to help build an environment that supports customers _right from the start._

![Compliance model](/-/media/project/ir/tt/images/compliance-model.jpg?modified=20211122232207) 

Unfortunately, some customers choose not to comply with their obligations or intentionally seek to mis-represent their personal or business circumstances in order to reduce the tax they are required to pay, or to obtain refunds, claims or entitlements they are not eligible for.  In these contexts, the Commissioner may seek to enforce compliance through prosecution actions as part of her statutory responsibility to protect the integrity of the tax and social policy laws entrusted to her.  

These prosecution guidelines support these statutory responsibilities by describing the parameters that are designed to ensure prosecution:

*   Is an appropriate, consistent and fair response for the type and level of non-compliance identified
*   Positively influences future compliance by appropriate publication of convictions
*   Is an integral component of a balanced compliance programme
*   Recognises and affirms positive compliance behaviors and norms.

The types of non-compliance that may result in a decision to prosecute
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Commissioner may prosecute criminal non-compliance in the tax and social policy areas she administers (listed in the schedule to the Tax Administration Act 1994 \[‘TAA'\]), consistently with s6 and 6A of that Act. She may also formulate, where appropriate, charges under other Acts, e.g. the Crimes Act.

The Commissioner works with other law enforcement agencies to deal with non-compliance. Subject to s18D of the TAA and relevant protocols, the Commissioner may refer cases to the Serious Fraud Office or the New Zealand Police.

### Types of non-compliance that justify prosecution

Examples of non-compliant behaviours that may justify prosecutions are:

*   non-filing of returns when due with intent to evade assessment and payment of liabilities, including child support
*   falsifying documents intended to be provided to the Commissioner
*   false representations to the Commissioner (including by concealment of or failure to provide relevant information)
*   obstruction of the Commissioner in the execution of her duties
*   misuse of revenue held in trust, such as PAYE, GST, Student Loan deductions, and employee KiwiSaver contributions
*   failure to make deductions required by law, e.g. PAYE or child support
*   false refund/deduction/rebate claims against the Commissioner
*   laundering the proceeds of offences against the Revenue.

The Commissioner may also prosecute third parties for aiding, abetting, or conspiring in, the commission of criminal conduct or for inciting, counselling or procuring tax payers to engage in such conduct.

### Voluntary disclosures and their effect on prosecutions

The Commissioner will not normally prosecute a taxpayer where the taxpayer has made a pre-notification voluntary disclosure as defined in section 141G of the TAA ([SPS19/02](/standard-practice-statements/shortfall-penalties/sps-1902-voluntary-disclosures)
 paragraphs 91 and 93) in respect of that person's tax position. This is not a rule of law, but a policy decision made to encourage voluntary compliance in the spirit of the reduction in shortfall penalty that accompanies a voluntary disclosure.

In circumstances where the Commissioner forms the view that a taxpayer’s actions or omissions are such that non-prosecution could lead to voluntary compliance more generally being undermined, the Commissioner may still proceed with that subsequent prosecution action. A decision to prosecute in these circumstances will be rare and limited to serious offences.

Factors additional to those in the _Solicitor-General's Prosecution Guidelines_ that may influence a decision to prosecute
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Solicitor General's Prosecution Guidelines

The _Solicitor-General's Prosecution Guidelines_ emphasize several points of a prosecution system operating under the rule of law in a democratic society. The first is that the prosecutor must be free of pressure from sources not properly part of the prosecution decision-making process. The second deals with the prosecution decision itself. Under New Zealand's common law adversarial system, a prosecutor must be satisfied of two things: (i) that the Evidential Test is met, i.e. that there is evidence sufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction, and (ii) that the Public Interest test is met, i.e. that only those breaches of the criminal law where the public interest warrants a prosecution will proceed to that step.

### The Evidential Test

The Evidential Test is fundamental. There must never be a prosecution without evidence providing a reasonable prospect of conviction.

### The Public Interest Test

The _Solicitor-General's Prosecution Guidelines_ on the Crown Law website includes an illustrative list of Public Interest considerations. They apply to all Inland Revenue cases. They are not repeated here.

Read the [Solicitor-General's Prosecution Guidelines](https://www.crownlaw.govt.nz/publications/prosecution-guidelines/)

### The Commissioner's Public Interest factors

In addition to the Solicitor-General's Public Interest factors, the Commissioner also considers the following revenue-specific factors.

Factors favouring prosecution are:

*   conformity with IR compliance strategies, especially current risk factors (e.g. hiding profits of real estate sales or failing to declare cash jobs/sales)
*   a history of non-compliance (not restricted to previous convictions)
*   the degree of non-compliance (e.g. the gravity & prevalence of offending)
*   loss to the Revenue (greater loss = more reason to prosecute)
*   damage to the integrity of the Revenue (e.g. attempts to undermine the administration of the Revenue Acts)
*   misuse of corporate entities for a criminal tax purpose (e.g. phoenixing or using multiple entities to facilitate GST fraud)
*   organised and systematic attacks on the tax or social policy systems, (e.g. planned and sustained programs of tax evasion or false GST claims)

Factors against prosecution are:

*   the availability of effective alternatives to prosecution (e.g. where a defaulter has made good the losses to the Revenue, has paid any interest, and the educational/compliance/integrity/deterrence aspect is met by imposition (i.e. assessment) of a suitable civil \[e.g. evasion, promoter or obstruction shortfall\] penalty)
*   where alternatives to prosecution are available and a prosecution, though still justifiable, would consume resources that could be better used elsewhere.

The choice of charges
---------------------

### Substantive matters

Though generally the TAA is more suited to prosecuting tax evasion _(Gilchrist v R_ \[2007\] 1 NZLR 499), some tax offending is better dealt with under the Crimes Act (_R v Morris_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,217). Many offences against the Revenue fall within the definitions of crimes in both Acts. The crimes in Part 10 of the CA are particularly suited to Revenue offending. They deal with generally dishonest conduct, including false representations, crimes involving computers and money laundering. Sections in other Parts may be used as appropriate.

The choice of charges depends on the evidence, the avoidance of technicalities and the ease of explaining specific crimes to juries. Public interest factors also bear on the choice of charges. A serious obstruction of the Commissioner may be more suitably prosecuted as perverting, obstructing or defeating the course of justice under the Crimes Act rather than obstructing the Commissioner under section 143H TAA.

### Procedural matters

Section 150 of the TAA authorises Inland Revenue, unlike other institutions with prosecution functions, to include more than one of certain TAA charges in a charging document. This provision is used for convenience and administrative ease, as revenue offending often involves multiple repeated conduct, in which only the date of offending is materially different. Each charge remains a separate count. The Commissioner will almost invariably apply this section when charging someone with qualifying TAA offending.

Section 20(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 (CPA) provides for representative charges. This provision allows multiple offences of the same type to be included in a single count in a charging document if the offending occurs in similar circumstances such that the defendant would be likely to enter the same plea to the charges if they were charged separately, and the number of offences would make it difficult for the court to manage if charged separately but tried together. The Commissioner will consider whether the facts of a case make representative charges appropriate.

In suitable cases the Commissioner may file charges in the alternative or use the included offence provision of the CPA (section 143).

### Categories of offences

There are only two types of hearing: judge-alone trials and jury trials. All charges fall under 4 categories of offence, each with slightly different procedures. The crimes that the Commissioner may prosecute are Category 1 (punishable by fines), a few Category 2 offences (punishable by imprisonment for less than 2 years) or Category 3 offences (punishable by imprisonment for 2 years or more).

Category 1 and 2 offences are tried in the District Court before a judge alone. All but one of the offences in sections 143 and 143A of the TAA are Category 1 offences. The exception is section 143A(1)(d), which has a potential sentence of 5 years imprisonment, and which is therefore a Category 3 offence.

Category 3 offences are those punishable by imprisonment for 2 years or more that are not Category 4 offences. Category 3 offences are tried in the District Court unless there is an order transferring the case to the High Court. Defendants may elect trial by jury.

All TAA offences that are not Category 1 offences are Category 2 or 3 offences. The Crimes Act offences that the Commissioner will usually consider are all Category 3 offences.

Publicity
---------

The Commissioner may publicise convictions for tax offences based on public interest, including deterring future non-compliance, encouraging and reinforcing compliant behaviours and maintaining society's perception of the integrity of the tax and social policy systems.

Measuring prosecution activity
------------------------------

The Commissioner will periodically review:

*   the range and nature of IR prosecution cases
*   the outcomes of these cases
*   IR decision-making processes for robustness, impartiality and conformity with the law and IR strategies and responsibilities
*   the effective and efficient use of our resources in undertaking prosecution activities
*   the influence of these outcomes on compliance behaviour and protecting the integrity of the tax and social policy systems.
