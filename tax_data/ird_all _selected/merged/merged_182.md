Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1963
==============================================

Archived legislative commentary on Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1963 from PIB vol 3 Nov 1963.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 3, November 1963.

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

### Section 1 - Short Title

### Section 2 - Application

Provides that except where otherwise stated, the Act applies first to the income year commencing on 1 April 1963 (i.e. the income year ending 31 March 1964). In general, this includes the corresponding accounting year where the taxpayer balances to a date other than 31 March.

### Section 3 - Due Date For Furnishing Land Tax Returns

At present, annual returns of land are required to be furnished not later than 7 April each year. This section extends the time to 7 May each year, commencing from 1964 - i.e. returns of land held at noon on 31 March 1964 will not be required to be furnished until 7 May 1964.

### Section 4 - Donations And School Fees

This section amends Section 84B (inserted by Section 4 of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1962) by increasing the maximum allowable exemption from £25 to £50 in respect of school fees and donations to registered (non-profit) private schools or special schools for handicapped children. The present limit of £25 on all other qualifying donations remains. This means if a taxpayer does not pay school fees to a private school or a school for handicapped children, and does not make a donation to either of those types of school, the maximum allowable exemption is still £25.

Donations (as distinct from school fees) to private or handicapped children's schools will qualify for the £50 maximum exemption irrespective of whether or not the donor has a child attending either of those types of school.

In cases in which the £50 maximum applies, it is reducible by any amounts claimed in respect of qualifying donations to other than private schools or handicapped children's schools. Thus, if a person makes a qualifying donation (other than to the above types of school) amounting to £10, he could claim up to an additional £40 for school fees and/or donations to a private school or handicapped children's school.

The amendment applies commencing from the income year ending 31 March 1964 and may be illustrated as follows-

(A) School fees (tuition only) paid to a registered (non-profit) private school or to a special school for handicapped children.

(B) Donations to the above types of schools.

(C) Donations to other qualifying objects.

*   Where the only claim is under (C) the maximum that may be claimed is £25.
*   Where there is no claim under (C) (but there are claims under (A) or (B) or under both (A) and (B)) the maximum that may be claimed is £50.
*   Where there is a claim under (A) or (B), or both, and there is also a claim under (C) the maximum that may be claimed is £50, subject to (C) not exceeding £25.

### Section 5 - Exemption From New Zealand Tax Of Certain Companies Carrying On Business In Cook Islands or Niue

The section applies to companies carrying on business in the Cook Islands (including Niue) and which are not under the control of persons resident in New Zealand. Companies owned and operated in the Cook Islands, and incorporated in New Zealand because of the lack of facilities for incorporating companies in the Islands, pay Cook Islands tax. The section exempts them from paying New Zealand tax except on any income derived from sources in New Zealand.

The types of company to which this section relates are already exempt from excess retention tax under Section 172C(j) and (k) of the principal Act and likewise dividends flowing from those companies to shareholders who are resident in the Cook Islands or Niue are already exempt from New Zealand tax pursuant to Section 172A(7) of the principal Act.

Exemption does not apply, however to dividends declared by such a company in favour of individual shareholders who are resident in New Zealand. Any such dividends will be assessable to New Zealand tax in the same manner and to the same extent as any other dividends flowing from a New Zealand company to its shareholders.

### Section 6 - Exemption From Tax of Compensation Received under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1963

This section exempts from tax compensation received under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1963. This brings the position of such compensation into line with payments received under the Workers' Compensation Act. The exemption also applies to social security tax.

### Section 7 - Exemption from New Zealand Income Tax and Excess Retention Tax of Companies Deriving Income from "Development Projects" in Cook Islands, or Niue

This is a further amendment dealing with companies operating in the Cook Islands (including Niue). Section 5, as has already been mentioned, deals with companies owned (or controlled) by residents of the Cook Islands. Section 7 concerns New Zealand owned (or controlled) companies the sole or principal source of income of which is from a business or enterprise in the Cook Islands which is of importance to the development of those Islands. The amendment relieves such companies from paying extra income from Cook Islands, development projects declared to be such by Order-In-Council in New Zealand.

The section also provides from exemption from New Zealand excess retention tax.

However, dividends declared by such companies in favour of their shareholders will be assessable to New Zealand tax in their hands in the same manner and to the same extent as any other dividends flowing from a New Zealand company to its shareholders.

### Section 8 - Additional Depreciation on Plant, Machinery and Equipment Used Exclusively for Scientific Research

This new Section (113B of the principal Act) provides that where, on or after 1 April 1963, a taxpayer acquires, installs or extends any plant, machinery or equipment for use exclusively in scientific research directly relating to that taxpayer's business, the Commissioner may allow an additional deduction by way of depreciation so that the total cost price of the asset is written off over a period of five years.

In most cases this will simply mean a write-off at twenty percent of cost for each year, in which case there will be no need to claim separate amounts for ordinary and special depreciation, or to furnish an IR 39 (special depreciation claim form). In some cases, however, it is possible that in the first year or two of an asset's life, the combined total of normal special depreciation and ordinary depreciation rates would exceed twenty percent of cost, e.g. first year - special ten percent, ordinary fifteen percent. In such cases, if the taxpayer so desires, he may write off at normal rates in any year in which this would give him a greater benefit than the twenty percent of cost basis. Where this is done, normal procedures (including furnishing form IR 39) will apply until such time within the five year period as the taxpayer ceases to obtain a greater advantage than under these new provisions. From there on, the new provisions would be applied on the basis of allowing an equal spread of the balance of cost price over the remaining years.

##### Example

Cost of research asset £10,000

Rate of ordinary depreciation 15% dv

|     |     | Normal |     | 20% on cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cost** |     | £10,000 |     | £10,000 |
| 1st year's depreciation |     |     |     |     |
| Special | £1,000 |     |     |     |
| Ordinary | £1,000 | £2,500 | 20% cost | £2,000 |
| **Balance** |     | £7,500 |     | £8,000 |
| 2nd year's depreciation |     |     |     |     |
| Special | £ 500 |     |     |     |
| Ordinary 15% of £7,500) | £1,125 | £1,625 |     |     |
| Balance |     | £5,875 |     |     |

In the first year normal depreciation gives £2,500, compared with £2,000 on the twenty percent cost basis. The taxpayer could claim the £2,500 if desired.

In the second year, if the book value (£7,500) in divided equally into the four remaining years it gives a write-off of £1,875 per annum. As this is greater than the normal write-off (£1,625) the taxpayer can change over and claim £1,875 per annum for each of the years two to five.

The additional deduction is subject to Section 117 of the principal Act; therefore it can be recovered in the same manner as ordinary and special depreciation if the asset is sold at a price in excess of the tax written-down value. Normal requirements apply as to writing off depreciation in the taxpayer's books of accounts.

Any higher rate of deduction allowed under this section will also be allowed as a deduction for excess retention tax purposes.

### Section 9 - Special Depreciation

Extends the present special depreciation allowance on plant and machinery and buildings for employee accommodation for another year to 31 March 1965.

### Section 10 - Initial Depreciation

Similarly extends the twenty percent initial depreciation allowance on buildings for employee accommodation for a further year, to 31 March 1965. (This allowance is, of course, alternative to and not additional to special depreciation on such buildings.)

### Section 11 - Investment Allowance on New Manufacturing Plant and Machinery

This section together with Section 12 gives effect to the Budget proposal to grant a special investment allowance of ten percent on the cost of new manufacturing and agricultural plant and machinery. The taxpayer is allowed an additional deduction of ten percent of cost price in the first year of use of the asset, so that, in effect, he can write off 110 percent of the cost price of the asset over the term of its actual life, assuming it is then discarded.

If the asset is not scrapped, the allowance is greater than normal depreciation allowances by 10 percent of the cost.

The investment allowance in no way affects the rates or amounts of ordinary or special depreciation; it is allowable in addition to those claims and is not recoverable if the asset is subsequently sold at a price in excess of book value or even in excess of cost.

The allowance must not be written off the asset account - it should be claimed outside the books of account be adjustment on page 3 of the company return or on the IR 3B (business return) or the IR 3F (farming return) as the case may be. If, however, a taxpayer wished to keep his Profit and Loss Account net profit in line with his assessable income for taxation purposes, there would be no objection to the investment allowance being debited to Profit and Loss Account and credited to Profit and Loss Appropriation Account.

A full explanation of the terms of Section 11 is given in succeeding pages but in very general terms, the provisions may be summarised briefly as relating to plant or machinery which is -

(a) New - i.e., not second hand.

(b) Delivered to the taxpayer's premises on or after 1 August 1963 and on or before 31 March 1965 (subject to special provisions covering plant constructed on the taxpayer's premises).

(c) Used by the owner in carrying out any part of the processes of converting "goods" into "manufactured goods" or finishing off "manufactured goods" for sale or use.

(d) Used by the owner in certain specified processes which, although not strictly manufacturing processes , are listed as qualifying for the allowance.

(e) Used by the owner in certain specified ancillary processes, PROVIDED the owner of that plant also owns and uses other plant or machinery in one of the actual processes of manufacturing or finishing off .

The term "goods" (whether used alone or in conjunction with the term "manufactured") has its ordinary and generally accepted meaning. As, however, there may be some doubt whether the ordinary meaning would include "liquids, gases, substances and ships and aircraft" the inclusion of these has been specifically covered by definition.

Similarly, there may be some doubt whether the term "manufactured goods" would include goods manufactured for the purpose of use as parts or materials in the manufacture of other goods. Again this point has been specifically covered by definition.

##### Plan of the Legislation-

Section 11 inserts a new Section 117A in the principal Act. Subsection (4) in the operative provision which allows the deduction. The other subsections cover the following-

Subsection:

(1) General definitions. (Note that although a definition of "manufacturing plant or machinery" appears in subsection (1) this covers only a minor aspect of that term. The principal definitions of the types of plant or machinery to which the investment allowance applies are given in subsection (2) - see below.)

(2) (a) gives the main definition of "manufacturing good plant or machinery";

(2) (b) adds to the (2)(a) definition by including plant or machinery for certain processes that might not otherwise be strictly manufacturing processes;

(2) (c) and (d) add certain ancillary plant.

(3) Defines certain plant which it is desired to exclude (e.g. types of plant which are not really manufacturing but which could possible qualify is not specifically excluded.)

(4) Operative subsection.

(5) Plant used in producing exempt income.

(6) Commencing and ending dates.

(7) Operation of commencing and ending dates in relation to plant constructed on taxpayer's premises.

(8) Avoidance provision.

(9) Not to apply to expenditure on plant for which the taxpayer is reimbursed.

(10) Deduction additional to depreciation.

(11) Excludes farm development expenditure.

##### Assets which qualify-

(a) The asset must be "new" plant or machinery (hereafter referred to as "the asset") - not second-hand or used. Thus the allowance is granted only once in respect of the same item, irrespective of how many times it may change hands.

(b) The asset must be owned by the taxpayer claiming the allowance. On this point, assets being acquired under hire-purchase agreements will be treated as owned by the person acquiring it. Any assets merely leased by the person carrying out the manufacturing process will not qualify for the allowance to either that person or the owner.

(c) The asset must be used by the owner primarily, principally and directly -

(i) In any part of the manufacturing process carried out by him either on his own beha lf or on behalf of another person. (An example of the latter would be plant used by a taxpayer to apply chromium plating to metal sent to him by a manufacturer of metal goods. OR

(ii) In finishing off manufactured goods to bring them into the condition in which they are sold or used, whether or not the person applying the finishing process was also the manufacturer of the goods. ("Finishing off" includes processes such as polishing or painting the manufactured goods or the freezing of perishable manufactured goods but does not include packing, labelling, or placing in containers unless done by the actual manufacturer - see later paragraph. Note that an asset used for repairs, such as re-painting a used car, or re-treading tyres, or re-pairing shoes would not qualify although assets used in the original manufacture of such items would qualify.) OR

(iii) In the following processes which are deemed to be manufacturing processes -

*   concentration (see definitions in the section) of a metal or operation ancillary to that process. (Does not apply to a mining company assessable under section 152.);
*   refining of petroleum (does not apply to a petroleum mining company assessable under section 153);
*   scouring or carbonising wool. (Carbonising is a process whereby excessive seed content of wool is removed);
*   milling timber;
*   freezing primary products;
*   operations of printing, lithographing or engraving in the course of carrying on the business of a publisher, printer, lithographer or engraver;
*   curing meat or fish;
*   production of chilled or frozen meat;
*   pasteurising milk;
*   canning foodstuffs;
*   producing electric current, hydraulic power, steam, compressed air or gases (other than natural gas) for sale by the taxpayer or as a source of power etc., used primarily and principally for manufacturing plant operated by him.

OR

(iv) In the following ancillary operations carried out by the manufacturer (or partial manufacturer) of the goods. (Note - does not apply to assets used in these operations by an independent person who had nothing to do with the manufacture of the goods) -

*   packing, placing in containers, or labelling goods;
*   cleansing or sterilising bottles, vats or other containers used by the taxpayer for storage, delivery or marketing goods;
*   transportation or storage of the goods within the manufacturing premises, e.g. fork lifts, tractors, conveyor belts, storage cranes etc., but NOT road vehicles such as trucks, cars, vans, station wagons etc. even though such vehicles may be used wholly or partly in transporting goods within the manufacturing premises. ("Manufacturing premises" is not a defined term; it is used here merely for explanatory purposes and could be taken to mean the factory site or immediately adjacent premises. The intention is to cover initial transportation and storage to remove the goods from the "assembly line" (or other place where the manufacturing is done) but not subsequent transportation and storage which could be regarded as the start of the distribution process. Also to cover transportation of raw materials from the factory gate to the raw materials store and from the latter to the "assembly line" (or other place where the manufacturing is done).
*   disposal of waste substances resulting from a manufacturing process;
*   assembling, maintenance, cleansing, sterilising or repairing manufacturing plant or machinery.

##### Assets which do NOT qualify

(a) Assets used in mining or quarrying (except where in conflict with certain qualifying assets mentioned above).

(b) All road vehicles of the types ordinarily used for transporting people or transporting or delivering goods. (This includes cars, trucks and vans as well as vehicles designed especially to convey a particular type of goods, such as petrol trucks, beer tankers etc.)

(c) Assets used by a builder or other contractor to manufacture goods for use in the construction by him of roads, bridges, dams, buildings, and other structures. (This restriction applies where the owner or the plant is also the builder of the road, bridge, dam etc. If, for example, a taxpayer constructs a road and manufactures his own road sealing composition, the plant used in the manufacture of that composition would not qualify. Also, as the construction of a road is not the manufacture of goods, assets used in its construction would likewise not qualify. If, however, a taxpayer manufacturing road sealing composition merely supplies it to roadbuilders the plant used in manufacturing the composition would qualify, because-

(i) the making of the composition is the manufacture of goods, and

(ii) the owner of that sealing manufacturing plant is not himself constructing the road. The position is that one is a true manufacturer while the other is only partly so, and plant may be used for other purposes besides manufacture.

(d) Cooking appliances, or other plant and machinery used in the preparation of food or drink (on or off the premises) in hotels, boardinghouses, catering establishments, kitchens, cookhouses, restaurants, cafes, milk bars, coffee shops, retail shops or any similar establishments. This exclusion does not apply, however, to plant used in the production of food or drink in premises other than hotels, boardinghouses etc. listed above. For example, plant used in a bakery to manufacture bread or in a factory to manufacture soft drinks or biscuits will qualify as also will plant used by a brewery in the manufacture of beer. Plant in a bakery would not be disqualified simply because there was a retail shop attached which sold a small part of the output to the public.

(e) All plant or machinery of a kind ordinarily used for office work. This excludes from the allowance such assets as typewriters, dictaphones, accounting machines etc. notwithstanding that those assets may be used in the office of a manufacturing business.

(f) Containers, spools or other articles in or on which goods are to be delivered - i.e. reels on which wire is delivered or spools on which cotton is delivered. Note that although these items themselves do not constitute plant for the purposes of the allowance under any circumstances, the plant and machinery used in producing those containers etc. would qualify provided the plant is owned by the person manufacturing those items.

(g) Plant or machinery used in the production of electric current, hydraulic power, steam, compressed air, or gases UNLESS that current, power, steam etc. was used either-

(i) for sale by the taxpayer, or

(ii) for use by him primarily and principally to enable him to use other plant and machinery which qualifies for the allowance.

(h) Certain specified articles listed below UNLESS

(i) the particular unit cost more than £30 AND

(ii) depreciation on that article is allowable under Section 113 - i.e. it is not an article on which maintenance or replacement only is allowable. The list of items is: Blocks, bolsters, core boxes, dies, driers, flasks, gauges, jigs, lasts, matrixes, moulds, patterns, saggers, stereotypes, templets and tooling (including work-holding fixtures, working heads, and tool holders), and similar articles used for similar purposes.

(i) Hand tools and other loose tools.

(j) Any unit of plant and machinery costing the taxpayer less than £30.

##### Special provisions regarding Plant and Machinery purchased or Under Construction at commencement and finishing dates.

(a) Asset Purchased by Taxpayer

(i) Position at 1 August 1963

"Purchased" means that it is not manufactured or constructed on the taxpayer's premises but is bought by him to his requirements from another person and is received or taken into his manufacturing premises (hereafter referred to as "delivered") on or after 1 August 1963 and before 1 April 1965.

Where the plant or machinery is delivered to the taxpayer's manufacturing premises within those dates, the asset qualifies for the allowance provided it does not form part of plant and machinery to be constructed on his premises by another person, the contract for which was made before 1 August 1963.

(ii) Position at 31 March 1965

Where plant and machinery purchased by the taxpayer is first delivered after the 31 March 1965, the asset will qualify for the allowance PROVIDED the Commissioner is satisfied that:

(1) a binding contract for purchase of the asset was entered into on or before 31 March 1965 AND

(2) the date on which the contract for purchase was completed and the date on which the asset is delivered does not exceed such period as, on the opinion of the Commissioner, is reasonable in the circumstances of the particular case.

(b) Asset Constructed by Taxpayer himself

(i) Position at 1 August 1963

Where, on 1 August 1963, a taxpayer was himself constructing a new unit of plant and machinery on his manufacturing premises, any goods delivered to him prior to 1 August 1963 for incorporation in that new plant and machinery will not qualify for the investment allowance. Only those goods delivered on or after 1 August 1963 for incorporation in that plant or machinery will qualify.

(ii) Position at 31 March 1965.

Where, on 31 March 1965, a taxpayer is himself constructing a new unit of plant or machinery on his manufacturing premises (which he commenced to construct on or after 1 August 1963) any goods delivered to him after 31 March 1965 for incorporation in that plant or machinery will not qualify UNLESS the Commissioner is satisfied that-

*   a binding contract was entered into by all necessary parties on or before 31 March 1965
*   the period between the date on which the contract was completed and the date on which the goods concerned are incorporated in the unit of plant or machinery does not exceed such period as the Commissioner considers reasonable in the circumstances of the particular case.

(c) Asset Constructed for Taxpayer on his Premises by Another Person

(i) Position at 1 August 1963

Where

(1) a unit of plant or machinery is supplied to the taxpayer by another person under a contract made before 1 August 1963, and

(2) that unit is to become an integral part of plant or machinery which that other person agreed to construct on the taxpayer's premises (under either that same contract or another contract made before 1 August 1963), then any such units of plant or machinery will NOT qualify. Where a unit of plant or machinery is constructed by another person on the taxpayer's premises partly under a contract made before 1 August 1963 and partly under a contract made between 1 August 1963 and 31 March 1965, only the work performed and materials supplied under that latter contract would qualify for the allowance.

(ii) Position at 31 March 1965

Where, between 1 August 1963 and 31 March 1965, a taxpayer enters into a contract with another person for the construction of a unit of plant and machinery on the taxpayer's premises, and the contract is not completed by 31 March 1965, any work performed or materials supplied after 31 March 1965 will NOT qualify UNLESS that work has been performed and materials supplied not later than the Commissioner considers reasonable in the circumstances of the particular case. (Sub-section 8 covers the position where a contract was entered into with another person prior to 1 August 1963 for the construction of a unit or portion of a unit of plant or machinery on the taxpayer's premises and that contract is substituted by another (either with the same or a different person) so as to gain the advantage of the investment allowance. In such cases the Commissioner is empowered to either refuse to allow the whole allowance on the plant supplied under the substituted contract or may allow such part only as he thinks fit.)

##### Reimbursement of Cost Price of Asset

Where a taxpayer is reimbursed wholly or partly for expenditure he has incurred in acquiring new plant or machinery, the cost price for purposes of calculating the investment allowance is to be reduced by the amount of reimbursement.

##### Adjustment Where Asset Used only partly for Producing Assessable Income

In cases where a qualifying asset has, at any time during the income year (or accounting year), been used in producing exempt or non-assessable income, only that portion of the investment allowance relating to the use of the asset in producing assessable income is to be allowed as a deduction.

##### Losses

If a loss is sustained during the year in which the investment allowance is allowable as a deduction, the loss to be carried forward is to be increased by the amount of that allowance.

##### Excess Retention Tax

The amount of the allowance is permitted as a deduction in determining the distributable portion for excess retention tax purposes.

##### One Investment Allowance Only

Taxpayers entitled to an investment allowance in respect of farming and agricultural plant or machinery (Section 12) or a West Coast redevelopment project (Section 13) are not entitled to a further allowance under this section on that same plant and machinery.

##### Application

Note that the allowance relates to plant or machinery purchased on or after 1 August 1963 . This means that taxpayers with balance dates between 1 August and 30 September can claim the investment allowance for their 1963 income year if they acquired new qualifying plant or machinery on or after 1 August 1963 and on or before their 1963 balance dates.

### Section 12 - Investment Allowance on Plant and Machinery used for Farming and Agricultural Purposes

This section, with slight modifications, extends the terms of the previous section to plant and machinery used for any farming or agricultural business carried on by the owner in New Zealand or in performing services (such as agricultural contracting) involving the use of that plant or machinery. The type of assets on which the allowance is not granted are the same as those listed in the previous section, except that those which obviously cannot be classed as "farming or agricultural plant and machinery" are not stated.

In the case of "road vehicles", the same exclusions as under Section 11 apply. Tractors and implements qualify, but not trucks, landrovers etc. However, any vehicle designed and used exclusively

(i) for loading fertiliser or lime into topdressing aircraft, or

(ii) partly for carrying a vehicle designed and used for loading fertiliser or lime into topdressing aircraft and partly for carrying fuel for topdressing aircraft in a permanently attached tank

can qualify for the allowance provided the other conditions are fulfilled.

##### General

Subject to the specific exclusions it applies over the whole range of farming and agricultural plant and machinery.

The Section 11 provisions apply regarding plant or machinery purchased or under construction at the commencement and termination dates (i.e. 1 August 1963 and 31 March 1965).

An allowance under this section cannot be given in addition to that provided in the preceding section or the succeeding section.

### Section 13 - Investment Allowance on Assets for use in Redevelopment Projects on The West Coast

These provisions are aimed at encouraging the establishment of new industries on the West Coast of the South Island - the actual redevelopment areas are defined as being-

(a) the counties of Inangahua, Buller, Grey and Westland, and

(b) the boroughs of Westport, Runanga, Brunner, Greymouth, Kumara, Hokitika and Ross.

To qualify for this allowance, it is essential that the particular project be declared a "Redevelopment Project" by the Minister of Finance.

There are several important differences between this investment allowance and that relating to manufacturing plant (Section 11) and farming and agricultural plant (Section 12). As this is an incentive allowance to encourage redevelopment of the West Coast, the provisions are somewhat broader and more relaxed than those relating to the other allowances, the principal differences being-

(i) The allowance is 20% of cost price instead of 10%, which means the taxpayer can write off up to 120% of cost over the life of the asset.

(ii) It applies to any plant or machinery (except those items in (v) below) owned by the taxpayer for use in any redevelopment project in the above areas, or in performing services in relation to any redevelopment project in those areas. It is not confined solely to manufacturing plant or machinery, but applies to all plant and machinery used in or in relation to that project irrespective of the functions which those assets perform.

(iii) It applies to 'new' plant acquired or installed by the taxpayer after 11 July 1963 (i.e. Budget date) and on or before 31 March 1967. Note that the wording is similar to that used for special depreciation and whereas the two preceding sections of this Act relate, in general, merely to plant or machinery delivered on or after 1 August 1963 and on or before 31 March 1965, the present section permits the 20% investment allowance in certain circumstances where new plant or machinery is purchased prior to 12 July 1963 but is installed on or after that date. 'New' has the same definition as for the 10% allowance.

(iv) In addition to plant or machinery, the allowance can (with the approval of the Minister of Finance) also apply to buildings or extensions of buildings owned by the taxpayer in the redevelopment area and erected or extended after 11 July 1963 and on or before 31 March 1967 PROVIDED that the buildings are for use primarily, principally and directly in any redevelopment project or in performing services in relation to that project.

(v) Assets which do not qualify

(a) Motor cars or station wagons as defined in subsection (1) of Section 2 of the Transport Act 1962 - unless they are used as a passenger-service vehicle as defined in that section. The effect is that the investment allowance will apply to motor cars or station wagons ONLY if they are used as taxis, or service cars or are hired out by rental car firms (provided, of course, the particular activities are declared a redevelopment project by the Minister of Finance). Trucks, vans and other similar vehicles excluded from the other allowance can qualify under this section provided other necessary requirements are fulfilled.

(b) Blocks, bolsters. core boxes, dies, driers, flasks, gauges etc. and similar items in the same manner and to the same extent as the investment allowance on manufacturing plant and equipment.

(c) Non-depreciable assets - i.e., assets not subject to scale rates of depreciation.

(d) Hand tools and other loose tools.

(e) Any unit of plant or machinery costing less than £30.

The allowance does not apply to mining companies assessable under Section 152 or petroleum mining companies assessable under Section 153.

##### Apportionment of Allowance-

Provision is made for the apportionment of the 20% allowance in cases where the plant, machinery, buildings or extensions have been used-

(i) outside the redevelopment area and for purposes other than the redevelopment project or

(ii) partly in producing non assessable or exempt income.

##### Recoupment of Loss-

Where expenditure on plant, machinery or buildings is recouped by the owner, the investment allowance is correspondingly reduced. No allowance can be claimed under this section if an investment allowance has been claimed and allowed in respect of those same assets pursuant to Section 11 or 12 of this Act (the new Sections 117A or 117B of the principal Act.)

### Section 14 - Spreading Cost of Fertiliser and Lime

Under these provisions, persons conducting a farming or agricultural business in New Zealand may defer claiming a tax deduction for all or part of any expenditure on fertiliser and lime (including expenses of applying it to the land). The whole or any part of the expenditure may be allocated in such manner as the taxpayer thinks fit, to any one or more of the four years next succeeding the year in which expenditure is incurred.

Written notice of election to defer the deduction, and the basis on which it is proposed to spread it forward, must be given to the Department by the due date for furnishing the return of income for the year in which the expenditure is incurred (or such extended period as the Commissioner allows) and, once made, the election is irrevocable except in the event of sale or death. In such a case, any expenditure not already allowed may be claimed in full in the year of sale or death, or if desired, it may be apportioned equally over the year incurred and subsequent years up to and including the year of cessation of business, or death.

The section first applies in respect of expenditure incurred in the income year commencing 1 April 1963 (i.e. the year ending 31 March 1964 or equivalent balance date).

### Section 15 - Deduction of 150% of Increased Expenditure on Fertiliser and Lime

This section applies for a trial period of one year only (i.e. the income year ending 31 March 1964 or equivalent balance date). It permits an additional deduction of 50% of the excess of the cost of fertiliser and lime purchased and applied to the land during that year, over the average cost of fertiliser and lime applied to that same land during the five previous consecutive and full years (or lesser number of full years during which the taxpayer has farmed that land). Note that the five year base period relates to full years; therefore if the farm was bought less than 12 months before the commencement of the year ending 31 March 1964 no additional deduction would be allowable.

The additional deduction must be claimed in the year in which the cost is incurred (i.e. the year ended 31 March 1964) and may not be deferred. The deduction for the actual cost may, however, be deferred in terms of Section 14.

'Cost' is defined as being cost of the fertiliser and lime to the taxpayer at the supplier's store, plus transport costs to the taxpayer's premises as well as the costs of applying the fertiliser and lime to the taxpayer's land. Where the work is not done by outside contract, the latter could include vehicle running expenses (excluding depreciation) and labour costs (excluding the farmer's own labour). If, however, such costs are included for the year ending 31 March 1964 equivalent expenses must also be included in arriving at the base period costs.

The 'average' cost refers to the average annual cost of fertiliser or lime applied to the same land during complete years in the base period. If a taxpayer has changed his farm during the preceding five-year period, the average will be calculated on the basis of complete years in which he has owned the new farming property. On the other hand, where a taxpayer has owned two farms over the preceding five complete years, the total cost of fertiliser and lime in respect of both farms must be taken into account in arriving at the 'average cost' as well as the current year's 'cost' - i.e., the overall position counts in such cases, and not the respective positions relating to each farm separately.

##### Calculation Of Additional Allowance

An example showing the calculation of the additional allowance is-

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1959 | Cost | £ 400 |
| 1960 | "   | £ 450 |
| 1961 | "   | £ 400 |
| 1962 | "   | £ 500 |
| 1963 | "   | £ 450 |
|     |     | £2,200 |
| Average |     | £440 |

1964 cost is £600. Excess over average £160. Taxpayer, in addition to the ordinary deduction of £600, would receive an additional deduction of £80 for 1964 representing 50% of the excess of the 1964 figure over the average.

##### Tax Saving

A provision has been introduced to ensure that the maximum tax saving as a result of this additional allowance does not exceed 17/- in the £1 - i.e., the net cost to the taxpayer must be not less than 3/- in the £1.

The limitation will have no practical effect for companies, because the maximum tax rate of 10/- in the £1 ensures that the maximum tax saving that can result will be 15/- in the £1.

However, as the maximum individual tax rate is 13/6 in the £1, the limitation of 17/- in the £1 can apply to individuals.

##### Calculation Of Tax Saving

The legislation provides that where the tax benefit will exceed 17/- in the £1, the deduction allowable under the section is to be reduced so that it does not result in a tax £1 saving in excess of 17/- in the £1. (Similar to the provision in regard to export market development expenditure.) However, to simplify the procedure and to afford the taxpayer a more ready method of checking the actual adjustment so made, it is proposed to adjust the tax saving, where necessary, by way of an additional debit on the notice of assessment.

The method to be used is-

(i) Determine the excess (if any) of cost for the year over the average for the previous five complete years (or lesser number of complete years, where applicable).

(ii) Calculate the tax payable by:

(a) allowing the 'average cost' instead of the actual cost as the ordinary allowable deduction for the year;

(b) allowing the 'average cost' PLUS 150% of the excess as an allowable deduction.

(iii) If the difference in tax represents more than 17/- in the £1 on the excess of actual cost over 'average cost' a debit adjustment will be entered on the assessment notice, which will be accompanied by a statement showing how this adjustment has been calculated. No adjustment will be necessary where taxable income (before allowing the 150% deduction) plus any non-assessable income does not exceed £2,800. 'Taxable income' means the balance of assessable income after deducting personal and other exemptions.

##### Loss For Year Ended 31 March 1964

If the operations for the year ending 31 March 1964 (or equivalent balance date) result in a loss, any tax saving through carrying forward the 150% deduction to a subsequent year, is also restricted to 17/- in the £1.

### Section 16 - Farm Development Expenditure

Under existing legislation certain types of farm development costs of a capital nature (such as clearing the land of scrub and stumps or eradicating pests and weeds) are fully deductible for tax purposes and, if the taxpayer so elects, he may spread the deduction equally over the year in which it is incurred and up to four subsequent years.

Also under existing legislation, further types of farm development costs (such as drainage, water conservation and channelling, landing strips, and fences) are deductible up to a limit of £400 per annum with a right to deduct the excess in following years (up to four) provided the limit of £400 per annum is not exceeded in any of those subsequent years.

The amendment does two things-

Firstly, it removes the £400 limit on the latter classes of expenditure for three years, including the current income year. Thus, those types of expenditure will be deductible in full for the period of three years.

Secondly, it permits the taxpayer to allocate, in such manner as he thinks fit, the whole or any part of both classes of expenditure to any one or more of the four years next succeeding the year in which the expenditure is incurred. This second provision is therefore along similar lines to the spreading forward of expenditure on fertiliser and lime as contained in Section 14 of this Act. (Previously, spreading of the unlimited deduction had to be in equal amounts.)

### Section 17 - Development Expenditure on Farming Land Sold Within Five Years of Acquisition

This is consequential on the amendments contained in Section 16. Under a subsection of the existing section relating to the deduction of farm development costs of a capital nature, provision is made for any profit on selling the land within five years or purchase to be subject to taxation if the selling price exceeds the original cost plus the value of any non-deductible improvements made. That subsection has now been repealed and this amendment now authorises the taxation of any developmental expenditure in such cases irrespective of whether the deduction has been allowed under the previous provisions or the present amendment.

### Section 18 - Export Market Development Expenditure

This section widens the provisions introduced last year whereby certain costs incurred in promotion of exports were made deductible at the rate of 150% of the amounts spent. The amendments are-

(i) The amount of salary earned by a New Zealand employee of the taxpayer (including an employee/director in the case of a company) during the course of an overseas trip to promote exports will qualify for the additional fifty percent deduction. Previously, the position in general was that the taxpayer could claim the extra deduction only in respect of the employee's fares, accommodation and sustenance costs. The amendment, as above, does not extend to directors who are not also employees; nor does it apply to directors' fees, as distinct from salaries, in the case of employee/directors.

(ii) Salaries paid to employee/directors stationed permanently overseas will also qualify for the additional allowance to the extent that they are engaged on export promotion work. Previously, the position in general was that the allowance applied only to salaries of ordinary employees stationed permanently overseas (i.e., as distinct from New Zealand employees merely travelling overseas).

(iii) Payments to directors who are not also employees of the company and payments to associated companies carrying on business in New Zealand may now also qualify if the director or associated company is in business as a consultant or adviser on matters relating to export promotion. Previously, the position in general was that all payments to directors and to associated companies carrying on business in New Zealand were excluded.

(iv) Expenditure directly attributable to research into methods of packaging or presenting goods for export, or the development of special lines of goods not regularly produced or supplied by the taxpayer, also qualifies for the additional allowance.

The section also makes the extra 50% allowance deductible for excess retention tax purposes as from the commencement of the legislation. The amendments described above, however, apply only to such expenditure incurred from 1 April 1963 to 31 March 1965. In this regard it should be noted that the latter amendments apply as from a particular date (i.e. 1 April 1963) and not necessarily from the beginning of the income year, e.g. where the balance date is other than 31 March.

### Section 19 - 150% Deduction for Tourist Promotion Expenditure

This extends the 150 percent deduction for export market development expenditure to the tourist industry with application from the commencement of the legislation. The deduction relates to expenditure on encouraging tourists to New Zealand and has no application to expenditure on other aspects of the tourist trade.

### Section 20 - Increased Exports Incentive Deduction

##### General Description of the provisions-

This section is also concerned with the development of exports. Broadly stated, it gives a tax concession in respect of increased export sales of goods (other than our basic primary products), the concession being that the final exporter of goods receives a deduction of the net profit arising from the increased export sales. The increased export sales are arrived at by comparing export sales for the income year concerned with the average export sales in three earlier years (the base period) and the net income arising from those increased exports is calculated on the basis that each £1 of total sales (domestic and export) produces an equal share of the ultimate net profit for the year. Thus under the formula laid down the proportion of net profit attributable to the increased exports is as follows-

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Increased Export Sales | of  | Net Profit |
| Total Sales | 1   |

The concession relates only to increases in exports of goods; therefore the "increased export sales" figure would not include any increase in services sold overseas. The "total sales" figure would, however, include gross income from the sale of services in New Zealand and overseas in cases where the taxpayer's business is a mixture of selling goods and services. Likewise, the "net profit" figure would include net income from services. The reason for this is that it would be impracticable to arrive at separate net profits for goods and services because of expenditure being intermingled. The "total sales" and "net profit" figures would, however, exclude gross and net income respectively, from the following sources-

*   Interest from lending money (except to the extend that the interest is derived from carrying on a business of money-lending or financing).
*   Rents or dividends.
*   Any other income from investments.
*   Any income that is not liable to or is exempt from New Zealand tax.
*   Proprietary income (in the case of a company).
*   Any amounts included in export sales for some other year.

Although the original Bill as introduced defined the "base period" as being the "period comprising the three income years immediately preceding that income year" this was amended in the Committee stages of the Bill to read "the first three of the four income years immediately preceding that income year".

The three years ended 31 March 1960, 31 March 1961 and 31 March 1962 (or equivalent balance dates) will therefore form the base period for determining the increased export sales for the year ending 31 March 1964. There are, however, special provisions inserted to cover those cases in which a taxpayer purchases an existing business (which has been engaged in exporting goods) either during the above three year base period or in the next succeeding year or in the same year as he claims a deduction under this section.

The scheme is being introduced for an initial period of five years, commencing with the income year ending 31 March 1964 (or equivalent balance date) and as each year of that period expires, the base period will move forward one year. Thus, in determining the increased exports for the year ending 31 March 1965 (or equivalent balance date) the base period will be the three years ended 31 March 1963 (or equivalent balance dates) and so on, progressively over the five year period.

Goods imported into New Zealand and subsequently exported after processing, packing etc. in New Zealand must have at least fifteen percent added to their imported cost before they can qualify as goods to which the concession applies.

There is also provision for the Commissioner to disallow all or part of the concession if he considers artificial arrangements have been made to obtain an unfair advantage under the Section. Another provision enables the taxpayer to apply for a reduction of the average sales for the base period if he considers they were influenced by abnormal trading conditions or other extraordinary circumstances.

A more detailed explanation of the section follows.

##### Export Goods which Qualify for the Deduction

For the deduction to apply, the increase in sales must relate to "export goods". These are goods exported from New Zealand by the taxpayer and of which he was the owner at the time they were sold or disposed of. The definition specifically excludes:

(i) Goods exported by way of gift.

(ii) Goods taken or sent out of New Zealand with the intention that they will later be returned to New Zealand.

(iii) Goods imported into New Zealand and subsequently exported from New Zealand after being processed, packed, graded or sorted in New Zealand, or incorporated with another product in New Zealand, if the selling price is less than fifteen percent greater than their original landed cost price (exclusive of New Zealand customs duty).

(iv) Goods imported into New Zealand and subsequently exported in the same form without any processing, packing, grading or sorting in New Zealand.

(v) Goods exported to the Cook Islands, Nieu or Tokelau Islands.

(vi) Animals, animal products and by-products (including dairy produce, meat, meat produce, wool and their respective by-products) newsprint, and minerals.

The Governor-General is empowered to add or delete from this list by Order-In-Council from time to time.

The section does not apply to Co-operative Dairy Companies, Co-operative Milk Marketing Companies, Co-operative Pig Marketing Companies or any other marketing authority as defined in Section 154A of the Principal Act; nor does it apply to Mining Companies assessed under Section 152 or 153 of the Principal Act.

##### Increased Export Sales

Where a taxpayer's export sales for the year ending 31 March 1964 (or equivalent balance date), or for any of the income years up to 31 March 1968, show an increase over the average for the base period (i.e. the three years previously stated), the section provides for a deduction for income tax purposes (including social security tax) of an amount representing the increased net profit assumed to result from these increased export sales.

##### The Formula

The formula for arriving at the increased net profit is laid down in Subsection (5) and, expressed more precisely than under the general description on page 12, is as follows:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Increased Export Sales (of goods) | of  | Assessable income from sale of goods & services |
| Total Sales (Goods & Services) |

The basis of calculating "Increased Export Sales" has been explained but see also under later headings dealing with the value of export sales and base period adjustments.

"Total Sales" will represent the actual gross sales from the business for the income year, including credit sales and sales of services but excluding any adjustment for the difference between opening and closing stocks. All exempt income, proprietary income and income from investments etc., (as already described) is excluded from the calculation, but gross interest will be included in "Total Sales" to the extent that it is derived from money-lending or financing in the course of the taxpayer's business. In addition, any amounts received during the income year relating to sales returned as income of another income year are to be excluded.

"Assessable income from sales of goods and services" is the net income from those activities and excludes net income from investments etc., (as already described). In other words, the term covers the gross sales of goods and services less all allowable deductions applicable thereto (except the deduction allowable under this Section). The allowable deductions referred to would include special tax deductions such as the extra fifty percent allowance for export market development expenditure and the investment allowances provided for in this Amendment Act but would not include expenses applicable to excluded investment income etc.

##### Calculation of value of export sales

In calculating the value of export sales (both for the base period and the income year for which the concession is allowable) the consideration received for the goods is to be taken as being the actual selling price on a "Free on Board" basis, i.e., exclusive of freight out of New Zealand, insurance and other charges attributable to events, etc., occurring or arising after placing the goods on a ship or aircraft for export. Where the sale of the export goods is part of a transaction involving also the sale of services or the sale of goods which do not qualify for the deduction, an apportionment of the total consideration is authorised.

Where a taxpayer is indemnified under an insurance policy or otherwise for loss of goods after they have been exported from New Zealand he is deemed to have sold them for the amount of the insurance or other recovery. In the case of indemnity for damage to the goods arising after they have been exported from New Zealand, if the taxpayer retained ownership of the goods subsequent to the damage they are deemed to have been sold at a price equal to the insurance recovery plus any actual realised price. If he did not retain ownership of the damaged goods they are deemed to have realised only the amount of the insurance or other recovery.

##### Calculation of Export Sales for Base Period

In general, for the income year ending 31 March 1964 the export sales for the base period will be the average of the total export sales of qualifying goods for the three successive years ended 31 March 1962 calculated on the basis outlined under the preceding heading. However, specific provisions have been made to cover the cases of-

(a) persons acquiring an existing business either during the base period, or during the year immediately succeeding the base period, and

(b) persons acquiring an existing business in the year for which the special deduction under this Section is claimed, and

(c) persons selling a business either in the base period or the year immediately succeeding the base period or the year for which the incentive deduction is claimed.

##### Change of Ownership Provisions

The object of these provisions is to make adjustments to the base period export sales so that the purchaser will not receive an undue advantage and so that the seller will not be penalised.

(a) Persons acquiring existing businesses during base period or in the year immediately succeeding the base period- In calculating the average for the base period, the export sales in that base period by each previous owner of the business are to be added to any export sales made by the purchaser in the base period.

(b) Persons acquiring existing businesses in year for which incentive deduction claimed- Two steps are necessary in this case-

(i) Find average base period export sales of previous owners.

(ii) Apply the following fraction to the answer in (i)- No. of days from date of purchase to end of year No. of days in the year Example "A" sells business to "B" on 31 December 1963. Average export sales by "A" for base period (three years ended 31 March 1962) are £3,000. In the three months period 1 January 1964 to 31 March 1964, export sales of "B" from that business total £1,000. Instead of claiming a deduction of portion of the net profit based on increased export sales of £1,000 for the year, "B's" claim would be limited to the extent to which the £1,000 sales for the three months exceeds three months' proportion of "A's" average for the base period, (i.e., 1/4 of £3,000 = £750). Therefore, the allowable deduction to "B" would be calculated on the basis of increased export sales of £250, i.e., £1,000 (export sales) less £750 (base period export sales).

(c) Persons selling businesses- Subsection 3(c) provides that the vendor's base export sales are to be reduced by an amount corresponding with the amount by which the purchaser's base export sales are increased in accordance with (a) and (b) above - e.g., in the case outlined in (b) above, the export sales of "A" would be reduced by £750 in determining his average for the base period.

##### Persons purchasing Existing Businesses which had no previous Export Sales

Where a person purchases an existing business and there were no export sales in the base period the whole of any export sales in the income year concerned (i.e., the year for which the concession is allowable) would qualify as "increased export sales".

If the business was purchased before the end of the base period (with no previous export sales), but the purchaser commenced exporting before the end of the base period, the export sales for the whole of the base period would be those made by the new owner and they would still be averaged over the three years.

Example Business purchased 31 December 1961.

No previous export sales.

Export sales for period 1 January 1962 - 31 March 1962 total £1,500.

Average for base period (three years ended 31 March 1962) = £1,500 ÷ 3 = £500.

Any export sales in excess of £500 for the year ending 31 March 1964 would be taken into account in determining the deduction allowable under this section.

##### Persons establishing completely new businesses

These persons will be in the same position as those outlined under the previous heading, i.e., base period export sales would be one-third of the total export sales in the base period even though the business was not established until after the commencement of the base period; if it was not established until after the end of the base period or, although established before that date was not exporting, the base period export sales would be "NIL".

##### Calculation of Net Profit Attributable to Increased Export Sales

An example of the application of the formula is as follows-

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | 1960 | 1961 | 1962 | 1964 |
| Total Sales | 75,000 | 70,000 | 80,000 | 90,000 |
| Export sales included therein | 36,000 | 30,000 | 36,000 | 44,000 |
| Net Trading Profit | 15,000 | 14,000 | 18,000 | 27,000 |

Export sales for the base period (1960, 1961 and 1962) = £102,000 average (÷3) = £34,000

Increased Export Sales = £44,000 (1964) less £34,000 (base period average) = £10,000

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Net profit  <br>attributable to  <br>Increased Exports | \=  | 10,000 (Increased Exports) | of  | £27,000 (net Profit 1964) | \=  | £3,000 |
| 90,000 (Total Sales 1964) | 1   |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Tax on income derived during year ending 31 March 1964 would be assessed on | £27,000 |
| Less | £ 3,000 |
| \=  | £24,000 |

##### Insufficient Evidence of Export Sales

If a taxpayer cannot produce satisfactory information in support of his export sales figures for the base period he will not be entitled to a deduction under the section. However, in any case in which the Commissioner is satisfied that the base period export sales are not more than a particular amount he may accept that figure. Therefore, even though a taxpayer cannot put a precise figure on his base period export sales the Commissioner can accept a figure which represents the maximum possible export sales in the base period.

##### Abnormal Trading Conditions in Base Period

Where a taxpayer considers that his export sales during the base period have been inflated through abnormal trading conditions or other extraordinary circumstances, thus placing him under an unfair disadvantage for the purposes of the section, he can make written application to the Commissioner (setting out particulars) to have the matter adjusted in such manner as the Commissioner thinks fit. Any such application should be lodged within the time the taxpayer is required to furnish his return or such extended period as the Commissioner may allow.

##### Special Arrangements to Gain Unfair Advantage

The Commissioner has power under subsection (6) to disallow any excess deduction when he is satisfied that arrangements have been made between the taxpayer and another person (including an associated company) to gain an unfair advantage under the legislation.

##### Excess Retention Tax

Any deduction under this section is also to be allowed for Excess Retention Tax purposes.

##### Application Form

It is proposed to establish a printed form which taxpayers will be asked to complete in support of applications for a concession under the section.

### Section 21 - Co-Operative Pig Marketing Companies

Under this provision, co-operative pig marketing companies will be liable for tax in substantially the same manner as co-operative dairy companies and co-operative milk marketing companies.

As for the two latter types of companies, regulations will be promulgated in amplification of the provisions of this section.

### Section 22 - Repeal of Section 154

Section 154 granted tax exemption to New Zealand companies carrying on business exclusively in non-Commonwealth islands in the Pacific except to the extent that the income was received in New Zealand.

This amendment follows the enactment of a new Section 170 in last year's No. 2 Amendment Act, whereby relief for overseas taxation is given by way of credit for the overseas tax and not by exempting the income from New Zealand tax.

### Section 23 - Fishing Industry Board

This provision is consequential on the establishment of a Fishing Industry Board.

Other marketing Authorities, such as the Dairy Board, the Apple and Pear Board and the Wool Commission are liable to tax on income from interest except bank interest (or interest on loans made to dairy companies from the Dairy Industry Account).

The amendment puts the Fishing Industry Board on the same basis as other marketing authorities with regard to the taxation of interest.

### Section 24 - Co-operative Pig Marketing Companies - Exemption from Excess Retention Tax

This amendment is consequential on Section 21 of the Act.

Co-operative pig marketing companies and any of their subsidiaries whose activities are classified as being of the same nature as those of the parent company, will be exempt from excess retention tax. This follows the treatment accorded co-operative dairy companies and co-operative milk marketing companies.

### Section 25 - Assessment of Non-Resident Traders

This section re-enacts, in amended form, Section 201 of the principal Act. Section 201 imposes a liability for New Zealand tax on overseas principals for whom an agent in New Zealand is instrumental in procuring the purchase from the principal of goods which are in New Zealand or are to be imported because of that purchase. The agent is required to furnish tax returns and pay tax on behalf of the principal.

The amendment enables relief to be given by Order-in-Council where the country in which the overseas principal is resident does not seek to tax a New Zealand principal operating in similar circumstances in that other country.

### Section 26 - Dependants for Tax Code Purposes

The income limit for dependent relatives in respect of whom any allowance may be claimed in the taxpayer's PAYE tax code declaration has been increased from £260 to £275 per annum. This first applies from 1 April 1964.

Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1965
==============================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1965 from PIB vol 23 Jun 1965.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 23, June 1965.

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_](/about/about-our-publications)
.

### Application

**Section 2** - Except where stated this Act applies to tax on income for the year that commenced on 1 April 1965 and in future.

### More power for appeal authorities

**Section 3** - Amends sections 31 and 32 of the principal Act to allow the Board of Review or the Supreme Court to

*   Vary an assessment to conform with its determination.
*   Make assessments or direct the Commissioner to make assessments to conform with its determination.

There have been doubts whether the 4 year time limit for increasing assessments applies to assessments made to conform with a determination of the Board or the Court.

This section makes it clear that the time limit in section 24 of the principal Act is not to apply.

### Special exemption for absentee pensioners

**Section 4** - This section restores the personal exemption for absentees who get pensions from New Zealand. The exemption will be the smaller of:

*   The amount of the pension,  
      
    OR
*   The personal exemption of £468.

Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1967
==============================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1967 from PIB vol 42 Sep/Oct 1967.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 42, September/October 1967

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

### Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1967

This Act sets out the amendments arising from the Minister of Finance's statement of 4 May and from the Budget. It also has other miscellaneous amendments.

#### Application of Act

**Section 2.** Except when otherwise stated, this Act applies to tax on income for the year that began on 1 April 1967.

#### Definition of New Zealand

**Section 3** extends the definition of New Zealand for tax purposes to include the continental shelf. It will be important to mining industries, particularly petroleum, which may extend their activities off shore.

The special codes of assessment at present applying to activities in New Zealand have been extended accordingly and any income derived from the continental shelf is deemed to have a source in New Zealand.

#### Abridged Notices of Assessment

**Sections 4 and 5** are connected with the machine preparation of assessment notices.

**Section 5** allows the Commissioner to issue an abridged notice of assessment in certain cases, for example, where the taxpayer makes a self calculation of his tax.

#### Approved Charitable Donations

**Section 6** includes the Commonwealth Foundation in the list of approved organisations to which charitable donations are allowed for tax purposes.

#### Life Insurance Exemption

**Section 7** extends the scope of the special exemption for Life Insurance Premiums to include policies of personal accident or sickness, whether the person insured is the taxpayer or the spouse or a dependent child of the taxpayer.

Policies of Life Insurance which provide additional benefits for accident or sickness are also included.

The amendment applies from the income year which commenced on 1 April 1966.

#### Retirement From Farming

**Section 8** clarifies what constitutes retirement from farming. In future a person who sells his farm will not be considered as having retired if he continues to carry on a farming business or to do farm work to a substantial degree on a farm owned by a member of his immediate family or a family trust or company. This restriction applies for a period of three years after the end of the income year during which the farm is sold.

This will mean that he may still spread any inflated income over past years but not future years.

#### Incentives for the Fishing Industry

**Section 9** gives a right of election to the taxpayer to deduct revenue expenditure arising from a compulsory survey of a fishing boat either in the year incurred or to spread it forward over the four succeeding years.

This will allow him to smooth out income fluctuations and to use all his special exemptions each year.

The section will apply to expenditure incurred on or after 15 October 1965.

**Section 11** provides a further incentive for the fishing industry.

When the expenditure on surveys is of a capital nature it is at present subject to the allowance of special depreciation at 20% of the expenditure and ordinary depreciation at lesser rates.

This section will allow the taxpayer an alternative. He may now claim total depreciation at the rate of 25% in the year of expenditure and the three following years.

The capital cost of the survey may be written off over a period of four income years. This section also applies to expenditure incurred on or after 15 October 1965.

**Section 14** provides that the capital cost of new buildings or extensions to existing buildings which are for the processing or storing of fish or fish products, and which meet hygiene standards for export, will qualify for additional depreciation allowance of 30%. An apportionment will be made in the case of multi-purpose buildings.

In general the allowance will be at the rate of 20% in the year of expenditure and 10% in the following year.

#### Depreciation

**Section 10** brings the wording of section 113 in line with sections 113B and 114A of the Act. The Commissioner may refuse to allow depreciation where he is not satisfied either that proper records have been kept or that sufficient depreciation has been written off.

#### Special Depreciation

**Section 12**

1.  Extends the allowance of special depreciation by a further year to 31 March 1969.
2.  Introduces a new incentive designed to promote the installation of more tourist facilities in existing hotels. Special depreciation at the rate of 20% will be allowed on the cost of installing private bathrooms, shower-boxes and water closet facilities in existing licensed hotels.
3.  Provides that when a taxpayer has embarked on a development plan within his business which involves the acquisition of capital assets, he will, in general, be able to claim the allowance of special depreciation irrespective of whether the legislation is withdrawn before the development plan is completed. The plan to be approved by the Commissioner.

#### Special Depreciation on Meat Export Slaughter Houses and Meat-Packing Houses

**Section 13** extends the expiry date of the 30% additional depreciation allowance allowed on the cost of new buildings and on capital alterations to existing buildings required to meet export hygiene standards to 31 March 1970.

#### Initial Depreciation

**Section 15**

1.  Extends the 20% depreciation allowance for a further year to 31 March 1969.
2.  Provides that buildings specified under a development plan, approved by the Commissioner, will qualify for the allowance irrespective of whether the legislation is withdrawn before the development plan is completed.

#### Investment Allowance — West Coast South Island

**Section 16** extends the West Coast South Island redevelopment allowance to 31 March 1969.

It also makes provision for continuing development plans in the same manner as sections 12 and 15.

#### Farm Development Expenditure

**Section 17.** Certain classes of farm development expenditure previously restricted to a deduction of $500 (400) in an income year nave qualified lot unlimited deduction in years to 31 March 196S. This is extended to 31 March 1969.

It also makes provision for continuing development plans in the same manner as previous sections.

#### Export and Tourist Promotion Incentives

**Section 18** extends the incentive deduction of 150% of the amount of qualifying expenditure for a further year to 31 March 1969.

#### Increased Exports Incentive

**Section 19** extends the special deduction for qualifying increases in export sales for a further year to the income year ending 31 March 1969.

For the 1967/68 income year only, the rate of the incentive deduction is 20% of the increase.

#### Tarawera Valley Forestry Venture

**Section 20** provides certain taxation adjustments which will allow the Tarawera Valley Forestry Venture to get under way.

The tax provisions include -

1.  The selling value of the land transferred to the Forestry Company will be satisfied by the issue of debentures. To the extent that interest on these debentures is capitalised it will be exempt from income
2.  This capitalised interest which would normally be deductible by the Forestry Company, will not be deductible for tax purposes.
3.  The excess over cost of the value of the standing timber at the date of transfer to the Forestry Company will not be assessed at that date. Likewise it will not be allowed as a deduction when the timber is milled.
4.  Exemption will also be provided for stamp duties on the documents concerned.

#### Source of Income

**Section 21** deals with cases where income from money lent is deemed to have a source in New Zealand. The section extends the meaning of "money lent" to include any form of credit given whether on current account or otherwise.

Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1968
==============================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1968 from PIB vol 48 Feb/Mar 1969.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 48, February/March 1969

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)

### Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1968

This Act contains numerous amendments to the main Tax Act, many arising from the recommendations of the 1967 Taxation Review Committee.

#### Application

#### Non–Resident Investment Company Defined

**Section 3** amends the definition of a "non–resident investment company" to mean non–resident –

1.  companies whose only income from New Zealand is from interest and whose only asset in New Zealand is the principal from which the interest is derived, or
2.  companies, more than 50% of whose total New Zealand assets are "development investments" in "development projects."

These expressions are also defined in the section.

#### Defining "Associated Persons"

**Sections 4 and 5** deal with this definition which is relevant in five subsequent sections of this Act.

Three of these later provisions, **sections 7, 13, 40**, deal with New Zealand tax on interest payable to overseas residents. When the two parties are not "associated persons" the tax will now generally be limited to the 15% withholding tax.

One of the other circumstances in which the term "associated persons" is relevant deals with stock options - **section 14**. The other, **section 26**, deals with the application of the proprietary provisions to a limited type of overseas subsidiary.

**Section 4** provides that two COMPANIES will be considered "associated persons" for the purpose of the proprietary provisions in relation to overseas subsidiaries, if they have 25 percent common shareholding.

**Section 5** defines when persons are to be regarded as "associated persons".

Associated persons are

1.  Any two companies which have 50 percent common shareholding.
2.  Any two companies which are controlled by the same persons.
3.  A company and any shareholder (not a company) who holds 25 percent of the paid–up capital of that company.
4.  Any two persons who are relatives.
5.  A partnership and any person who is an associated person of any partner (e.g., a relative).

#### Income From Business Controlled By Non–Residents

**Section 20** of the main Act allows the Commissioner to determine the taxable income when a business controlled by non–residents appears to produce insufficient taxable income.

**Section 6** now provides that the Commissioner is not to apply these provisions if the income in question is already returned for New Zealand tax purposes by another taxpayer.

#### Non–Resident Investment Companies

**Limitation on Tax Payable**

**Section 7** provides for tax concessions in respect of interest and dividends derived by non–resident investment companies (see reference in section 3 above) from "development projects". In future, the tax on interest derived by non–resident investment companies from a development project will be limited to –

1.  the rate of tax payable in the country of residence of the non–resident investment company, or
2.  15% of the gross interest provided the two parties to the loan agreement are not associated persons.

Rebate continued

**Section 8** continues the rebate granted to non–resident investment companies, of the additional 5% tax payable by. non–resident companies.

#### Tax Concessions On Special Development Projects

**Section 9** provides for certain tax concessions in respect of business profits derived by overseas enterprises engaged in New Zealand in processing minerals to the primary metal stage and whose undertakings have been declared "special development projects" for the purposes of this section.

#### Rebate To Avoid Extra Tax On Back Pay

**Section 10** grants a tax rebate when pay for an earlier income year is included as income of a current year and is received as the result of an order of the Court of Arbitration or other wage fixing tribunal.

#### Donations To Sir Walter Nash Vietnam Appeal Allowable As A Special Exemption

**Section 11.** Donations to the appeal will qualify for a special exemption up to the overall limit of $50 for charitable donations.

#### Interest Exemption For Non–Residents

**Section 12** withdraws the $60 interest exemption from non–residents. The change applies from 1 April 1969. See section 40 which, in general, limits the tax on interest to overseas residents to 15% of the gross interest.

#### Income From Certain Overseas Pension Funds Exempt From Taxation

**Section 13** grants exemption from New Zealand tax on interest derived by an overseas pension fund, provided it is exempt from tax in its home country.

#### Stock And Share Options– Tax On Benefits

**Section 14** deals with the taxation of benefits conferred under stock and share option schemes entered into after 18 July 1968.

#### Transfer Of Trading Stock Between Group Companies

**Section 15.** Any profit on the transfer of trading stock from one company to another in the same "group" need not be taken into account until the stock leaves the group. It may be valued for tax purposes at the same value as the first company could value it - see section 27 which defines a "group" of companies.

#### Agreements Void For Income Tax Purposes Only

**Section 16** amends section 108 of the main Act to make it clear that the voiding of agreements and arrangements under the section is for income tax purposes only. Rights as between the parties to the agreements or arrangements are not affected. This amendment applies to agreements or arrangements made or entered into after 11 December, 1968.

#### Deduction Of Expenditure Or Loss

**Existing practice made clear**

**Sections 17, 18 and 19** clarify the existing practice and also provide specific authority for the deduction of expenditure incurred in producing non–assessable income.

The effect of the sections is –

1.  Assessable income is divided into two classes - dividend income and other income. Expenditure incurred in producing either class of income must first be deducted against that class of income. The division is made so that the proper tax rebate is allowed against dividend income.
2.  Any expenditure or loss incurred in producing non–assessable income may be deducted in the calculation of that income only. Similarly the costs of producing assessable income may be allowed only against that assessable income.

**Section 20** provides that expenditure of a private or domestic nature, or incurred to produce exempt income, is not to be allowed as a deduction. There is no change here in the existing practice. The provision was made necessary because of the more liberal provisions for expenditure claims or losses made in the first 1968 Amendment Act - see page 8 of Public Information Bulletin No. 47.

#### Losses On Disposal Of Buildings

It has long been the practice not to allow a deduction for losses on the sale, demolition or destruction of a building unless it was purchased as a speculation or is a "temporary" building. **Section 21** confirms this practice and also defines a "temporary" building.

**Section 22** continues the provision for a deduction of depreciation on buildings based on fair wear and tear. The allowance for expenditure incurred in altering assets, which does not increase the value of the asset, is also maintained.

#### Special Depreciation On Tourist Hotels - New Allowance

**Section 23** provides for a 20% special depreciation allowance on new hotels or extensions to existing hotels to provide tourist accommodation. The construction of the hotel must be a project approved by the Minister of Finance on or after 19 July 1968 and before April 1972. The allowance is spread over four years at the rates of 10%, 5%, 3% and 2%. Application for approval of projects should be made through the Tourist Accommodation Development Committee, c/o Government Tourist Department.

#### Ordinary Depreciation Recovered On Sale Of Buildings Not Assessable

**Section 24** makes it clear that ordinary depreciation recovered on the sale of a building (other than "temporary" buildings) will not be assessed. A recovery of special or initial depreciation will be assessed as in the past.

#### Calls Paid On Shares In Mining Companies - Deduction Allowable

**Section 25** amends section 129C which allows a deduction of one–third of the calls paid on shares in mining companies. The amendment makes it clear that the deduction will be allowed even if the company's mining is unsuccessful, or if the company has not started deriving income.

#### Proprietary Companies - Application Of Provisions To Overseas Subsidiaries

**Section 26** limits the proprietary provisions to certain classes of overseas subsidiaries of New Zealand companies. Generally the provisions will only apply if income which should have accrued to the New Zealand holding company has been diverted to the overseas subsidiary, or the income of the latter arises from payments from the holding company.

#### Grouping Of Companies For Tax Purposes

**Section 27.** The main effect is that the income of two or more companies comprising a "group" are added together to determine the rate of tax which they will pay. Generally "grouping" will arise when two or more companies have common shareholding of 66 2/3% or more.

Group companies which are wholly–owned by the same shareholders are entitled to set off a loss incurred by any one such company against profits earned by the others. In other cases, a company in profit in a "group" of companies, which are not completely owned by the same shareholders, will be able to deduct subvention payments made to make up losses of another company in the group.

#### Overseas Life Insurance Companies - Limitation Of Tax On Interest

**Section 28** has limited application to some life companies which invest in New Zealand, but do not carry on the business of issuing life policies here. The section re–enacts existing provisions under which interest derived from certain debentures issued before 26 August 1966 is taxed at the special rate applying to life insurance companies. The section now also limits the New Zealand tax on this interest to 15% of the gross amount of the interest.

#### Petroleum And Mineral Mining Companies

**Section 29** deems those companies subject to the special basis of assessment to have paid appropriate dividends when funds not required for development are held for a period longer than 6 years. Any amount taxed in this way will not be taxed again when paid out as a dividend.

**Section 30** amends the special basis of assessment for petroleum mining companies by re–defining "irrecoverable" expenditure.

**Section 31.** A holding company of a mineral mining subsidiary may now claim a deduction for amounts written off advances to the subsidiary in the same way as holding companies of petroleum mining or exploration companies.

#### Changes In Taxation For Some Trusts

**Sections 32, 33 and 34** bring in some changes and rewrite the existing provisions for taxation of trusts. The main points are –

(1) Inter vivos trusts created on or after 19 July 1968, with some exceptions, are defined as "specified trusts".

All trusts arising on a will or intestacy and inter vivos trusts which are not "specified" trusts are referred to below as 'other' trusts.

(2) Adult Beneficiaries

Income will be assessed as beneficiary's income in both "specified" trusts and "other" trusts when –

1.  the adult beneficiary, either under the provisions of the trust itself or by virtue of a discretionary act of the trustees is entitled in possession to the receipt of the trust income during the accounting year, or
2.  the income is paid or applied for the benefit of the adult beneficiary either during the accounting year or within six months after.

(3) Infant Beneficiaries

1.  In "other" trusts –
    *   income is assessable as beneficiary's income if it-
        *   is indefeasibly vested during the accounting year by the trust instrument (a vesting by discretionary act of the trustee will not be recognised) or
        *   is paid or applied within the accounting year or six months thereafter.
2.  In "specified" trusts-
    *   Income will be assessed as beneficiary's income only if it is paid or applied within the accounting year or six months thereafter - there is no provision for "vesting" for infant beneficiaries in these trusts.

(4) "Paid or applied" is defined as a bona fide transaction which places the income in question beyond the possession and control of the trustee in his capacity as trustee of the particular trust. There is a proviso as regards infant beneficiaries in specified trusts, that if income which initially meets this test subsequently comes back within the possession or under the control of the trustee or is used for the purpose of any business carried on by him, it will be treated as "trustee's income" and not as beneficiary's income.

(5) All other income not dealt with above will be treated as trustee's income.

(6) For trustee's income in specified trusts, the minimum rate of tax is 35c in the $ and no special exemption is allowed against this income.

#### Maori Authorities With 20 Or Less Beneficiaries

**Section 35** confirms the position when the beneficiaries in a Maori Authority number 20 or less. Tile Authority is assessable as agent of the beneficiaries whether or not the income has been distributed. The beneficiary is also taxed on his share of the income, subject to an appropriate credit for the tax paid by the Authority.

#### Source Of Income Derived By Non–Residents

_Law clarified_

**Sections 36 and 37** restates the law on the taxation of income derived by non–residents to provide that if income such as interest and royalties arises from a business carried on in New Zealand by the payer, the whole of that income has a source in New Zealand.

#### Excess Retention Tax Now Payable Only By Privately Controlled Investment Companies

**Section 38** repeals excess retention tax except for privately controlled investment companies. This applies for the accounting year corresponding with the 1967 income year.

#### Non–Resident Investment Companies

**Section 39** continues the existing provision that interest derived by a non–resident investment company from development investments is not subject to non–resident withholding tax. However, it is liable for New Zealand tax up to the amount of the "home" rate in an end of year assessment. See earlier comment on section 7.

#### Non–Resident Withholding Tax On Interest Now A Final Tax

**Section 40** provides for the 15% non–resident withholding tax on interest to be a final tax unless the borrower and the lender are "associated persons". See definition of this term in section 5.

#### Refunds Of Tax - Period Of Refund Extended

**Section 41** extends the period in which tax refunds may be made from six to eight years. The change generally applies to tax overpaid under any assessment made or altered after 1 April 1962.

#### Tax Deductions To Be Preferential Claim

**Section 42** deals with the preference given to unpaid tax deductions on the bankruptcy or liquidation or receivership of an employer. The section achieves the original intention that unpaid tax deductions rank in preference immediately after certain debts referred to in section 308 of the Companies Act (in the main wages, holiday pay and workers compensation claims). The new provisions apply to unpaid tax deductions made on or after 11 December 1968.

### Tax Rebate For Visiting Experts

**Section 4** grants a special tax concession to visiting experts who provide certain services in New Zealand. The concession is a rebate which limits the average rate of tax to 35 percent of the taxable income from services as a visiting expert.

### Housekeeper Exemption Extended

**Section 5** extends the housekeeper exemption. A working wife can now claim this exemption for payments to a woman or a day nursery, creche, play centre or kindergarten to care for a child or children while she works. The exemption is $240 or the amount paid, whichever is less.

### Building Societies Letting Properties

**Section 6** provides for the taxing of Building Societies on rental income from property.

### Stock And Share Option Schemes

**Section 7** deals with the taxing of benefits under stock and share option schemes. It amends section 88C of the Act to state more clearly that there is no taxable benefit from a stock or share option when on the taxpayer ceasing employment, or on his death, the shares must be transferred back to the employer or to the person from whom they were acquired for an amount not greater than that paid under the option agreement. The amendment is effective from 11 December 1968 — the date of the passing of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1968.

### Calculation Of Profit Or Loss On Sale Of Mining Shares

**Section 8** provides that the one-third deduction for calls paid on mining shares is to be taken into account in calculating any profit or loss on the shares when they are sold by a person who is required under the general tax law to return that profit or loss for tax purposes.

### Sharemilkers And Leasehold Farmers Buying Their Own Farms

**Section 9** allows a sharemilker or a farmer quitting a leasehold farm to spread forward for a period of five years for assessment purposes the excess income arising from the sale of livestock if the stock is sold in order to purchase a farm. This income may be allocated in any way he wishes to the year of sale or to any one or more of the 5 following income years.

### Supplementary Depreciation On New Hotels, Motels, And Farm Buildings

**Section 10** provides an additional ordinary depreciation allowance called "supplementary depreciation".

The allowance is-

*   1 percent on the cost of a new hotel or motel or new extensions
*   6 percent on the cost of new farm buildings and extensions, other than farm residences and employee accommodation.

However, the combined value of the supplementary depreciation plus ordinary depreciation is not to exceed 10 percent of the cost.

The allowance applies to new buildings or new extensions first used on or after 1 April 1969.

### Concessions To Oyster And Mussel Farmers

**Section 11** allows mussel farmers deductions for certain development expenditure similar to that already deductible by rock oyster farmers.

The section also-

*   extends the qualifying period for both oyster and mussel farmers to 1971.
*   allows the optional spread of the expenditure over the year incurred and the following 9 years.

### Donations By Companies For Research Widened

**Section 12** widens the allowance of donations by companies to include not only donations for research but also gifts to approved institutes for education and training purposes which are important in the economy.

*   The previous $1000 restriction on the deduction is removed.
*   Qualifying donations up to 5 percent of the company's assessable income may now be deducted.
*   Any gift over $5000 to any one institute requires the prior approval of the Minister of Finance.

### Pensions Payable By Proprietary Companies To Former Employees

**Section 13** amends certain conditions on the deduction of pensions paid by companies to some former employees or their widows. The conditions now apply only to proprietary companies where the pension is paid to a person who is or was a shareholder or a relative of a shareholder.

A deduction may be allowed where -

*   the former employee was a bona fide full-time employee, and
*   the pension is reasonable.

### Export Market Development And Tourist Promotion Expenses Continued

**Section 14** amends the export market development expenditure provisions in relation to the costs of making investigations and preparing information, designs, estimates and other material for the prospective supply of certain services outside New Zealand. The qualification that such costs had to relate to a specific tender is now removed.

The section also extends the qualifying period for both export market development expenditure and tourist promotion expenditure for a further year until 31 March 1973.

### Increased Exports Incentive Deduction

**Section 15** amends the increased exports incentive provisions.

*   Certain classes of goods which do not normally qualify for the concession can be declared by Order-in-Council to be "export goods" for the purposes of the section. The range of goods for which such an order can be made is now extended to include certain goods previously imported into New Zealand and re-exported notwithstanding that the added value in New Zealand is less than 15 percent of imported cost.
*   "Minerals" are defined for the purposes of the section. It clarifies the situation as regards scrap metals in particular. Exports of metals in scrap form do not qualify but exports of ingots and billets produced from scrap now qualify.
*   A guaranteed deduction scheme is now provided. In any year the deduction per dollar of export sales is to be no less than the exporter would have been entitled to in the previous year, ignoring any guarantee for that year. If the usual 15 percent deduction based on the increase in export sales is greater, however, the exporter gets this greater deduction.
*   Non-resident companies carrying on in New Zealand undertakings declared by Order-in-Council to be "special development projects" do not qualify for the incentive.

### Deduction For Calls On Shares In Mining Holding Companies

**Section 16** provides for a deduction for calls paid on shares in "mining holding companies". The deduction is one-third of the capital subscribed that will be used for mining development. Calls paid which are to be used for other purposes do not qualify.

### Deduction For Calls On Shares In Mining Companies

**Section 17** continues the one-third deduction for calls paid on shares in mining companies. The deduction is not allowable to

*   a mining holding company which pays the calls out of capital received from its own shareholders and for which they have had a deduction under the previous section.
*   Any company which pays calls out of "re-investment profit" arising from a sale of mining shares. The company's tax on a re-investment profit is deferred as long as the profit remains invested for mining purposes. (See section 21 below.)

### Income Equalisation Scheme Now Extends To Forestry Income

**Section 18** allows individuals deriving assessable income from, forestry in New Zealand to make deposits to the Income Equalisation Reserve scheme. The whole of the income from forestry may be deposited, except assessable income to which section 96 of the Tax Act applies (Section 96 relates to the income derived from the sale of timber from trees planted on farms to provide shelter or to prevent erosion or from trees planted under a Forestry Encouragement Agreement. This section already provides a spread of the income over five income years.)

### Grouping Of Companies

**Section 19** amends section 141 of the Tax Act which deals with the assessment of companies included in a group of companies. The amendments provide that -

*   the tests for grouping are to be applied at midnight on 31 March instead of at any time during the income year.
*   temporary changes in shareholding, voting power or entitlement to profits in order to avoid or take advantage of the group assessment procedure are to be ignored.

These amendments apply to tax on income derived during the income year that began on 1 April 1968.

### Assessment Of Mineral Mining Companies

**Section 20** amends section 152 of the Tax Act which provides that the taxable income of companies mining specified minerals is to be determined by reference to the dividends they declare. This amendment extends this special basis of assessment to companies which are engaged in exploring or searching in New Zealand for the minerals specified or in development work relating to such exploration or development even though they have not yet begun to derive income from actual mining.

### Profits Of Companies From Sale Of Mining Shares

**Section 21** contains new provisions for deferring the assessment of profits derived by companies from the sale of mining shares if these profits — described as re-investment profits — are re-invested for mining purposes.

### Assessment Of Petroleum Mining Companies

**Section 22** amends section 153 of the Tax Act in the same way as section 20 deals with mineral mining companies. The special basis of assessment applying to petroleum mining companies is now extended to New Zealand companies engaged in exploring or searching for petroleum in New Zealand or in development work in such exploring or searching even though they have not yet begun to derive income from actual mining operations.

### Companies With Shares In Exploration Companies

**Section 23** reduces the deduction that a holding company may claim for amounts written off loans to a mineral or petroleum mining company where the loan is made by the holding company from -

*   calls received from shareholders for which they have had the one-third deduction.
*   "reinvestment profit" referred to in section 21.

### Definition Of Specified Trust Amended

**Section 24** excludes from the definition of a specified trust a trust which is created to vary-

*   the terms of a will, or
*   the distribution of an estate on intestacy,
*   for the sole purpose of settling out of court an application under the Family Protection Act 1955 or a claim under the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act 1949.

The amendment first applies to tax on income derived in the income year that began on 1 April 1968.

### Excess Retention Tax

**Section 25** redefines a privately controlled investment company for excess retention tax purposes.

### Refunds Of Excess Retention Tax

**Section 26** applies to companies which are no longer subject to excess retention tax but which have paid that tax in an earlier year. The effect of the amendment is that an excess distribution in any of the six years following the year the tax was paid is to be carried back to enable a refund of the excess retention tax to be made. Any insufficient distribution in any intervening year is to be ignored. The section first applies to any distribution of income in the accounting year corresponding with the income year which began on 1 April 1968.

### Social Security Income Tax

**Section 27** provides for several amendments to the wording of various Acts consequent on the abolition of social security income tax.

_**Remember**_

*   These notes give only brief explanations of the amended sections and should be read together with the Act.
*   Copies of the working notes given to our staff will be available on request shortly. These give more details.

Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1972
==============================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1972 from PIB vol 68 Jul 1972.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 68, July 1972

### New PAYE Tax Tables

In a statement following the presentation of the 1972 Budget the Minister of Finance, the Hon RD Muldoon, gave more details about the proposed tax changes and amended tax tables now issued to employers.

Here is a summary of Mr Muldoon's statement.

### Reasons For New Tax Tables

The two provisions in the Budget necessitating the new tax tables are -

*   The abolition after 30 June of tax exemption for dependent children, and
*   The 10% reduction in most rates of PAYE tax deductions from 1 July onwards.

### Only 3 Codes In New Tables

All children and dependent relatives have been eliminated from the tax codes and PAYE tables. The new tables contain only 3 codes -

*   "M" - married with dependent spouse or employing a housekeeper.
*   "S" - single or spouse with independent income.
*   "No Declaration" - no tax code declaration completed.

Mr Muldoon pointed out that the cutting down of the tax deduction tables should be a simplification for all employers.

### Amendment Bill Provides For Change

In most cases no further action is required by employees. The Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill provides for the change of all existing "M" and "S" codes with numbers after them (indicating numbers of dependants) to simple "M" and "S" codes in line with the new tables.

In a small number of cases, however, taxpayers have been issued with special tax codes to take into account special circumstances personal to the taxpayer. Some of these may need reviewing.

### Adjustment In End-Of-Year Assessment

Claims for dependent relatives other than children for whom a family benefit is payable will be adjusted in the end-of-year assessment and most taxpayers may prefer a substantial adjustment in this manner.

However, if any taxpayer wants an immediate benefit in PAYE tax deductions he should get in touch with his local tax office. They will issue an appropriate special tax code.

### Effect On Provisional Taxpayers

Mr Muldoon also made it clear that the Budget proposals could have an effect on all taxpayers deriving farming, business or investment income who were required to pay 1973 provisional tax. The proposals that could affect the provisional tax liability are -

*   The reduction in the annual rates or personal tax on incomes derived during the year ending 31 March next by 7 1/2 percent.
*   The allowance of the whole of the annual reduction from the first instalment payable by 7 September.
*   The reduction in the special exemption for dependent children to $35 a child for the 1973 income year.
*   An increase in the dividend rebate.
*   Tax deductions at time of payment from Universal Superannuation.

The 1972 tax return forms for provisional taxpayers, which make provision for the calculation and payment of 1973 provisional tax, were printed and distributed well in advance of the Budget announcements. As a consequence the method of calculating the total amount of provisional tax shown in the return forms and the amount payable as the first instalment did not cover the changes announced.

### Department Preparing A Special Handout

The Minister said that the Inland Revenue Department was preparing a special handout to advise the new position. This will shortly be available at post offices and tax offices. (A sample is reproduced later in this bulletin).

### Returns Already Furnished

Mr Muldoon said that a number of provisional taxpayers would have already furnished their 1972 returns and calculated their provisional tax for 1973. In some cases they would have paid the first instalment of provisional tax.

These and other taxpayers who have not yet furnished their 1972 returns may prefer to adopt their 1972 liability for terminal tax as their 1973 provisional tax and pay one-third as the first instalment, as provided in the 1972 return form. This will be quite acceptable to the Department.

### What Is Provisional Tax

The Minister pointed out that provisional tax, as the name suggests, was payment on account. The final tax liability for the year would be determined when the 1973 tax return was furnished.

Mr Muldoon said taxpayers could be assured that the Department would adopt a reasonable attitude regarding the calculation of provisional tax. They would not make any minor adjustments to what the taxpayers calculated as their provisional liability.

### PAYE Tax Tables Now Available

New PAYE tax tables to be used from the first complete pay period after 1 July 1972 have been printed and are now available from all tax offices and post offices.

Tables Available

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| IR184A - Weekly | These tax tables also include tables for -  <br>\- Secondary Employment.  <br>\- Extra Emoluments.  <br>\-Casual Agricultural Employees.  <br>(These tables are unchanged). |
| IR184B - Fortnightly |
| IR184E - Threeweekly |
| IR184C - Fourweekly |
| IR184D - Monthly |
| IR184G - Shearers |
| IR184S - Absentees |

Weekly PAYE tax tables have already been issued to employers. Any employer who has not received the new tables or who uses other than weekly tables should get in touch with the tax office.

More About 1973 Provisional Tax
-------------------------------

### You Don't Need To Recalculate

As is said in the Minister's statement, summarised in item 1 of this Bulletin, 1973 provisional tax is really a payment on account and your 1973 tax liability will be finally determined when you furnish a return for that year.

If you prefer to leave the 1973 tax changes to be taken into account when you put in your 1973 tax return, that is all right with us. All you need to do is to work out your 1973 provisional tax as shown in your 1972 tax return and use this amount as your 1973 provisional tax. Pay one-third as your first instalment.

### Handout (IR3P) Now Available

The Minister of Finance in his statement also referred to a handout being prepared by this Department. This is reproduce at the end of this item and copies are now available at tax and post offices. It should be read together with the 1972 IR3 return form. Of course only those who want to take account of the changes need use it.

### Handout Gives Two Options

If you do wish to take into account the 1973 tax changes the handout sets out two ways of working out your 1973 provisional tax.

The first option is the easier. It takes into account the reduced tax rates and also adjusts for the change in the dependent child exemption. The second option makes adjustments for changes in the dividend rebate, the fact that PAYE tax is now deducted from Universal Superannuation and the additional allowance for donations and school fees. However, even if some of these things affect your tax liability you may still use the simpler first option if you wish. Remember provisional tax is only a payment on account and the final tax liability will be determined when your 1973 return is furnished.

### Example of Option 1

Here is an example, using Option 1, of a provisional tax calculation for a married man with 2 children and a taxable balance of income to be taxed of $3,900.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1972 tax payable on $3,900 (Total Z from 1972 return form) | $ 984.78 |
| \*Add adjustment for child exemption (2 X $28)-See table on handout (IR3P) | $ 56.00 |
| Total tax | $1,040.78 |
| Less 10% adjustment for tax rebate | $ 104.07 |
| Total provisional tax payable | $ 936.71 |

\*Not required if the taxpayer has income from salary or wages and has claimed for his children in his 1972 tax code.

Only one-quarter of the total tax need be paid for the first instalment.

### Why One Quarter

Normally one-third of the provisional tax is payable as the first instalment. However, this year one of the tax changes is a 7 1/2% reduction from basic tax rates and the full year's reduction may be taken from the first instalment of provisional tax. The tax tables supplied with the 1972 IR3 tax return include a temporary surcharge of 3 1/3 %. Taking one-quarter of the provisional tax at these old rates gives exactly the same result as taking one third of the provisional tax at basic rates and then deducting the full 7 1/2 % rebate for the year.

### How We Will Assess 1973 Provisional Tax

Whatever calculation method you choose we will follow it when assessing the provisional tax for the year. If you just pay an amount of provisional tax and don't show how you worked it out we will assume you are not taking the tax changes into account and will use your 1972 tax as your 1973 provisional tax. However, if this is not so please get in touch with us.

### Trustees Can Use Same Basis

If you are a trustee paying provisional tax on behalf of beneficiaries in an estate or trust you also have the option of using the old rates of tax or of working out the tax on the new basis. You may need to work out the tax separately for each beneficiary and, if you use the new basis, attach a provisional tax calculation (Form IR3P) for each beneficiary to the IR5A return form.

### Estimated Income

If you are estimating your 1973 provisional income you can either use the 1972 return form and work out your tax at the old rates or you can use the second option on the handout and work out your tax on the new basis. The notes on the handout tell you how.

### First Instalment When Returns Delayed

If you have an extension of time and will not have your return in by 7 September 1972 you need to pay one-third of the provisional tax you paid for 1972 without taking into account the tax changes. However, if you consider your 1973 income will be less than 1972 you may estimate your income and, if you wish, take into account the 1973 tax changes.

### How To Provide For Additional Deductions

The handout tells you how to take into account the new rates and exemptions in working out your provisional tax. It does not cover the further deductions to be allowed for tax purposes, such as payroll tax or the increased and extended investment allowance. You may estimate your provisional income for 1973 if you consider that taking into account these further allowances and all other factors your 1973 income will be less than 1972.

### Short Cuts For Accountants

Accountants and agents wanting to take the tax changes into account need not use the handout (IR3P) unless they wish. However, it is essential that the amount worked out as the full 1973 provisional tax is entered on the return form. They can also either work out the tax for the first instalment taking the changes into account or pay that instalment on the basis of last year's tax and then adjust the provisional tax liability on the second instalment.

We will be sending accountants a tax table based on the new rates, that is, a reduction of 7 1/2% from the basic rate, to help in working out 1973 provisional tax and later 1973 terminal tax.

The new table can be used together with the 1972 tax tables from the return form instead of using the options in the handout. They give an easy way to work out each instalment of 1973 provisional tax and obtain the benefit of the whole of the reduced tax rate in the first instalment.

Here is how we suggest you use the two tables -

*   First adjust the income to be taxed to take into account the tax changes. For example, add $100 for each child for whom a family benefit is payable - not needed when salary and wages derived.
*   Then read the tax on the adjusted income to be taxed using the 1972 tax table.
*   Take one-quarter of this tax - this is the first instalment payable by 7 September 1972.
*   Next read the tax on the same income using the new 1973 tax table and take away the amount of the first instalment - this is the second instalment payable by 7 March 1973.

\[CCH note: Form not reproduced\]

### Provisional Tax Too High Because Of Source Deduction Payments

Generally, your 1972 terminal tax is used as the basis of your 1973 provisional tax. However, the 1972 terminal tax and therefore the 1973 provisional tax may have been increased because PAYE tax deductions did not fully account for tax on salary or wages or other remuneration in the 1972 year. This could happen, for example, when back pay or secondary income was derived. If you consider your 1973 provisional tax is too high because of this you may reduce it to the amount correctly payable. To find this amount -

*   Work out the gross tax you would have paid if your only income for 1972 had been the income from which PAYE tax deductions were made.
*   In doing this, use the total of your special exemptions as entered on page 2 of your 1972 return form to arrive at your taxable balance of assessable income.
*   Use the 1972 tax tables in the 1972 return form to work out the gross tax payable on this balance.
*   Take this amount away from the gross tax payable on your total income.
*   The balance will be the amount of provisional tax payable.

Here is an example

**Facts**

*   Married man - no children
*   Salary $8,500 - PAYE tax deducted $2,724.80
*   Income liable for provisional tax $200.
*   Provisional tax liability using normal calculation $201.62.

Here is how the provisional tax liability is worked out by the alternative method.

**Tax Calculation on Total Income**

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Salary | $8,500 |
| Provisional | 200 |
|     | $8,700 |
| Less special exemptions | 550 |
|     | $8,150 | Tax $2,926.42 |
| **Tax Calculation on Salary only** |     |
| Salary | $8,500 |
| Less special exemptions | 550 |
|     | $7,950 | Tax $2,827.67 |
| Provisional Tax payable | $98.75 |

Remember, even if you work out your provisional tax in this way you can still use the new tax rates and other optional adjustments provided for on the IR3P handout.

### New Income Tax Rates For Companies - Basis Of Calculation

New company tax tables cannot be made available until the necessary legislation is passed.

However, companies wishing to make provision for tax in their accounts may use the new rates for this purpose. The rates for resident companies are -

1.  On that amount of income which does not exceed $6,250 - 20 cents in the dollar increased by .002 cents in the dollar for each dollar of income.
2.  For each dollar in excess of $6,250 - 45 cents in the dollar.

### Paying Provisional Tax

"Provisional"companies may also use the new rates when paying 1973 provisional tax if they so desire. If it is wished to also take advantage of the 1973 tax provisions affecting companies, for instance, the deduction of payroll tax, the company's income should be estimated. Remember that when estimating the company's income all factors which might affect the income should be taken into account, not only the Budget changes.

### Farm Income Stabilisation Scheme

On 23 March, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Hon. CJ Moyle, announced final details of the Government's plan to extend the voluntary farm income stabilisation scheme to the 1973-74 farming year. The relevant portion of the Minister's press statement is set out overleaf.

### Main Features Of Scheme

The main features of this year's scheme as announced by the Minister are -

*   There will be no formal target figure for the total amount of deposits to be lodged.
*   Individual farmers may again make deposits of unlimited amounts.
*   Farmers who made deposits under last year's scheme are asked, depending upon individual circumstances, to leave those deposits in the scheme for at least a further 12 months. Additional deposits may also be made into the scheme.

### Advantages Of Making Deposits

The scheme allows farmers to even out their incomes in times of fluctuating earnings. Deposits can be made tax free in good income years and uplifted in less successful years. In this way a lower rate of tax may be payable in the year the deposit is uplifted. Worthwhile tax savings may also be achieved if the scheme is used in association with a planned programme of farm development and other farm work.

In the short term a deposit generally has a double advantage for tax purposes in that it will reduce the terminal tax for the year in respect of which the deposit is made and also usually reduce the provisional tax for the following year.

Farmers should consider these advantages in planning for the future.

Here are some further facts about this year's scheme.

### Retired Farmers

As was the case with last year's scheme, provision will be made to allow deposits to be accepted from farmers who retire during the 1973-74 year or within the period allowed for making deposits in respect of that year. Farmers who make a 1974 deposit prior to retirement should advise the Department if they do not wish to have the deposit automatically refunded on retirement.

### Death Of A Farmer

When a farmer dies there will also be provision to allow the trustees of his estate to make deposits for the 1973-74 year in respect of income derived to the date of death. They can also ask the Department not to make an automatic refund of 1973-74 deposits already made by the farmer before his death. Trustees may also elect to retain prior years' deposits in the scheme and carry them forward to later years.

### Refunds Already Made

Deposits will be accepted for 1973-74 even though a refund of an earlier year's deposit may have already been received by the farmer in respect of the 1974 year.

### Year Of Deduction

Deposits made for 1973-74 will be allowed as a deduction from taxable income for the farmer's 1974 accounting year.

### Period Of Deposit

Deposits must generally remain in the scheme for a minimum period of 12 months but deposits can be uplifted anytime after this period.

The maximum period of deposit is 5 years. Early withdrawals within the 12 months minimum deposit period will be allowed in cases of hardship or where funds are required for urgent development work.

### Tax Position In Year Of Refund

Refunds are assessable income in the year the application for the refund is made. However, a farmer can usually ask to have the refund treated as income of the previous year. There is a guarantee incorporated in the scheme which limits the tax payable in the year of refund to the amount of tax saving in the year of deposit.

### When To Make 1974 Deposits

Deposits can be made anytime during a farmer's 1974 accounting year or within the earlier of -

*   Six months after the end of the 1974 accounting year, or
*   One month after the due date for filing 1974 returns.
*   Deposits will also be accepted within any extended time period allowed for putting in 1974 returns.

### How To Make Deposits

Pay your deposit into the local tax office. Cheques and Money Orders should be "crossed" and made payable to "Inland Revenue Department". Attach a note stating that the payment is an Income Equalisation Reserve deposit for 1973-74.

Our local tax offices will be glad to answer any questions about the scheme and you may also find it useful to discuss the matter with your own financial advisers.

### The Minister's Press Statement

The Minister of Agriculture & Fisheries, Mr Moyle, confirmed that last year's voluntary farm income stabilisation scheme would be extended to the current 1973/74 farming year.

Mr Moyle said that in view of the outstanding success of last year's scheme no formal target would be set this year, but there would be no limit on the amount that an individual farmer could deposit.

(Last year farmers deposited more than $94 million against the announced target of $85 million).

"I hope that as far as possible farmers will leave deposits already lodged for at least a further 12 months. I am confident that many farmers are willing to do this and also to make an additional deposit out of this year's income, although individual circumstances will vary considerably," he said.

Farmers and accountants had realised the considerable benefits that could be made by spreading fluctuating incomes. He urged farmers to make maximum use of the scheme in their own and in the national interest.

By supporting the scheme, pressure on supplies of farm inputs and other items in short supply would be reduced, he said. As well as the stabilising effect that could be achieved, farmers would also be protecting themselves in the future when incomes might well be lower.

The Minister re-emphasised that money later withdrawn from the Scheme for development purposes remained tax deductible.

Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1968
==============================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1968 from PIB vol 48 Mar 1969.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 48, March 1969

### Part C - Salary and wage earners - deduction of expenses

#### New Deductions In Tax Returns

Recent changes in the tax law allow taxpayers some further expenses in working out their taxable income.

In this item we tell you about some of the new expenses salary and wage earners may claim in their tax returns for 1969 and later years.

**The New Legislation**

1.  still allows all the deductions that you could get before.
2.  also allows a deduction of any expenses directly related to your occupation and incurred in gaming or producing your assessable income for any income year - provided, it is not of a capital, private or domestic nature.

**Allowance Paid by Employer**

First of all it is important to tell you about the position when your employer pays you an allowance to cover any of the expenses we refer to in this item.

If the allowance is reasonable, that is, it is intended to do no more or less than cover your expenses over a period, leave both the allowance and your expenses out of your return.

We usually accept that an allowance under an award is "reasonable"

If the allowance paid by your employer is not enough to cover your expenses, you will need to show both the allowance and the expenses in your return if you wish to claim a deduction of the difference.

#### How To Claim

1.  Claim the deduction in your tax return.
2.  Give full details - if necessary send in a note with your return. This may save queries later.
3.  Send or take your return to the nearest tax office.

#### What You May Claim

A guide to the expenses you may claim is given here under the headings

1.  Clothing.
2.  Travelling.
3.  Education.
4.  Reference Books, Journals, Periodicals.
5.  Tools of Trade, Technical Instruments and Equipment.
6.  Use of your Home.
7.  Medical Examinations.
8.  Licence Fees.
9.  Trade Union Fees and Professional Association Subscriptions.

#### Remember

If you have expenses which are not covered here, or you are not sure about any point, ask at the nearest tax office. The staff will be glad to help you.

#### Special And Protective Clothing

You may claim the cost of protective clothing necessary for you to follow your occupation.

This could be -

1.  a uniform required by your employer.
2.  clothing to protect you from injury in doing your job - for example miners' special boots.
3.  clothing to help you do your job or which is generally worn by people in your occupation - for example painter's overalls.

**Cost of Extra Clothing Allowable in Some Cases**

In some cases the cost of extra everyday clothing, over and above "normal" requirements is also allowable if it is needed because of conditions peculiar to your employment. Television personalities, public entertainers and models' are some examples of persons who may have extra expense for this reason.

#### Laundering and Dry Cleaning

The cost of laundering or dry cleaning the types of clothing mentioned, over and above any allowance from your employer, may be claimed as a deduction.

#### Travelling

You may claim the cost of travelling from one job to another. as long as you go directly from the one job to the other job. The cost of travelling from your home to your work and back is still not allowable.

A limited range of travelling expenses could also be allowable provided they are a condition of your employment, or would not have arisen but for your employment. For example you could claim car expenses over and above any untaxed allowance received from your employer if you have to make business calls on your way to and from work; or again, if you have to attend a technical seminar or conference directed to keeping up with modern developments or trends in your job.

If you think you may be able to claim travelling expenses. talk your case over with the staff at the tax office. Remember they are interested to see that you make the most of your rights as a taxpayer.

#### Education

If you are an employee in an occupation which requires some financial outlay to help you keep up with modern developments or to maintain your knowledge or skill in your job you may now claim some educational expenses, such as the cost of short refresher courses -travelling expenses may be allowable too. Some examples of courses which could qualify are -

1.  Biochemist attending school on modern developments in chemistry techniques.
2.  Business manager attending short courses run by the New Zealand Institute of Management.
3.  Television technician attending lectures on new developments in TV receiver maintenance.

#### Teachers Training Aids

Any costs borne by teachers themselves in providing training aids to help them in their job may now be claimed as a deduction in their tax returns.

#### Reference Books, Journals, Periodicals

The cost of journals, periodicals and information services used for reference purposes and to keep up with developments in your work may be claimed as a deduction. The cost of replacing standard works and reference books is similarly allowable and we would also allow the cost of other new books costing $4 or less for any one book. Once again the tax office will be happy to look at your particular problem and tell you whether you can claim a deduction.

#### Tools Of Trade, Technical Instruments And Equipment

We would allow the cost of -

1.  individual items or a group of items costing in the aggregate less than $20. Make your claim in the year the purchase is made.
2.  replacing items which initially cost more than $20.

To qualify as a deduction the cost must relate to tools, instruments and equipment necessary in carrying out your duties.

#### Use Of Your Home

If you have set aside part of your home wholly for your work and are using it to help produce your income you can claim the expenses involved. The expenses may be split in the proportion which the rooms used bear to the whole area of your home. Give full details when you send in your tax return.

#### Medical Examinations

If your employer requires you to have a periodical medical examination and does not pay the cost, you may claim a deduction. The people mainly concerned will be aircraft pilots, but others could qualify.

#### Licence Fees

If you have to have a licence to engage in your occupation you can claim the cost as a deduction. Once again aircraft pilots are the ones mainly concerned here, but others could also qualify.

#### Trade Union Fees Professional Association Subscriptions

There has been no change in this allowance.

You can still claim for subscriptions, fees or levies paid to trade or professional unions or associations. As before the maximum claim under this heading is $20.

#### REMEMBER

1.  If you do not get an allowance from your employer for out of pocket expenses directly related to your occupation, you may claim a deduction in your return. Please give full details of the payments you have made.
2.  If you get an allowance from your employer, do not show either the allowance or the expenses in your return.
3.  If your expenses are greater than the allowance you receive show both the allowance and the expenses and give full details of the payments you have made.
4.  Ask at the tax office if you are not sure. This will save queries later.

### Income Tax - Individuals

The rates to apply to income derived in the 1972/73 income year are those set out in Part D of the First Schedule to the principal Act. A general rebate of 7 1/2 percent of the tax calculated according to that basic scale is to be allowed.

### Income Tax - Companies

The rates to apply to income derived in the 1972/73 income year are those set out in Part-B (resident companies) and Part C (non-resident companies) of the First Schedule to the principal Act. Note that new Parts B and C are substituted by section 38 of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1972 - see notes in this bulletin on section 38 of that Act.

### Land Tax - All Taxpayers

The basic rates of land tax for all classes of taxpayers are the same as those in force for last year. These are -

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| On so much of the unimproved value on which land tax is payable as - |     |     | Rate of tax for every $1 |
| Does not exceed | $20,000 | ... ... ... | 5/12 c |
| Exceeds | $20,000 | but does not exceed $30,000 | 5/6 c |
| Exceeds | $30,000 | but does not exceed $40,000 | 1 1/4c |
| Exceeds | $40,000 | ... ... ... | 1 2/3c |

A rebate of 50% is allowed on tax assessed at these rates.

### Excess Retention Tax

The rate of excess retention tax remains the same at 35c in the $ on the amount of the insufficient distribution.

### Bonus Issue Tax

The rate of bonus issue tax remains the same at 17.5c in the $ on the amount of the bonus issue.

Note that under section 34 of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1972 - explained earlier in this bulletin - the rate so fixed will also apply to bonus issues made on or after 1 April 1973 and before the passing of the Annual Act for 1973.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 69, September 1972

#### Application of the Act

**Section 2** provides that, except where otherwise stated, the amendments in the Act will apply to the 1972/73 income year.

### Dividend Rebate

**Section 3** extends the scope of the dividend rebate. It will now be 10 percent of the dividends included in the taxable income where the taxable income is $4,000 or less. Above $4,000 of taxable income the rebate is the smaller of-

*   10 percent of the dividends included in the taxable income, or
*   $400 reduced by 10c for every $1 by which the taxable income exceeds $4,000. Thus if the taxable income is $8,000 or more there will be no dividend rebate.

### Universal Superannuation Rebate

**Section 4** amends the rebate from tax on the Universal Superannuation benefit for the 1971/72 year and the part of the 1972/73 year (up to the end of June 1972) for which the rebate continues to be allowable. It is fixed at $5 for each pay period for which the Superannuation benefit was received. Thus a person receiving the benefit for the whole of the 1971/72 year is entitled to a maximum rebate of $65. In the 1972/73 year the maximum rebate will be $20.

Coinciding with the increase in the Universal Superannuation benefit no rebate will be allowable in respect of the benefit received for any period after 5 July 1972.

In future a PAYE withholding tax will be deducted at the time of payment of Universal Superannuation and this will be allowed as a credit when annual tax is assessed.

### Non-Resident Pensioners' Rebate

**Section 5** makes an adjustment to an existing rebate given to overseas residents who receive certain pensions and superannuation payments from New Zealand. It is consequential on the general 7 1/2 percent rebate from personal income tax given for 1973.

### Child Exemption

**Section 6** reduces the child exemption to $35 (previously $135 or $140) for 1973 and eliminates it completely for subsequent years.

### Dependent Relative Exemption

**Section 7** extends the dependent relative exemption so that it will apply to a child for whom a Family Benefit is not payable.

### Donations and School Fees

**Section 8** increases to $200 (previously $100) the overall limit for qualifying charitable donations and school fees.

### Life Insurance Exemption

**Section 9** amends the life insurance exemption provisions consequent upon the elimination of the child exemption. It preserves the existing situation in which a taxpayer may claim premiums on policies on the life of a child who is dependent on the taxpayer.

### Exempt Income

**Section 10** exempts income derived by certain classes of taxpayers as follows

*   Primary producer boards and marketing boards.
*   Income derived before the date of distribution of an estate and applicable charitable bequest.
*   The New Zealand Racing Authority.
*   The Totalisator Agency Board.
*   Racing and trotting clubs.
*   Non-profit organisations up to $500 of assessable income provided the rules prohibit distribution of income to members.
*   Interest derived by New Zealand residents from United Kingdom post-war credits or in cases where the interest relates to a period when the taxpayer was not resident in New Zealand and the interest is exempt from tax in the country of origin.

**Section 11** - See **section 17** below

### Deduction for Certain Interest and for Payroll Tax

**Section 12** amends **section 112**of the principal Act to-

*   Allow a company to claim a deduction for interest on money borrowed to buy shares in another company when the two companies are assessed in the same "group" for tax purposes.
*   Qualify the general prohibition against the deduction of payroll tax for income tax purposes.

**Section 18** later in the Act allows a deduction of payroll tax on wages which are themselves deductible.

**Deduction of Expenditure to Prevent or Combat Pollution**

**Sections 13 and 16** introduce new provisions for the deduction by business taxpayers of certain expenditure on land not otherwise deductable to prevent or combat pollution of the environment. Section 13 relates to non-farming taxpayers. Expenditure incurred on the land in constructing earthworks, ponds, settling tanks or similar improvements for the purpose of treating industrial waste is deductible in equal instalments over 5 years with a minimum annual deduction of $1,000, or the amount remaining available for deduction if this is less than $1,000.

Farming taxpayers are entitled under section 16 to class similar expenditure incurred by them as development expenditure.

### Special Investment Allowance

**Section 14** amends the existing section 117A dealing with the investment allowance on new manufacturing plant or machinery.

It gives effect to the Budget proposals-

*   To extend the scope of the allowance to all new plant or machinery which qualifies for the special depreciation allowance.
*   To increase the rate of the allowance from 10 percent to 20 percent in respect of qualifying plant or machinery acquired, installed or erected on or after 23 June 1972.
*   To give a further 10 percent allowance in respect of plant or machinery which is used in a redevelopment project in the West Coast region of the South Island.

Important points are-

The allowance does not apply to-

*   second-hand plant or machinery,
*   cars other than taxis or hire cars,
*   hand tools or loose tools,
*   units of plant or machinery costing less than $100,
*   plant or machinery acquired, installed or erected on or after 23 June 1972 but to which the taxpayer was committed on or before that date either under a firm contract or pursuant to a plan embracing plant or machinery.

### Compensation for Failure to Comply With Lease Covenants to Repair or Maintain

**Sections 11 and 17** introduce new provisions governing the deduction and assessment of compensation payments for failure to comply with covenants in a lease of land to repair or maintain the land or improvements on it.

**Section 11** inserts a new section 88E in the tax Act. It provides that any compensation received by an owner of land (including a lessor in the case of a sub-lease) is to be assessable in the year of receipt, with provision to spread forward as the taxpayer elects, up to four succeeding income years.

There are special provisions covering subsequent sales and cases in which the property ceases to be used in production of assessable income before the four years have elapsed.

**Section 17** allows the lessee to claim a deduction for the compensation provided it is in respect of expenditure which itself would have been deductible. The deduction may be claimed in the year of payment or in that year and in any one or more of the three preceding years.

### Deduction for Payroll Tax

**Section 18** inserts a new section, section 122A, in the tax Act providing for the deduction for income tax purposes, of payroll tax. The main features are-

*   It applies to overseas payroll tax as well as New Zealand payroll tax.
*   For the payroll tax to be deductible, the wages in respect of which the payroll tax is paid must be deductible for New Zealand tax purposes.
*   The deduction first applies to payroll tax on chargeable wages which are paid or payable on or after 1 March 1972 ie the first deductible payroll tax will normally be that paid in April 1972 in respect of March wages.
*   The payroll tax is deductible on the basis it is "incurred" in the month that it is payable and not the month in which the chargeable wages were paid.

### Gifts by Companies for Education or Research

**Section 19** clarifies the basis on which the 5 percent of assessable income limitation on gifts by companies for education or research is to be calculated. The limitation is calculated on the assessable income of the company before any deduction is made either under that section or under the new section 126B (see section 20 below).

### Charitable Gifts by Public Companies

**Section 20** inserts a new section, section 126B, in the principal Act providing for a deduction in respect of gifts of money by "public companies" to any of those societies, associations, organisations, trusts or funds to which section 84B of the Act applies. Briefly, these are-

*   Societies etc in New Zealand carried on for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand, and
*   The following specifically named societies-
    *   CORSO.
    *   The Red Cross.
    *   Lepers Trust Board and Mission to Lepers.
    *   Volunteer Service Abroad (VSA).
    *   Commonwealth Foundation.
    *   Sir Walter Nash Vietnam Appeal.
    *   Food Bank of New Zealand.

The deduction is limited to $1,000 for gifts to any one donee in any year and there is an aggregate limitation for all gifts of the greater of-

*   $1,000, or
*   5 percent of the company's assessable income before taking into account any donations under section 126B itself or under section 126A (education or research).

For the purposes of the section, a public company generally means any corporate body which is not a private company under the Companies Act 1955. It specifically includes a subsidiary of a public company and any public or local authority.

### Increased Export Sales Incentive Deduction

**Section 21** provides for the two matters announced in the Budget-

*   increasing the general incentive deduction from 15 percent to 20 percent of the increased export sales,
*   changing the base period for the calculation of the increased export sales from the first 3 of the 5 preceding years to the first 3 of the 6 preceding years.

These changes apply first for the income year 1972/73. The base in relation to export sales made in 1972/73 will therefore be the same base as applied for 1971/72.

### Trade Union and Professional Association Subscriptions

**Section 22** removes the $20 limitation on the deduction under section 129CC of the principal Act for fees and subscriptions which are paid to trade union or to professional associations and which are directly related to the employment of the taxpayer. There is now no limit on the deduction under this heading.

### Deduction of Costs and Expenses Relating to Tax Litigation

**Section 23** inserts a new section, section 129CG, in the principal Act providing for the deduction of costs incurred by a taxpayer in relation to the determination of his liability to tax including costs incurred in pursuing an objection. This can include legal fees, Court costs, witnesses' fees and accounting cost

This also includes a contribution made by one taxpayer towards another taxpayer's costs (for example a test case) provided the point involved affects both and each has objected to his assessments.

Any reimbursement of costs must be taken into account as assessable income when received. This includes costs awarded by the Court.

The deduction does NOT extend to costs relating to any matter or assessment arising from a fraudulent or wilfully misleading return, or to any offence under the Inland Revenue Acts, for example a prosecution, or to any penal tax assessment or to any objection or appeal of an inconsequential or frivolous nature.

### Deduction of Interest at a Floating Rate on Debentures

**Section 24** amends the general prohibition in section 142 of the principal Act against the deduction by companies of debenture interest at a floating rate.

This interest may now be claimed if the Commissioner is satisfied that under the terms of the debenture the race of interest payable is determined by a fixed relationship to banking races or general commercial rates.

### Tax Rate Applying to Life Insurance Companies

**Section 25** amends the preferential tax race applying to life insurance companies.

As from the 1971/72 income year the tax payable by a life insurance company in respect of its taxable income from life insurance business is to be 40 percent of the tax calculated at ordinary company rates.

### Mining

**Sections 26-32** amend the existing legislation and make a number of new provisions affecting taxpayers engaged in searching for or mining petroleum or any of the "specified" minerals. The main points are-

**Sections 26 and 27** concern New Zealand mining companies (as defined). The amendments largely clarify the existing provisions as, for instance, the acquisition or disposal of an interest in a mining asset is to be treated in the same way as the acquisition or sale of the whole asset.

**Section 28** clarifies the situation when a mining subsidiary repays or is deemed to be able to repay advances which were made by, and previously claimed as a deduction by a holding company.

**Sections 29 and 30** extend with some modifications last year's legislation affecting New Zealand mining companies (as defined) to-

*   Resident mining operators who will-
    *   be able to claim as and when incurred all costs of exploration and development associated with petroleum or minerals,
    *   not (unlike mining companies) be able to claim 2 years provision in advance,
    *   be able to set off a mining loss against non-mining assessable income up to 50 percent of the latter,
    *   be assessed at full rates on any mining income.

*   Non-resident mining operators who will-
    *   be able to deduct all costs of exploration and development as and when incurred - also 2 years provision for such costs,
    *   be assessed at a flat 45c in the $ on any income from a mining venture in New Zealand.

**Section 31** deals with past exploration or development expenditure incurred by resident and non-resident mining operators.

**Section 32** contains a number of consequential mining amendments.

### Interest Derived by Marketing Authorities

**Section 33** repeals section 154A of the principal Act relating to the taxation of interest on loans made out of certain accounts by marketing authorities. The repeal is associated with the exemption of marketing authorities under section 10 of the Amendment Act.

### Bonus Issue Tax

**Sections 34 and 35** both deal with bonus issue tax.

**Section 34** provides that the rate of bonus issue tax applicable to any bonus issue is to be that fixed by the last Annual Tax Act passed immediately prior to the making of the bonus issue.

**Section 35** changes the date of payment of bonus issue tax. Instead of being assessed at the end of the year and paid by the company with its terminal income tax, it will now be self-assessed by the company and be due on the 20th of the month following the month in which the bonus issue is made.

Both these changes apply to bonus issues made on or after 1 April 1973.

### Due Date for Land Tax and Payment Date for Income Tax by Companies

**Section 36** inserts a new **section 204** in the principal Act providing for the-

*   Permanent fixing of the due date for land tax as 7 October each year instead of having to prescribe the due date annually.
*   Payment of income tax by subsisting companies and some other taxpayers in two instalments each year.
*   Fixing of the due dates of those instalments by reference to the taxpayer's balance date. This will advance the payment of tax for some taxpayers.
*   Implementation of the two instalment basis in two stages. The first in 1973/74 has general application and affects tax on income derived in the income year ending on 31 March 1973 (or equivalent balance date). The second in the following year affects companies with "early" balance dates in the tax year.
*   Fixing of the terminal tax due date For PAYE companies by reference to the balance date in line with that above for subsisting companies. Generally, this will take effect in 1974/75 in relation to terminal tax on income derived in the income year ending on 31 March 1974 (or equivalent balance date).

### Taxpayers Who Now Pay by Instalments

With these general outlines in mind the following taxpayers will now pay in two instalments -

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| *   Subsisting companies. | Refer to below under "Subsisting Companies" |
| *   Public Authorities. |
| *   Maori Authorities. |
| *   Trustees of non-exempt superannuation funds. |

What to Pay

*   First Instalment-
    *   One-third of the tax payable in the preceding year. Note this may be reduced if the estimated income tax for the current year will be less than the tax of the previous year.

*   Second Instalment-
    *   Actual tax due for the current year less the amount paid as the first instalment.

The following table sets out the position for the two years 1973/74 and 1974/75.

### Subsisting Companies

Tax on Income Derived in Year Ending 31 March 1973

| Month of Balance Date | 1st Instalment Due Date | 2nd Instalment Due Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| October 1972 -December 1972 incl | 7 August 1973 | 7 February 1974 |
| January 1973 -June 1973 incl | 7 August 1973 | 7 February 1974 |
| July 1973 | 7 September 1973 | 7 February 1974 |
| August 1973 | 7 October 1973 | 7 February 1974 |
| September 1973 | 7 November 1973 | 7 February 1974 |

The only exception to this in the first year (1973/74) will be in a case where a taxpayer changes balance date to a date earlier than 31 March in the income year and furnishes a return for a period of less than 12 months. In this case, the pattern of payments laid down for general application from 1974/75 onwards will apply to that taxpayer for 1973/74. This is-

**Income Year Ending 31 March 1974**

| Month of Balance Date | 1st Instalment Due Date | 2nd Instalment Due Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| October 1973 | 7 March 1973 | 7 September 1974 |
| November 1973 | 7 April 1974 | 7 October 1974 |
| December 1973 | 7 May 1974 | 7 November 1974 |
| January 1974 | 7 June 1974 | 7 December 1974 |
| February 1974 | 7 July 1974 | 7 January 1975 |
| March 1974 | 7 August 1974 | 7 February 1975 |
| April 1974 | 7 August 1974 | 7 February 1975 |
| May 1974 | 7 August 1974 | 7 February 1975 |
| June 1974 | 7 September 1974 | 7 February 1975 |
| July 1974 | 7 October 1974 | 7 February 1975 |
| August 1974 | 7 November 1974 | 7 February 1975 |

Subsequent years follow the same pattern.

### Terminal Tax Due by PAYE Companies

| Income Year Ending 31 March 1973 |     | Income Year Ending 31 March 1974 |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Month of Balance Date | Terminal Tax Date | Month of Balance Date | Terminal Tax Date |
| October 1972 | 7 February 1974 | October 1973 | 7 September 1974 |
| November 1972 | 7 February 1974 | November 1973 | 7 October 1974 |
| December 1972 | 7 February 1974 | December 1973 | 7 November 1974 |
| January 1973 | 7 February 1974 | January 1974 | 7 December 1974 |
| February 1973 | 7 February 1974 | February 1974 | 7 January 1975 |
| March 1973 | 7 February 1974 | March 1974 | 7 February 1975 |
| April 1973 | 7 February 1974 | April 1974 | 7 February 1975 |
| May 1973 | 7 February 1974 | May 1974 | 7 February 1975 |
| June 1973 | 7 February 1974 | June 1974 | 7 February 1975 |
| July 1973 | 7 February 1974 | July 1974 | 7 February 1975 |
| August 1973 | 7 February 1974 | August 1974 | 7 February 1975 |
| September 1973 | 7 February 1974 | September 1974 | 7 February 1975 |

Subsequent years follow the same pattern.

Again, the only exception to the pattern of payments for the first year (1972/73 income year) is that of a PAYE company which changes its balance date to a date earlier than 31 March and furnishes a return for a period less than 12 months. In such a case the pattern of payment laid down for general application for 1974/75 (1973/74 income year) and the future will apply to that company for terminal tax on 1972/73 income.

### Hardship Relief for Divorced and Separated Persons Supporting Children

**Section 37** introduces new hardship relief provisions into the tax Act. They apply to divorced and separated persons who support their children who are not living with them. In these cases the new provisions will enable relief to be given where the taxpayer is no longer entitled to a child or dependent relative exemption and also does not receive the increased family benefit payable since July 1972.

The relief when serious hardship can be shown is in the form of additional exemptions. Up to $135 may be granted for each child, up to 3 children, supported.

### New Company Tax Rates

**Section 38** amends the First Schedule to the principal Act. It changes the basic rates of tax for companies.

*   For resident companies the basic rate is now-
    *   20c in the $ increased by .002c for every $1 of income up to $6,250. On the income over $6,250 the rate is a flat 45c in the $.

*   For non-resident companies the basic rate is-
    *   25 increased by .002c for every $1 of income up to $6,250. On the income over $6,250 the rate is a flat 50c in the $.

Both these new rate scales apply to income derived in the income year ended 31 March 1972 (or equivalent balance date). They are also adopted by the Annual Act 1972 in respect of tax on income derived in the 1972/73 income year.

### Insurance Underwriters

**Section 39** makes no substantive change in the existing law relating to insurance underwriters. For many years they have been liable to tax on a taxable income calculated as 10 percent of gross premiums and the tax rate applicable to that taxable income has been the maximum rate for resident companies which gave an effective tax rate of 5% of the gross premiums. This amendment merely formalises the rate as 50c in the $ on the taxable income.

### Continuation of Tax Incentives

**Section 40** replaces the existing Third Schedule to the principal Act with a new Schedule. This new Schedule contains the extended terminating dates for all the taxation incentives listed. In addition it contains a brief description of each particular connectional deduction instead of just the Act section reference as previously. The Schedule of the new terminating dates is set out at the end of this Bulletin.

### Minor Drafting Amendments

**Section 41** makes two very minor reference corrections.

### Tax Deductions from the Superannuation Benefit

**Section 42** authorises the Social Welfare Department to make payment of the tax deductions now being made from the Universal Superannuation benefit in one sum on the 31 March each year.

### New PAYE Tax Deduction Tables

**Section 43** and the First Schedule to the Amendment (No 2) Act provide for the new weekly PAYE tax deduction tables in respect of salary and wages, secondary employment earnings (now 19c) and shearer's daily earnings over $8.

These new tables and rates take into account the 10 percent reduction from 1 July 1972 (7 1/2 percent for the full year) announced in the Budget and have the same effect as the arrangements brought into force by the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1972.

### Provisional Tax for 1972/73

**Section 44** deals with the calculation and payment of provisional tax for the current year 1972/73. This is necessitated by the changes in special exemptions, rebates and tax races from those applying in the 1971/72 income year which would normally provide the basis for 1972/73 provisional tax. The changes which may be taken into account, in the calculation of 1972/73 provisional tax are-

*   Reduction of the child exemption to $35 for the 1973 year.
*   Withdrawal of this exemption and the dependent relative exemption for tax code purposes.
*   The extended dividend rebate.
*   The reduced rebate in respect of Universal Superannuation.
*   The classifying of the Universal Superannuation as a source deduction payment.
*   The general 7 1/2 percent rebate from income tax which may be deducted wholly from the first instalment.

None of these changes apply to a company.

The Department has produced a new form IR 3P to assist taxpayers in the calculation or recalculation of their 1972/73 provisional tax. It is available at any post office or office of the Department. However, taxpayers if they prefer, may use the basis set out in the 1972 tax return, form IR 3, in calculating their 1973 provisional tax. Whatever is paid by way of provisional tax is of course subject to adjustment when the 1973 return is furnished.

Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1973
======================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1973 from PIB vol 76, Dec 1973.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 76, December 1973

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

#### Part I

### Terminating Date of Taxation Incentives

**Section 3** provides for the extension of certain taxation incentive concessions as announced in the Budget. A schedule giving the new terminating dates is set out in Appendix I to this bulletin. Those marked with an asterisk were not extended by this Act.

### Approval of New Superannuation Funds

**Section 4** provides that new superannuation funds for which approval for tax purposes is sought after 6 September 1973 will require the approval of the Minister or Finance.

Up to now superannuation funds have been approved for taxation purposes by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This change is an interim provision associated with the establishment of the New Zealand Superannuation Scheme and these new schemes will in general require to meet conditions referred to in the White Paper on the New Zealand Superannuation Scheme released on that date. However, inquiries should still be addressed to your local tax office.

### United Kingdom Dividends

**Section 5** makes an amendment to the definition of dividends in the tax Act consequent upon the change in the United Kingdom system of taxing companies and the dividends paid by those companies to their shareholders. On and after 6 April 1973 United Kingdom companies when paying dividends to shareholders will pay tax to the United Kingdom revenue authorities which is available for credit to the shareholders. For New Zealand tax purposes these gross tax credits will be treated as part of the dividend.

Under another provision in **section 35** of this Act the net tax paid in the United Kingdom in respect of the dividend after deducting any refund available from the United Kingdom revenue authorities may be claimed as a credit for New Zealand tax purposes.

### Non-Resident Companies Tax Rebate Repealed

There is a provision in the tax Act which allows a rebate to a non-resident company in respect of:

*   the 15 percent withholding tax on any dividends it has received, and
*   the additional 5 percent tax on other income derived from New Zealand,

when the non-resident company in turn pays dividends to New Zealand residents. No other country gives a similar rebate and it has been repealed.

### Overtime and Shift Work Rebates

**Section 7** provides for the rebates to individuals in respect of overtime and shift work. The overtime rebate is 10 cents for every hour of paid overtime worked. The shift work rebate is 40 cents for every qualifying shift worked.

A separate circular explaining these rebates has already been sent to employers. Copies are available at any Inland Revenue office on request.

### Compensation for Loss of Office

**Section 8** provides that payments of compensation for loss of office are to be given the same general treatment for tax purposes as retiring allowances or redundancy payments. In general when the employee has been employed for 10 years or more only 5 percent of a payment up to the average amount of the last three years' salary plus any excess over this figure is liable to tax.

### Profits from Land Transactions

**Section 9** refers to profits from land transactions including subdivisions. A separate explanatory pamphlet dealing in detail with this topic is available on request from any Inland Revenue office.

### Repeal of Aggregation Provisions

**Section 10** repeals the provisions of the tax Act dealing with the aggregation of the incomes of husband and wife.

### Standard Deduction for Salary and Wage Earners

**Section 11** provides that from 1 April 1974 a standard 2 percent (maximum $50) allowance will be given against "income from employment" in lieu of any actual expenses incurred. Ministers of religion, shearers and wool classers are excluded from this new provision.

### Payroll Tax Repeal - Consequential Income Tax Changes

**Section 12** makes the necessary consequential income tax amendment as result of the repeal with general effect from 1 October 1973, of the payroll tax.

### Meat Export Firms - Cost of Demolition and Loss on all Buildings Demolished because of Hygiene Requirements

**Section 13** provides that when an old building owned by a meat works has to be demolished because of hygiene requirements overseas the cost of demolishing plus the loss on the old building is to be added to the cost of the replacement building for depreciation purposes.

### Government Assistance to Businesses

**Sections 14 to 16 and 19 to 21** make the necessary consequential taxation adjustments when Government grants or suspensory loans are made to business taxpayers.

The general intent of the provisions taken together is -

1.  If the grant is made in respect of expenditure which would otherwise be deductible for tax purposes the deduction will be reduced by the amount of the grant.
2.  If the grant is made for the specific purpose of purchase of assets, the value of the assets for depreciation and investment allowance purposes will be reduced by the grant.
3.  Where expenditure reduced as in (i) above would otherwise qualify for an export market development incentive the claims for those incentives will also be accordingly reduced.
4.  With export suspensory loans, any amounts written off will be treated as assessable income in the year written off and the following two years.
5.  As already noted regional development suspensory loans are treated as grants at the outset. However, if they subsequently have to be repaid the appropriate adjustments for tax purposes are made at that point.

### Gifts to the NZ Medical Education Trust

**Section 17** provides a deduction up to $400 for gifts made by doctors to this Trust.

### Export Market Development Expenditure and Tourist Promotion Expenditure

**Section 18** is a machinery amendment necessary because these two incentive concessions now have different terminating dates.

*   Export Market Development Expenditure - 31 March 1977.
*   Tourist Promotion Expenditure - 31 March 1976.

### Deduction for Increased Export Sales

**Section 22** provides for the Budget proposal to withdraw the increased export incentive for certain goods which are not considered to be sufficiently processed in New Zealand before export to justify the concession.

Except where a firm order as to price and quantity was received and accepted before 15 June 1973 the following cases will no longer qualify for the export incentive:

*   Logs (however, newsprint and sawn timber will continue to qualify).
*   Sales by duty free shops.
*   Fish and frozen fish.
*   Game meats, products and by-products of game.
*   Poultry and products and by-products.
*   Bees including products and by-products.
*   Certain seeds.

The section also provides adjustment to the formula for arriving at the amount of the increased export incentive deduction by reason of certain goods no longer qualifying as export goods.

### Income Equalisation Reserve Scheme

**Sections 23 to 26** deal with the Income Equalisation Reserve Scheme. The amendments apply only to income derived from farming businesses and the main features are:

*   Provision is made for an Order in Council to provide for an unlimited amount to be deposited.
*   An adjustment is made to the guarantee scheme whereby the tax assessed, when a deposit is uplifted, will not be greater than the tax saved when the deposit was originally made. The existing provisions could produce an illogical result now that for the 1973 year deposits may exceed the actual farm income.
*   Deposits for the 1973 year may be made by a farmer who has retired from business in that year or the "specified period" of six months after that year or in respect of a farmer who died during that year or specific period.
*   The few remaining deposits in the Snow Loss Reserve Account are to be transferred on 1 December 1973 to the Farm Income Equalisation Reserve Account.

### Losses Carried Forward

**Section 27**amends the losses carried forward provisions in three specific types of cases:

*   Companies whose shares are traded on the Stock Exchange. Mining companies in specific circumstances.
*   Where a loss previously allowed for income tax purposes is to be allowed for property speculation tax.

### Assessment of Co-operative and Other Mutual Associations

**Section 28** clarifies the existing law under which co-operatives and other mutual associations are taxed without altering the principles of those provisions.

The main points are:

*   A deduction will be allowed for rebates to members provided it does not produce the assessable income below the income derived from non-members.
*   The income of the mutual association can be apportioned on a more factual basis between members and non-members.
*   Provision is made to secure the benefit of tax incentives such as the investment allowance and the increased exports incentive by allowing the incentive deductions in effect to be carried forward to the following year.

### Life Insurance and Reinsurance Companies

**Sections 29 and 30** clarify the conditions to be met before companies can be classified either as life insurance companies or life reinsurance companies to enable them to get the benefit of the special code of assessment.

### Companies Holding Shares in Mining Companies

**Section 31** deals with the situation when assets are transferred from a mining company which has received advances from its holding company. The full value of those assets up to the amount of the advances is to be taken into account in determining whether the mining company has derived sufficient profits with which to repay the advances from its holding company.

### Maori Trustee

**Section 32** provides that from 1 April 1974 the Maori Trustee in his capacity as collecting and distributing agent for rents or royalties is no longer to be classed as a Maori Authority for income tax purposes.

### Accident Compensation Payments

**Section 33** is a machinery provision giving earnings related payments under the Accident Compensation scheme a source in New Zealand.

### Calculation of Tax on Dividends

**Section 34** is a machinery amendment reinstating certain provisions dealing with the calculation of New Zealand tax on dividend income.

### Section 35 - United Kingdom Tax on Dividends

See **section 5** above.

### Hardship Relief

**Section 36** extends the classes of people who may claim special relief on hardship grounds to an unmarried person who has to care for a dependent child or children.

### Metric Conversion

**Section 37** provides for certain references in the tax Act to be converted to metrics.

### Miscellaneous Amendments

**Section 38** makes minor consequential tax changes.

#### Part II

### Switch of Subsisting Companies and Other Taxpayers to PAYE Basis

This Part of the Act brings subsisting companies and the other classes of taxpayers not at present on a PAYE basis of paying income tax on to such a basis. Every company affected has received a circular explaining the switch and extra copies of that circular are available at local Inland Revenue offices.

The main features in Part II are -

*   Subsisting companies and the other taxpayers concerned begin paying PAYE provisional tax in respect of the 1973/74 income year.
*   Two instalments are payable each year. Special dates are fixed for 1973/74. For 1974/75 and future years the instalment dates for all provisional taxpayers are those set out in the schedule in Appendix II to this Bulletin.
*   Income tax for 1972/73 (the last year on the old system) is to be payable in 14 equal instalments over seven years at the same time as provisional tax instalments are payable.
*   A rebate of 7 1/2 percent with a maximum of $262.50 is allowable in any case where the total 1972/73 income tax is paid by 7 March 1974.
*   The previous provision whereby the 10 percent late payment penalty was automatically reduced to 5 percent if tax was paid within three months of the due date is abolished. For 1973/74 and future years all additional tax for late payment is at a flat 10 percent.

#### Part III

### New Personal Income Tax 1974/75

This Part of the Act provides for the new system of personal tax rebates instead of special exemptions and the new income tax rates scale to be adopted for the 1974/75 income year. It also provides for the new PAYE tables to operate from 1 April 1974.

The main features are:

*   The personal special exemption of $275 (allowed as a deduction from income) is to be replaced by a personal rebate of $125 to be allowed as a deduction from tax assessed.
*   The married exemption of $275 is to be replaced by a married rebate of $125.
*   The housekeeper exemption of $275 is to be replaced by a housekeeper rebate of $125.
*   The dependent relative exemption of $135 is to be replaced by a dependent relative rebate of $60.
*   The new income tax rate scale to apply from 1 April 1974 is reproduced as Appendix III to this Bulletin.

Land Tax Amendment Act 1985
===========================

Archived legislative commentary on the Land Tax Amendment Act 1985 from PIB vol 138 Mar 1985.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 138, March 1985

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_](/about/about-our-publications)
.

This Act was assented to on 29 March 1985.

### Section 1. Short Title

This Act has the above title and is to be read together with and deemed part of the Land Tax Act 1976.

### Section 2. Application

Provides that this Act applies with respect to the assessments of land tax in respect of land held at noon on 31 March 1985.

### Section 3. Objections to Assessments

This section amends section 45(1) of the principal Act.

Section 45 has always provided that the provisions of sections 30 to 35 of the Income Tax Act 1976 apply to land tax, i.e., objections to assessments of land tax are subject to the provisions of sections 30-35 of the Income Tax Act and those objections are to be treated in the same manner as an objection to an assessment of income tax is treated.

The amendment made to section 45(1) provides that the new provisions relating to the collection and payment of income tax in dispute, as introduced in sections 7, 8 and 40 of the Income Tax Amendment (No. 2) Act 1985 and contained in sections 34, 34A, and 398 of the Income Tax Act 1976, will also apply to land tax.

Those new provisions are set out fully in PIB 136 Part 2, Appendix A, Part II.

**_Paragraph (a)_**

Paragraph (a) of this section amends paragraph (a) of section 45 and provides that every reference in sections 30 to 34A of the Income Tax Act to income tax or to tax are to be treated as if those references were references to land tax.

**_Paragraph (b)_**

Paragraph (b) of this section amends paragraph (b) of section 45 and provides that every reference in sections 34, 34A and 35 of the Income Tax Act to income are to be treated as if those references were references to land.

### Section 4. Additional tax to be charged if default made in payment of tax

The section repeals and substitutes section 47 of the principal Act.

Section 47 provides for additional tax to be charged on default in payment of land tax.

The section provides that the provisions of section 398 of the Income Tax Act shall with the _exceptions_ of subsections (6) _and_ (7) of section 398 apply to land tax.

The new provisions of section 398 provide for:

*   the inclusion of the new "incremental" additional tax provisions;
*   the inclusion of an "in lieu" additional tax calculated at a daily interest rate in respect of an amount of deferrable tax.

The facility for the automatic 50 percent remission of additional tax where payment of unpaid land tax is made within three months after the due date has been removed.

Full details of the new provisions of section 398 of the Income Tax Act refer to PIB 136 Part 2, Appendix A.

Land Tax Amendment Act 1986
===========================

Archived legislative commentary on the Land Tax Amendment Act 1986 from PIB vol 157 Nov 1986.

### Penalty for failure to furnish returns, etc

Section 2 gives effect to the Government's decision to increase the maximum penalties for offences against the Land Tax Act. The section amends section 58 of the principal Act by increasing the maximum penalties for offences against the principal Act. The new penalties are set out in Appendix III of this Bulletin.

A feature of the new penalties is that the maximum penalties are increased for taxpayers who have been convicted of an offence or offences against the principal Act on a previous occasion. It should be noted that the maximum penalty does not increase with each single offence committed. The increase in penalty occurs only on each occasion on which the taxpayer is convicted of one or more offences against the principal Act.

### Example

1\. Taxpayer fails to furnish land tax returns for the years ending 31 March 1985, 1986 and 1987. He is prosecuted and convicted of these offences on one occasion. As this is the first conviction the maximum penalties are:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1985 | $ 500 |
| 1986 | $2,000 |
| 1987 | $2,000 |

2\. The same taxpayer later fails to furnish land tax returns for the years ending 31 March 1988 and 1989. He is prosecuted and convicted of these offences on one occasion. As this is the taxpayer's second conviction the maximum penalties are:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1988 | $4,000 |
| 1989 | $4,000 |

3\. The same taxpayer later fails to furnish land tax returns for the years ending 31 March 1990 and 1991. He is prosecuted and convicted of these offences on one occasion. As this is the taxpayers third conviction the maximum penalties are:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1990 | $6,000 |
| 1991 | $6,000 |

4\. The maximum penalties for any subsequent conviction in respect of offences for failure to furnish a land tax return will be $6,000.

### Officers and employees of corporate bodies

Section 3 inserts into the principal Act a new section 58A which provides that an officer or employee of a corporate body who is responsible for furnishing information to the Commissioner commits an offence if he or she fails to do so..

The expression "officer" is defined, for the purposes of section 58A, in section 58A(1) as including:

1.  a director, or secretary or other statutory officer of the corporate body;
2.  a receiver or manager of any property of the corporate body;
3.  a liquidator of the corporate body.

Whether or not an officer or employee of a body corporate is responsible for furnishing information on behalf of that body corporate is a question of fact which must be decided on the basis of the facts of each case.

The penalty for this new offence is provided in section 58(2) of the principal Act.

[GST](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-annual-rates-returns-filing-and-remedial-matters-act-2012/gst "GST")

Late payment fees
=================

2012 amendment clarifies the GST treatment of late payment fees and excludes penalty or default interest from the ambit of the supply.

_Sections 5(25) and (26) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985_

### Key features

Prior to this rule change there was some confusion surrounding the GST treatment of certain late payment fees. New sections 5(25) and (26) have been added to clarify that GST generally applies to fees for the late payment of an account in the same way as the underlying supply to which the fee relates.

### Background

Previously there was some confusion over whether a late payment fee was:

*   a taxable supply, subject to GST;
*   default or penalty interest, exempt from GST; or
*   an amount that represented liquidated damages or a penalty that was not a "supply" at all for GST purposes.

Late payment fees being subject to GST is consistent with a broad-based tax. In this respect, it is important to differentiate between late payment fees, which can be seen as an increase in the consideration of the underlying goods and services, and default or penalty interest, which is an exempt financial service.

New section 5(25) makes this distinction clear by specifically excluding penalty or default interest from the ambit of the supply. This means that, to the extent an amount consists of such interest, that portion will continue to be exempt.

What is a late payment fee and what is interest will always be determined on a case-by-case basis. For example, if a late payment amount is expressed as a percentage of an outstanding invoice, this may not always mean that the late payment amount is interest. It will depend on whether the late payment amount exhibits enough of the characteristics of penalty or default interest to be categorised as such. It is anticipated that most "one-off" fees will be captured by section 5(24) irrespective of how they are calculated. However, there will always be scope for part of any upfront fee to be categorised as interest if there are compelling reasons for doing so.

The majority of late payment fees will be charged in instances when there are regular billing arrangements between the supplier and recipient (it is unlikely that credit would be extended without a regular billing arrangement or some commercial history between the parties). It is therefore expected that the tax invoice documenting the late payment fee will simply form part of a subsequent invoice for "regular" goods or services provided. When such an arrangement is not in place, a separate invoice for the late payment fee will need to be issued in order to allow the recipient to claim an associated input tax deduction.

Although the late payment fee is, from a policy perspective, an increase in consideration for the underlying goods and services, the mechanics of section 5(25) mean that the late payment fee is a separate supply. The normal time of supply rules will apply to treat the late payment fee as being supplied at the time of the subsequent invoice, so the credit/debit note provisions in section 25 will not apply.

New section 5(26) clarifies that the tax treatment of the late payment fee will follow the treatment of the underlying supply, be this fully taxable, zero-rated or exempt. For example, if the late payment fee was in relation to an exempt financial service, the late payment fee will itself be exempt. If the fee is in relation to a composite supply or more than one supply, part of which is taxable and partly exempt, the GST on the fee should proportionately (by value) follow the treatment of the underlying supply/supplies.

### Application date

As this amendment confirms existing policy, and the practice of the majority of registered persons, the application date is 1 April 2003. However, to recognise the fact that some registered persons currently do not charge GST on late payment fees, if a person has previously adopted a regular practice of not charging GST, they must apply the new rules only to fees charged by them from 1 January 2013.

[Compliance and penalties](/new-legislation/act-articles/compliance-and-penalties "Compliance and penalties")

Late payment of employer monthly schedule amounts
=================================================

2007 amendment introduces a graduated penalty that applies when an employer has filed an employer monthly schedule but not paid the associated tax.

#### Sections 141E, 141ED, 149(2), 149(5), 183A(1)(i), 183D(1)(bd) and 183F(1)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994

A new graduated penalty has been introduced that applies when an employer has filed an employer monthly schedule but not paid the associated tax and replaces the shortfall penalties that might apply in these circumstances. Inland Revenue will contact the employer and, if payment or an arrangement for payment is not made, a 10 percent penalty will be imposed. This reduces to 5 percent if the employer pays the outstanding amount within one month of the penalty being imposed. If the payment is not made, the process repeats itself - that is, another 10 percent penalty is imposed, which reduces to 5 percent if payment is made or an instalment arrangement is entered into within one month. The penalty is capped at 150 percent - the rate of the shortfall penalty for evasion.

#### Background

One of the basic tax obligations of employers is to withhold PAYE on behalf of their employees and pay the PAYE and other amounts deducted to Inland Revenue by specific dates. If the employer fails to pay Inland Revenue on time, penalties will apply. Non-payment of these amounts may be regarded more seriously than failure to pay other taxes, as they place a special responsibility on the employer to make payment on behalf of the employee.

The penalties that may generally apply in relation to this obligation include late filing penalties, late payment penalties, shortfall penalties for evasion and prosecution.

The discussion document, _Tax penalties, tax agents and disclosures_, noted that when considering non-compliance in relation to these obligations there are a number of possible scenarios, including:

*   employers who have some or all of their employees outside the PAYE system;
*   employers who pay the amounts deducted to Inland Revenue but do not file the employer monthly schedule; and
*   employers who file the employer monthly schedule but do not pay the deductions to Inland Revenue.

In relation to the first scenario, it was considered that the penalty rules should continue to apply. In the second scenario, penalties would be limited because the tax is paid. In the third situation, when the employer files the schedule but does not pay the amount deducted, the previous rules gave rise to a number of concerns:

*   _Distortionary outcomes in different situations_: A taxpayer with a good record of tax compliance incurred the same (or a higher) level of penalty as a taxpayer with a record of non-compliance. An employer who failed to file an employer monthly schedule could be eligible for a 75 percent reduction for voluntary disclosure, while an employer who filed an employer monthly schedule, but did not pay, was not eligible for any voluntary disclosure penalty reduction as disclosure had already occurred. This effectively provided a disincentive for employers to file.
*   _A lack of opportunity for taxpayers to correct non-compliance_: The shortfall penalty for evasion could be imposed the day after the amounts deducted have not been paid to Inland Revenue, leaving taxpayers with little opportunity to address non-payment.
*   _A perception that the current rules may be harsh_: In theory, taxpayers could incur shortfall penalties for evasion (150 percent of the unpaid amount) plus the initial late payment penalties, even if payments were made only a few days late.

The amendment introduces a new penalty aimed at encouraging employers to pay any outstanding amounts associated with employer monthly schedules by providing better incentives to comply.

#### Key features

The new penalty is intended to better reflect the degree of seriousness shown by employers in meeting their PAYE obligations, while adopting a more graduated approach is intended to provide better incentives for taxpayers to correct any non-compliance.

Shortfall penalties for evasion will not be imposed if the employer files the employer monthly schedule but does not pay the amounts deducted. Instead, Inland Revenue will contact the employer to establish the reason for the non-payment and offer to assist the employer to establish or enhance its systems to ensure future compliance.

Inland Revenue is required to notify the employer that a 10 percent shortfall penalty for not paying the employer monthly schedule amount will be imposed if payment, or an arrangement for payment, is not made within a month.

If the employer does not make the payment or enter an instalment arrangement, the shortfall penalty of 10 percent of the unpaid amount will be imposed. If the amount is paid within a month of the penalty being imposed, the penalty will reduce from 10 percent to 5 percent.

If payment is not made, the process repeats itself - that is, another 10 percent penalty will be imposed, which will reduce to 5 percent if payment is made within a month. The penalty will not exceed 150 percent in total - the rate of the shortfall penalty for evasion.

This penalty is aimed at encouraging employers to pay the outstanding tax associated with an employer monthly schedule. Compliance includes entering into an instalment arrangement. If the employer enters an instalment arrangement the new penalty does not apply, unless the employer defaults on an instalment arrangement. In this case, the penalty is imposed at 10 percent, with no reduction to 5 percent.

The normal late payment penalties, use-of-money interest and ability to prosecute continue to operate in the normal manner.

The new penalty does not apply if a receiver or liquidator is appointed after the end of the return period and they have insufficient funds to pay the outstanding amount. Inland Revenue already has a debt priority in relation to PAYE, which ensures that liquidators and receivers adopt the measures available towards payment of amounts deducted from employees to Inland Revenue.

The penalty can be written off under the debt and hardship rules, and can be remitted for reasonable cause (section 183A) and if remission is consistent with Inland Revenue's duty to collect the highest net revenue over time (section 183D). As is the normal practice with penalties, the penalty is not imposed on amounts of less than $100.

#### Application date

The amendment applies to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2008.

Scammers cold-calling businesses to offer savings and discounts on tax bills

11 November 2022

We have seen an increase in scammers cold-calling business customers. The scammers pretend to be from real businesses and offer savings of up to 50% on tax bills (including small business loans). They may say they are offering discounts because they have vouchers which are about to expire.

The scammer pays the tax bill to us in full and the victim pays the discounted amount to the scammer.  Meanwhile, the scammer cancels the payment to us, leaving the victims out of pocket and with a tax bill to pay.

The scammers are using several names including Discount Club/Wel Network/Wel Network Marketing. We will never contact businesses to offer ‘discounts’ on your tax debt. If you cannot pay your tax debt, get in touch with us to talk about your options.

Lawyer who lent money to clients denied deduction for bad debts
===============================================================

The disputant is a solicitor in sole practice who claimed two deductions for bad debts in respect of loans he had extended to clients of his legal practice.

Case

XXX v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2018\] NZTRA 03

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994 ss 3, 15B, 138G, 141A, 141FB, 141I and 149; Income Tax Act 2007 ss BD 4, DB 31, DA 1 and EW 29; Insolvency Act 2006 s 304.

### Summary

The disputant is a solicitor in sole practice who claimed two deductions for bad debts in respect of loans he had extended to clients of his legal practice. The Taxation Review Authority (“the Authority”) found that the deductions were not allowed because the disputant had not shown that he had written the debts off as bad in the income year in which he had claimed them, nor were the debtors released from their obligations to pay by operation of law in that income year. Furthermore, the Authority found that the disputant had not satisfied the requirement of carrying on a business which included dealing in or holding financial arrangements. A shortfall penalty was imposed for not taking reasonable care under s 141A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the TAA”).

### Impact

The decision provides the first authority in respect of the application of subsection DB 31(1)(a)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“the ITA”) which was inserted in the legislation on 27 February 2014 with retrospective effect to debts that go bad on or after 1 April 2008.

The position taken by the Authority in respect of the existence of the public ruling and the imposition of shortfall penalties provides a nuance of the legal position as taken in _Easy Park Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2017\] NZHC 1893 ("_Easy Park_"). In _Easy Park_ Ellis J reasoned that the existence of a public ruling suggested the subject matter was difficult and controversial and went on to find that the tax position taken by the plaintiff was not unacceptable for the purpose of imposing shortfall penalties under s 141B of the TAA. The Authority in the present case also considered that the public ruling signified a complexity of the law, but found that a reasonable person in the disputant’s circumstances ought to have sought legal or tax advice before taking the tax positions when confronted with complex and technical legislation. Shortfall penalties were therefore found to have been properly imposed for failing to take reasonable care under s 141A of the TAA.

The Authority otherwise applies settled legal principles (including the business test laid down in _Grieve v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682) in considering the application of s DB 31 of the ITA and whether the disputant could avail himself of any of the listed exceptions to the general rule that deductions for bad debts are not allowed.

### Facts

The disputant, a barrister and solicitor in sole practice, operated the ‘Benevolence on the Conscience Loan Fund’ (“the Fund”) from which he extended loans to clients of his legal practice. The disputant described the Fund as adjunct to and part and parcel of his legal practice. His money lending services were extended only to longstanding clients who met his criteria of being people of good standing who could benefit from his assistance and where the need for assistance was related to a matter arising in the course of the disputant acting for the client.

In return, the clients had to agree to treat the disputant equitably. On this basis, the disputant hoped that the clients would pay him a bonus as well as interest on the lending. The disputant explained the benevolence part of the lending was that if clients could not pay it would be against his conscience to bankrupt them.

In his 2011 income tax return the disputant claimed deductions in respect of two loans of $50,000 and $300,000 which he had written off as bad debts.

The first loan was recorded in a basic loan agreement dated 12 July 2006, the terms of which provided that the borrower authorised the disputant to pay the net loan advance of $44,000 to the bank account held in the name of a company (“XY Limited”) and $4,000 to “Mr C”. The loan provided that it was to be a ‘short term of loan: repayable on demand with interest at 10% on repayment’. The loan was unsecured.

The second loan was made by the disputant to “Mr T” and was recorded in a loan agreement in similar form dated 20 December 2006. This loan was also unsecured and described as being short term: “Repayable on demand with fair interest to you \[the disputant\] on repayment”.

The disputant also claimed to have made at least three further loans of $200,000, $1,300,000 and $595,000 from the Fund since its inception in 2005. A previous loan of $20,000 was made in 1998. A loan agreement detailed that this loan was secured against a motor vehicle, interest of 22.4% per annum, default rate of 25% per annum. The borrower defaulted and the disputant had issued proceedings. The disputant explained he had not written off this debt as bad in his accounts as the borrower had been an associate and not a client of the firm.

### Decision

The Authority first noted that the general rule is that deductions are not available for bad debts, subject to certain exceptions set out in s DB 31 of the ITA. Her Honour then went on to consider whether those exceptions applied.

_Loans not physically written off as bad in the income year_

Her Honour noted that the issue for determination is whether the debt has in fact been written off as bad in whatever books of account or accounting procedures are kept by the taxpayer. The disputant’s evidence was that he operated a single-entry accounting system based on excel spreadsheets. He claimed that his legal executive had noted the write-offs in the profit and loss spreadsheet at the time the disputant became aware of Mr T’s bankruptcy and when Mr C’s company had been struck off the Companies Register.

The investigator gave evidence that in his experience profit and loss accounts were usually prepared after the end of the financial year as it was then that all the final figures were available. The investigator also gave evidence that he had checked the metadata of the profit and loss excel spreadsheet and noted that the document was created on 20 September 2011 (i.e. in the 2012 income year).

Her Honour noted that the legal executive had not been called to give evidence and found the disputant’s evidence as to the steps taken by her to be unreliable. Accordingly her Honour found the debts had not been physically written off during the 2011 income year so as to satisfy the requirements in s DB 31(1)(a)(i) of the ITA.

_Loans not released by operation of law_

The Authority first found that the $50,000 loan had been extended to Mr C as an individual as opposed to XY Limited, as evidenced from the loan agreement which used personal pronoun throughout. As such it was the Insolvency Act 2006 (“the IA”) as opposed to the Companies Act 1993 which contained the operative provisions which could release a loan by law. Section 304(1) of the IA provides that a person is released from their debts upon discharge from bankruptcy. As Mr C had never been adjudicated bankrupt and Mr T was only discharged from bankruptcy in 2013, the requirements in s DB 31(1)(a)(ii) of the ITA in respect of the debts being released by operation of law had not been met.

_Disputant did not carry on a business which included holding financial arrangements_

The Authority held that the disputant had not carried on a business which included holding financial arrangements. While her Honour accepted that the disputant had a profit making intention when extending the loans the disputant had committed very little time or effort on the operation of the Fund and the lending activities of the Fund were not carried out on anything like a commercial basis. The disputant had not required periodic payments of either interest or principal and the disputant had not taken any steps to recover any of the outstanding balances and did not take security for the loans. The disputant’s evidence was that he had forgotten about the loan to Mr C until he was approached by Mr C for a second loan in 2009. Furthermore, the disputant had not advertised his moneylending services and had in fact required the confidentiality from his clients in respect of his lending to them.

Her Honour characterised the lending activity as that of a private individual using his capital funds to make loans to assist clients in financial difficulty who also meet his lending criteria. Accordingly, the requirements under s DB 31(3) had also not been met.

_Deduction not allowed under general permission_

The disputant argued that if a deduction was not available under s DB 31 of the ITA then a deduction should be allowed under the general permission. The Authority noted that s DB 31(6) set out the relationship between s DB 31 and subpart DA and found that as s DB 31(3) overrides the general permission it was not necessary to consider whether a deduction is available under the general permission once a determination is reached under s DB 31(3).

_Shortfall penalties properly imposed_

The Authority found that shortfall penalties for failing to take reasonable care pursuant to s 141A of the TAA had been properly imposed. The disputant had failed to act with the degree of care expected of a taxpayer in his position in not satisfying the obligations placed on taxpayers under s 15B of the TAA. The Authority further found that the disputant, when faced with complex and technical legislation, should have sought advice from a tax advisor before claiming sizable deductions which would necessarily result in a tax shortfall if the disputant was wrong in his application of the law.

Leadership
==========

Transformational journeys need to be led from the very top. Your Chief Executive Officer must both understand the magnitude of transformational change and be its greatest advocate.

The Chief Executive Officer will require the members of the wider leadership team to hold their nerve, through constant resistance and the high-risk demands before them. It is not a job for the faint-hearted.

Your executive leadership team
------------------------------

Executive teams will need to devote significant time to the transformation journey, it is not something that can be delegated.

Start with the assumption that most executives have experienced change, but they have not experienced 'transformational change'. Good executives can and will learn along the way but asking them to lead from the start increases the risk of failure.

Bring transformational experience into the executive team and consider expanding the team further. This to allow responsibilities to be shared and provide space for the executive team to immerse itself in the transformation

This happened at Inland Revenue. The Chief Executive Officer created 2 new roles – a Chief Technology Officer and Chief Finance Officer, which were filled from within the organisation and 2 new Deputy Commissioners recruited form outside the organisation:

1.  Our Deputy Commissioner, Change and Senior Responsible Officer was an experienced business and information, communications, and technology executive. This role was responsible for leading and coordinating all change activities, including Business Transformation.
2.  Our Deputy Commissioner, Information, Intelligence, and Communications had extensive experience in customer engagement and analysis to provide the right capability to support transformation.

You need to consider if you have the right team at the top – these are not easy journeys. The executive team must be on the same page and if they are not, then you may need to let some go gracefully.

The executive team may change over the course of the transformation. New leaders will want to make their mark on the organisation and this needs to be accepted. They need to be given time to understand the change and an opportunity to challenge it.

Your programme leadership team
------------------------------

Hire a team of experts to augment the internal teams – this is essential. It is important to understand that these people are unlikely to be found inside the organisation.

It can be a tough lesson. While many organisations, including Inland Revenue have successfully delivered change in the past, it is generally a single product or part of the organisation - transformation is on a different scale.

Look for people who have run transformations before. In, general they are likely to be highly motivated contractors from the private sector, typically working outside Wellington and potentially New Zealand.

If you can bring these people in house, rather than relying on an outsourced model, you will have 2 big advantages:

*   Their accountability from that point on is to you, not to an external company. You can and will partner up with external consultancies, but you must understand that they are working for their company not yours.
*   As members of your new team are likely to have worked for external consultancies themselves, they know how to get the best from a consultancy. This includes helping you carefully manage scope, expectations, delivery and costs, which ultimately can lead to significant cost savings.

The skillset required to deliver transformational change includes an intense focus on planning, reporting, risk management and documentation. This can be overwhelming for the organisation at first. In Inland Revenue’s case it led to a cultural shift – where people became more accurate in their planning and accountable for meeting their commitments.

Inland Revenue’s Programme leadership team
------------------------------------------

Inland Revenue's business transformation Programme Leadership Team was made up of a mix of transformation veterans, former consultants and technical specialists, joined by a core base of Inland Revenue people with deep institutional knowledge.

### In-house expertise

Leaders who joined the Programme Leadership Team from within our organisation included subject matter experts, who were the vital link between the programme team and the 'business' and also quieter leaders, who did considerable work connecting different strands within the programme, with the wider organisation, and with external stakeholders.

These people were vital as without their deep understanding of government, the public sector and Inland Revenue, the programme would likely have taken a far more circuitous path.

### The right mix of people

Of the transformation specialists, though recruited individually, many had worked together before, ensuring a high degree of trust and mutual respect. The new blood from both inside and outside the organisation enriched the team and brought new and different skills to the group.

Building an expert leadership team is obviously important but keeping them together is critical. The Programme Leadership Team remained one of the most stable groups on the programme. The individuals complemented each other, not just in terms of skills, but also in terms of attitude, approach, philosophy and behaviour. It’s a group that enjoyed being around each other. That can not be underestimated when the pressure comes on.

Lease inducement and lease surrender payment measures
=====================================================

2013 legislation reforms the income tax treatment of land-related lease inducement and lease surrender payments.

_Sections CC 1B, CC 1C, DB 20B, DB 20C, EA 3, EI 4B and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

The tax treatment of land-related lease inducement and lease surrender payments has been reformed for income tax purposes. Lease inducement and lease surrender payments are treated as taxable income to the recipient and deductible to the payer under the Income Tax Act 2007. The reforms are intended to make the tax treatment of lease-related payments fairer and more efficient for businesses, by removing a tax advantage that under the previous rules had the effect of distorting business decisions on leases.

### Background

The New Zealand tax system generally maintains the capital-revenue boundary: capital receipts are generally not taxed, whereas revenue receipts are taxed. The boundary, however, became problematic in the context of certain land-related lease payments.

Following the recent economic downturn, arrangements involving lease inducement payments became a popular option for landlords to attract tenants without needing to reduce the rental amounts payable. Lease inducement payments are unconditional lump sum cash payments generally made by landlords to induce tenants to enter into a commercial lease.

In the absence of specific provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007, lease inducement payments, for income tax purposes, were characterised differently for a payer and a recipient. They were generally non-taxable to a recipient (tenant) and generally deductible to a payer (a commercial landlord who is in the business of leasing). The capital nature of a lease inducement payment was confirmed by the Privy Council in _Wattie_.[1](#01)

Under the previous rules, the tax treatment of lease inducement payments in a commercial context posed a risk to the tax base. It created an opportunity for taxpayers to substitute tax deductible rent payments with non-taxable cash lease inducement payments. Also, compared with other forms of lease inducements such as a rent-free holiday or a contribution towards fit-out costs, these payments provided a tax advantage which distorted business decisions on leases. To address the revenue risk, an officials' issues paper, _The taxation of lease inducement payments_, was released in July 2012, containing a proposal to tax lease inducement payments.

In response to concerns raised in submissions, the Government decided to extend the scope of the reform by including another type of lease payment - lease surrender payments. Lease surrender payments that are generally made by tenants to landlords to surrender existing lease arrangements were treated differently to lease inducement payments for income tax purposes. They were typically taxable to the recipient (commercial landlord) and non-deductible to the payer (tenant). The latter treatment was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in _McKenzies_.[2](#02)
 Lease surrender payments were regarded as "black hole" expenditure to the commercial tenant - that is non-deductible business expenditure.

Lease surrender payments can also be made by landlords to tenants to surrender existing lease arrangements and, in this case, the payments were typically non-taxable to the recipient (tenant) and deductible to the payer (commercial landlord).

The lease inducement and lease surrender payment reforms were the first stage of the two-stage reform process for reforming the taxation of land-related lease payments. The second stage of the reform reviewed the overall tax treatment of land-related lease payments, such as lease transfer payments. An officials' issues paper, _The taxation of land-related lease payments,_ was released in April 2013.

### Key features

The changes fall into two groups. The first group includes amendments relating to the tax treatment of lease inducement payments, namely the charging provision (new section CC 1B), the deduction provision (new section DB 20B), and the timing provision (new section EI 4B). The second group includes amendments relating to the tax treatment of lease surrender payments, namely the charging provision (new section CC 1C) and the deduction provision (new section DB 20C).

Under the amendments relating to lease inducement payments:

*   If a person (the payee) derives an amount as consideration for the agreement by the payee to the grant, renewal, extension, or transfer of a right (the land right) that is a leasehold estate or a licence to use land, the amount is taxable to the payee (new section CC 1B).
*   A related deduction provision is provided (new section DB 20B).
*   A new timing rule allocates the income and deductions from section CC 1B and DB 20B evenly over the period of the land right. An exception applies when the person ceases to hold the relevant land right, or the estate in land from which the land right is granted, during an income year. For income, the remaining amount to be spread under the general timing rule is allocated to that income year. For deductions, the remaining amount to be spread is allocated to that income year if the land right, and the estate in land from which the land right is granted, are not held by the person or an associated person (new section EI 4B).

Under the amendments relating to lease surrender payments:

*   If a person (the payee) derives an amount as consideration for the agreement by the payee to the surrender or termination of a land right (the land right) that is a leasehold estate or licence to use land, the amount is taxable to the payee (new section CC 1C).
*   A related deduction provision is provided (new section DB 20C).
*   There is no specific timing rule for lease surrender payments. The general principles and provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply to determine the timing of income and deductions for lease surrender payments. Generally, income and deductions arising from lease surrender payments are allocated to the income year in which an amount is derived or incurred.

### Application dates

The amendments relating to lease inducement payments (new sections CC 1B, DB 20B and EI 4B) apply to an amount that is derived or incurred on or after 1 April 2013 in relation to a lease or licence entered, renewed, extended, or transferred, on or after that date. A lease includes an agreement to a lease.[3](#03)

The amendments relating to lease inducement payments do not apply to an amount that is derived or incurred on or after 1 April 2013 in relation to a lease or licence entered, renewed, extended or transferred, before 1 April 2013.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| A landlord and a tenant entered into a binding lease agreement on 1 January 2013. The landlord is liable to pay the tenant $100,000 on 1 May 2013 for the agreement to a lease. The lease commences on 1 June 2013.<br><br>![Application dates](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/3/4/3460f8fb-9670-4d8e-bab6-ebb0db2277e0/new-leg-image12.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214357&hash=A18E77455B1B908C926D9BD4655458C1 "Application dates")<br><br>The amendments relating to lease inducement payments do not apply to the $100,000 payment derived by the tenant. The lease is entered into before 1 April 2013 even though the payment is derived after the 1 April date. The tax treatment of the $100,000 lease inducement payment is determined under the general principles and provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007. |     |

The amendments relating to lease surrender payments (new sections CC 1C and DB 20C) apply to an amount that is derived or incurred on or after 1 April 2013.

### Detailed analysis

### _Tax treatment of lease inducement payments_

_Income_

New section CC 1B provides that if a person (the payee) derives an amount as consideration for the agreement by the payee to the grant, renewal, extension or transfer of a land right, the amount is taxable to the payee. The land right must be a right that is a leasehold estate or a licence to use land.

The term "leasehold estate" is defined broadly in section YA 1 to include any estate, however created, other than a freehold estate.[4](#04)
 The charging provision, therefore, does not apply to payments from a freehold estate in land, such as the proceeds from the sale of land.

The charging provision applies broadly because it only focuses on the person who receives the payment - the payee. The payer is not relevant. If a person receives a lease inducement payment on behalf of another person, the existing nominee rules in section YB 21 apply to treat the amount as derived by that other person.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| Examples of payments that are taxable under section CC 1B include:<br><br>*   a payment from a landlord (lessor) to a tenant (lessee);<br>*   a payment from a tenant (sub-lessor) to a sub-tenant (sub-lessee); or<br>*   a payment from a tenant (assignor) to a new tenant (assignee).<br><br>![Tax treatment of lease inducement payments](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/8/1/81b3fe0f-170b-493a-a2ce-006d09328230/new-leg-image13.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214358&hash=F7A4A385D2FBA753DE068F108308732C "Tax treatment of lease inducement payments") |     |

The charging provision does not apply to an amount derived by the payee as the holder of a land right and as consideration for the transfer of the land right to the person paying the amount (section CC 1B(2)).

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| A lease transfer payment received by an assignor from an assignee for the assignment of an existing lease is not taxable under section CC 1B.<br><br>![Tax treatment of lease inducement payments](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/c/2/c2f88611-89b4-459f-b640-67c843a89e2b/new-leg-image14.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214355&hash=1CABD75A7A4748CEA6620D8C0392504A "Tax treatment of lease inducement payments") |     |

The reference to "amount" in section CC 1B uses the definition of "amount" in section YA 1, which includes any amount in money's worth. The charging provision therefore includes consideration other than cash.

Note that some land-related lease payments can be subject to more than one income-charging provision in the Income Tax Act 2007. For example, lease premiums are taxable under sections CC 1 and CC 1B and contributions for fit-out costs are taxable under sections CC 1B and CG 8. However, the tax treatment of amounts that are already subject to sections CC 1 and CG 8, which relate to income from land or capital contributions respectively, do not change. The amount is included in income only once (section BD 3(6)) and the new timing rule for lease inducement payments in section EI 4B does not apply to an amount that is income under section CC 1 and CG 8 (section EI 4B(2)).

_Exception for a tenant or a licensee of residential premises_

An exception for a tenant or a licensee of residential premises applies. The amount is not considered income if the payee is a natural person (individual) and derives the amount as a tenant or licensee of residential premises whose expenditure on the residential premises does not meet the requirements of the general permission.

This exclusion is intended to provide a consistent tax treatment of income and deductions for a tenant or a licensee of residential premises. An individual tenant or a licensee of residential premises is not allowed a deduction for payments of rent because they do not meet the general permission in section DA 1 and the private limitation in section DA 2(2). On the other hand, an accommodation provider, who is not a natural person, is subject to section CC 1B because they would typically be allowed a deduction for payments of rent under the general permission.

If there is a concurrent use of the land right for residential and business purposes, the amount is apportioned accordingly. The amount relating to business purposes is taxable under section CC 1B to the extent that a tenant or a licensee whose expenditure on the premises is allowed a deduction under the general permission in section DA 1.

_Deductions_

New section DB 20B provides that lease inducement payments are deductible to a person (the payer) if the following conditions are met:

*   a person (the payer) incurs an amount of expenditure as consideration for the agreement by another person (the payee) to the grant, renewal, extension or transfer of a right (the land right) that is a leasehold estate or a licence to use land;
*   the payer is the person who owns the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted; and
*   the payee is the person who is obtaining the land right.

The deduction provision allows deductions for other forms of lease inducements, in particular, contributions for fit-out costs. A consequence of this is that the timing rule for deductions in new section EI 4B (discussed below) applies to these payments.

New section DB 20B overrides the capital limitation in section DA 2(1). The general permission in section DA 1 must still be satisfied and the other general limitations in section DA 2 still apply.

_Timing of income and deductions_

New section EI 4B is a timing provision for lease inducement payments. The timing provision applies to the amount of income under section CC 1B or deductions under section DB 20B that is derived or incurred in relation to:

*   a right (the land right) that is a leasehold estate or a licence to use land; and
*   a period (spreading period).

The "spreading period" means a period that:

*   begins with the commencement, or a renewal or extension, of the land right; and
*   ends before the earliest following date on which the land right may be terminated, or may expire, if not extended or renewed.

In other words, the spreading period is an initial fixed period set either at the grant, renewal or extension of the land right. The rationale for this approach is to avoid complexities around adjusting the spreading period (and relevant income and deduction allocations) when the initial fixed period is later modified, renewed or extended. If there is a payment for a renewal or extension of the land right, the payment is spread over the fixed renewal or extension period because that period is regarded as a separate spreading period.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 1 |     |
| A landlord and a tenant enter into a 5-year lease, which includes two 5-year renewal rights. The lease commences on 1 April 2013. On the same day, the tenant receives a lease inducement payment from the landlord.<br><br>The spreading period of the lease inducement payment, which is subject to sections CC 1B and DB 20B, is from 1 April 2013 (being the commencement date of the lease) to 31 March 2018 (being the earliest following date on which the lease expires). |     |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 2 |     |
| Following on from the above example, in March 2018, the tenant decides to renew the lease for another 5 years (from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2023). In January 2022, there is an oversupply of leases in the market. The tenant wants to move to other premises for a lower rent. Knowing this, the landlord makes a lease inducement payment to the tenant for the renewal of the lease for another 5 years (from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2028). The tenant renews the lease for another 5 years.<br><br>The spreading period of the second lease inducement payment is from 1 April 2023 (being the commencement date of the second renewal period) to 31 March 2028 (being the earliest following date on which the lease expires). Although the payment was made in January 2022, the tenant derives the payment in relation to the second renewal period of the lease. |     |

Section EI 4B(3)(a) allocates income and deductions for lease inducement payments. The amount of income and deductions is allocated proportionately to the number of months in an income year over the spreading period.

Given that lease inducement payments are generally made at the commencement of a land right, the amount is allocated evenly over the spreading period. Even when the amount is derived or incurred before the commencement of the land right, the amount is allocated in relation to the spreading period, not when the amount is incurred or derived.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| On 1 April 2013, a tenant receives $100,000 from a landlord as consideration for the agreement to enter into a 10-year lease that commences on the same day. The tenant and the landlord both have a 31 March balance date.<br><br>_The tenant_<br><br>Under section CC 1B, $100,000 is taxable to the tenant. Under section EI 4B, the income is spread evenly over the 10-year period from the 2013-14 to the 2022–23 income years inclusive (ie, $10,000 income is allocated to the tenant in each income year).<br><br>_The landlord_<br><br>Under section DB 20B, $100,000 is deductible for the landlord. Under section EI 4B, the deductions are spread evenly over the 10-year period from the 2013-14 to the 2022-23 income years inclusive (ie, a deduction of $10,000 is allocated to the landlord in each income year). |     |

The allocation of income and deductions for lease inducement payments is affected by when the income or expenditure is derived or incurred in relation to the spreading period. For example, if the amount is derived or incurred half-way through the spreading period, the amount is spread evenly over the remaining spreading period. If the amount is derived or incurred at or after the end of the spreading period, the amount is allocated to the income year in which it is incurred or derived.

If the spreading period is more than 50 years, the amount is allocated evenly over the first 50 income years (section EI 4B(3)(a)(iii)).

Note that, under the timing provision, an amount of expenditure incurred by an assignor to induce an assignee to receive an assignment of a lease is allocated to the income year in which the amount is incurred. By assigning the lease, the assignor has no remaining period over which to spread the expenditure. On the other hand, the assignee spreads the amount of income evenly over the remaining period of the lease.

Example 

On 1 April 2014, a tenant enters into a 10-year lease. However, after three years, the tenant finds that their business is not doing well and finds the lease burdensome.

The tenant becomes aware that A Ltd is looking for premises. The tenant is keen for A Ltd to take the lease. On 1 October 2017, the tenant pays $30,000 to A Ltd to transfer the lease from that date.

![Tax treatment of lease inducement payments](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/8/8/8876dce6-acf9-42e3-a674-d18a43a2ed2d/new-leg-image15.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214354&hash=2398E128A5799ADB80C3170865D1AC9D "Tax treatment of lease inducement payments")

The timing of income and deductions for the tenant and A Ltd under section EI 4B is illustrated in the table below. The tenant and A Ltd have a 31 March balance date.

| Income year | The tenant (assignor) |     | A Ltd (assignee) |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Deduction | Income | Deduction | Income |
| 2014-15 | \-  | \-  | \-  | \-  |
| 2015-16 | \-  | \-  | \-  | \-  |
| 2016-17 | \-  | \-  | \-  | \-  |
| 2017-18 | $30,000 | \-  | \-  | $2,308 |
| 2018-19 | \-  | \-  | \-  | $4,615 |
| 2019-20 | \-  | \-  | \-  | $4,615 |
| 2020-21 | \-  | \-  | \-  | $4,615 |
| 2021-22 | \-  | \-  | \-  | $4,615 |
| 2022-23 | \-  | \-  | \-  | $4,615 |
| 2023-24 | \-  | \-  | \-  | $4,615 |

The timing provision does not apply to an amount that is treated as income under section CC 1 or CG 8, which relate to income from land or capital contributions respectively. Income under section CC 1 is taxable when derived unless the timing rule in section EI 7 applies. Income under section CG 8 is spread evenly over 10 years unless the payee chooses to reduce the cost base of the depreciable property under section DB 64.

The following example explains how the timing provision would apply to a contribution towards the cost of a fit-out.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| On 1 April 2013, a tenant receives a lease inducement payment of $100,000 from its landlord to enter into a 12-year lease. The terms and conditions of the agreement require that the tenant must use the payment for a fit-out of their lease premises.<br><br>The tenant spends a total of $300,000 on its fit-out in the 2013-14 income year. The tenant and the landlord both have a 31 March balance date.<br><br>_The tenant_<br><br>The tenant can either choose to return $100,000 as income over the next 10 years, starting from the 2013-14 income year, or reduce the cost base of the fit-out by $100,000. Under the latter option, the tenant is only able to claim depreciation on the remaining $200,000 of expenditure incurred on the fit-out.<br><br>_The landlord_<br><br>The landlord is allowed a deduction of $100,000 under section DB 20B, which is allocated under section EI 4B over the 12-year period from the 2013-14 to the 2024-25 income years inclusive (ie, a deduction of $8,333 is allocated to the landlord in each income year). |     |

_Disposal of the land right part-way through the spreading period_

An exception applies to the new timing rule if the person ceases to hold the relevant land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted. Generally, a "wash-up" calculation of income and deductions is allowed if a person ceases to hold the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted, part-way through the spreading period (section EI 4B(4) and (5)).

For income, if there is a remaining amount to be allocated under the main spreading provision in section EI 4B(3), the amount of income is allocated to an income year (the balance year) ending before the end of the spreading period, if:

*   at the beginning of the balance year, the person holds the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted; and
*   in the balance year, the person ceases to hold the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted (section EI 4B(4)).

Example 

On 1 April 2013, a landlord pays a tenant $100,000 as an inducement to enter into a 10-year lease. On 1 June 2016, the tenant transfers the lease to a new tenant. Both the landlord and the tenant have a balance date of 31 March.

The $100,000 payment is taxable to the tenant under section CC 1B and deductible to the landlord under section DB 20B.

![Disposal of the land right part-way through the spreading period](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/6/f/6fe5232b-1874-46ef-9240-3a6387ac8304/new-leg-image16.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214356&hash=E375CABC6AEF998970B5D73186EEDB63 "Disposal of the land right part-way through the spreading period")

The timing of income for the tenant under section EI 4B(4) is illustrated in the table below:

| Income year | Tenant |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deduction | Income |
| 2013-14 | \-  | $10,000 |
| 2014-15 | \-  | $10,000 |
| 2015-16 | \-  | $10,000 |
| 2016-17 | \-  | $70,000 |
| 2017-18 | \-  | \-  |
| 2018-19 | \-  | \-  |
| 2019-20 | \-  | \-  |
| 2020-21 | \-  | \-  |
| 2021-22 | \-  | \-  |
| 2022-23 | \-  | \-  |

The landlord continues to allocate the $100,000 deduction under the main spreading provision in section EI 4B(3).

For deductions, if there is a remaining amount to be allocated under the main spreading provision in section EI 4B(3), the amount of deductions is allocated to an income year (the balance year) ending before the end of the spreading period if:

*   at the beginning of the balance year, either or both the land right and the estate in land from which the land right is granted are held by the person or an associated person; and
*   at the end of the balance year, neither of the land right and the estate in land from which the land right is granted are held by the person or an associated person (section EI 4B(5)).

Note that if the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted is transferred to an associated person, no "wash-up" calculation for deductions is allowed. The remaining amount of deductions continues to be allocated over the spreading period under section EI 4B(3). This is intended as an anti-avoidance measure to prevent the timing of deductions being accelerated by transferring the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted to an associated person.

The definition of "land provision" in section YA 1 has been amended so that the definition of "associated person" applying in section EI 4B is the one applicable to land provisions.

Example 

On 1 April 2013, a landlord pays a tenant $100,000 as an inducement to enter a 10-year lease. On 6 June 2016, the landlord sells the freehold land to an unassociated third party. Both the landlord and the tenant have a balance date of 31 March.

![Disposal of the land right part-way through the spreading period](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/c/b/cb1ea671-ac59-44fa-a756-c8956df94f3d/new-leg-image17.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214358&hash=87ABE619FAA2E15A78B65C3810F5178F "Disposal of the land right part-way through the spreading period")

The $100,000 payment is taxable to the tenant under section CC 1B and deductible to the landlord under section DB 20B.

The timing of deductions for the landlord under section EI 4B(5) is illustrated in the table below:

| Income year | Landlord |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deduction | Income |
| 2013-14 | $10,000 | \-  |
| 2014-15 | $10,000 | \-  |
| 2015-16 | $10,000 | \-  |
| 2016-17 | $70,000 | \-  |
| 2017-18 | \-  | \-  |
| 2018-19 | \-  | \-  |
| 2019-20 | \-  | \-  |
| 2020-21 | \-  | \-  |
| 2021-22 | \-  | \-  |
| 2022-23 | \-  | \-  |

If the landlord had transferred the land to their spouse, the landlord would continue to allocate $10,000 of deductions to each income year until the 2022-23 income year.

The tenant continues to allocate the $100,000 amount of income under the main spreading provision in section EI 4B(3).

To prevent overlap, section EA 3, which relates to the timing of prepayments, has been amended to exclude any amounts subject to this timing provision.

### _Tax treatment of lease surrender payments_

_Income_

New section CC 1C provides that if a person (the payee) derives an amount as a consideration for their agreement to the surrender or termination of a right (the land right) that is a leasehold estate or licence to use land, the amount is taxable to the payee.

The payee must be one of the following:

*   the person who owns the estate in land from which the land right is granted; or
*   the person who owns the land right.

In most cases, lease surrender payments are made by a tenant to a landlord to surrender an existing lease. However, the charging provision also applies if the payment is made by the landlord to the tenant for them to surrender an existing lease.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| Examples of payments that are taxable under section CC 1C include:<br><br>*   a payment from a landlord (lessor) to a tenant (lessee);<br>*   a payment from a tenant (lessee) to a landlord (lessor);<br>*   a payment from a tenant (sub-lessor) to a sub-tenant (sub-lessee);<br>*   a payment from a sub-tenant (sub-lessee) to a tenant (sub-lessor).<br><br>![Tax treatment of lease surrender payments](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/9/1/91f890c6-2c46-4ab7-9e5f-cc68f3bc67bf/new-leg-image18.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214355&hash=FAD2EC43B9C1DF847E8F0543DC9D330C "Tax treatment of lease surrender payments") |     |

If a person receives a lease surrender payment on behalf of another person, the existing nominee rules in section YB 21 apply to treat the amount as derived by that other person.

The term "leasehold estate" is defined broadly in section YA 1 to include any estate, however created, other than a freehold estate[5](#05)
. The charging provision, therefore, does not apply to an amount derived in relation to a freehold estate in land, such as the proceeds from the sale of land.

The reference to "amount" in section CC 1B uses the definition of "amount" in section YA 1, which includes any amount in money's worth. The charging provision therefore includes consideration that is other than cash.

_Exception for a tenant or a licensee of residential premises_

An exception for a tenant or a licensee of residential premises applies. The amount is not income if the payee is a natural person (an individual) and derives the amount as a tenant or licensee of residential premises whose expenditure on the residential premises does not meet the requirements of the general permission.

This exclusion is intended to provide a consistent tax treatment of income and deductions for a tenant or a licensee of residential premises. An individual tenant or a licensee of residential premises is not allowed a deduction for payments of rent because they do not meet the general permission in section DA 1 and the private limitation in section DA 2(2). On the other hand, an accommodation provider, that is not a natural person (ie, they are a company), is subject to section CC 1C because they would typically be allowed a deduction for payments of rent under the general permission.

If there is a concurrent use of the land right for residential and business purposes, the amount is apportioned accordingly. The amount relating to a business purpose is taxable under section CC 1C to the extent that a tenant or a licensee whose expenditure on the premises is allowed a deduction under the general permission in section DA 1.

_Deductions_

New section DB 20C provides that lease surrender payments are deductible to a person (the payer) if the following conditions are met: 

*   the payer incurs an amount of expenditure as consideration for the agreement by another person (the payee) to the surrender of a leasehold estate or the termination of a licence to use land;
*   the payer is a person who owns the land right or a person who owns the estate in land from which the land right is granted; and
*   the payee is a person who owns the estate in land from which the land right is granted, or a person who owns the land right.

Section DB 20C overrides the capital limitation in section DA 2(1). The general permission in section DA 1 must still be satisfied and the other general limitations in section DA 2 still apply.

_Timing of income and deductions_

No specific timing provision is provided for lease surrender payments. The timing of an amount derived or incurred under sections CC 1C and DB 20C is, therefore, determined under the general provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Generally, income and deductions for lease surrender payments are allocated to the income year in which the amount is derived or incurred. This is considered appropriate for lease surrender payments as there would normally be no remaining period of the land right over which the amount can be spread at the time the lease surrender payment is derived or incurred.

3The definition of "lease" in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is defined as a disposition that creates a leasehold estate. The definition of "leasehold estate" includes any estate, however created, other than a freehold estate. The definition of "estate" includes both a legal or equitable estate as well as a right to the possession of the land.

Leave to bring evidence not granted to disputant
================================================

2014 case note - admissibility of evidence and effectiveness of evidence - bad faith, 'lis' in proceeding.

Case

TRA 021/11; \[2014\] NZTRA 16

Legislative References

Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994, Evidence Act 2006, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The disputant was denied leave to bring evidence alleging bad faith on the part of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner"). The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") took into account s 89A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") and the disputant's conduct in these proceedings and found that it was not necessary to admit the disputant's evidence to avoid manifest injustice to the disputant. Further, the TRA was not prepared to exercise its discretion under s 17(1) of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 ("TRAA").

### Impact of decision

The TRA, in determining the admissibility of evidence under s 17 of the TRAA, will consider whether proposed evidence will assist to deal effectively with the matters in the proceeding.

### Facts

The disputant filed submissions alleging that the Commissioner acted in bad faith in making the assessment and sought leave to lead evidence of the alleged actions. The assessment that underlies the dispute was made in August 2009 when the disputant was assessed under s 61 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 as an agent of certain companies for their GST liability.

### Decision

The TRA declined to grant leave to the disputant to bring the proposed evidence alleging bad faith on the part of the Commissioner.

#### _Evidence excluded_

Judge Sinclair noted the relevant statutory provisions of s 17(2A) and s 17(2B) of the TRAA  and pointed out that the disputant's statement of position dated 17 July 2010 did not raise any facts, evidence, issues or propositions of law that related in any way to an allegation of bad faith. The TRA further noted that there has been no application under s 17(2B) of the TRAA or any reasons given as to why the disputant could not at the time of his statement of position "with due diligence" have discovered those matters he now wishes to raise in evidence.

Judge Sinclair moved on to consider two allegations submitted by the disputant which the Commissioner stated could relate to the assessment. Those were that:

1.  the proceeding can have no financial benefit to the Commissioner, therefore the proceeding is predicated on ill will; and
2.  no explanation was provided to the disputant as to why the assessment against him was maintained while the assessment against a co-director was cancelled.

In regard to the first allegation, Judge Sinclair agreed with the Commissioner's submission that the fact that it has subsequently become apparent that there are no assets in the estate to satisfy the debt, does not support an allegation that the assessment was made in bad faith.

With regard to the second allegation, Judge Sinclair found this matter irrelevant as to whether or not the disputant had been correctly assessed. Judge Sinclair stated that under s 81 and s 6(2) of the TAA the disputant is not entitled to an explanation from the Commissioner in respect of the tax affairs of another taxpayer.

Judge Sinclair found the evidence the disputant wished to raise to be unrelated to the assessment and not relevant to the issues for her determination. Allowing the disputant to bring fresh evidence (the disputant intended to call 12 witnesses) would cause further delay in finalising the matter.

Having taken into account s 89A of the TAA and the disputant's conduct in these proceedings, Judge Sinclair found that it is not necessary to admit the disputant's evidence in order to avoid manifest injustice to the disputant.

#### _Admissibility of evidence under s 17(1) of the TRAA_

Judge Sinclair stated that even if she is wrong in her analysis under s 17(2B), she is not prepared to admit this evidence exercising her discretion under s 17(1) of the TRAA.

Judge Sinclair considered ss 17(1) and 17(3) of the TRAA and s 7 of the Evidence Act 2006 and found that the disputant's proposed evidence did not have any probative value in these proceedings. The events which were alleged to have occurred since the making of the assessment were not evidence of any particular pattern of behaviour by the Commissioner.

Judge Sinclair, having referred to _Dandelion Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1997\] 2 NZLR 96 approved by the Court of Appeal in _Dandelion Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2003\] 1 NZLR 600 ("_Dandelion_") did not consider that the proposed evidence "may" be of assistance to her in dealing with the matters for determination in this proceeding.

#### _Commissioner has no "lis" in this proceeding_

The disputant also sought leave to refer to s 177C(2) of the TAA which requires the Commissioner to write off the tax claimed in the proceeding as it is accepted by the Commissioner that there will be no recovery from the disputant's bankruptcy.

The disputant claimed that once the tax is written off then the Commissioner will have no _lis_ (described as when an "active dispute exists between specific contesting parties" in _Re 110 Martin Street, Upper Hutt_ \[1973\] 2 NZLR 15) in these proceedings.

Judge Sinclair stated that the Commissioner is not bound by s 177C(2) of the TAA until there has been a final distribution of a dividend from the Official Assignee or notification from the Official Assignee that no dividend is available to pay to the Commissioner for the outstanding tax liability assessed. Judge Sinclair found that that position has not been reached in this case, and stated that even if that position was reached the assessment would remain on foot, as writing off the tax forms part of the enforcement and collection process and does not affect the dispute between the parties.

Leave to continue challenge
===========================

2014 case note - disputant wished to continue litigation and right to a hearing should not be denied - challenge deemed withdrawn, good reason.

Case

TRA 025/11, \[2014\] NZTRA 07

Legislative References

Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998

### Summary

The disputant showed a genuine wish to continue the litigation and the right to a hearing and determination should not be lightly denied. The disputant was granted leave to proceed with the challenge proceeding.

### Impact of decision

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") will not be quick to deem a challenge withdrawn if the application to continue under regulation 32(2)(a) is within the time limits and the disputant can provide a plausible explanation. This was distinguished from regulation 32(2)(b) which has a higher threshold as exceptional circumstances need to be satisfied.

### Facts

This proceeding was set down for a directions hearing on 20 February 2014. The disputant failed to attend the hearing and the challenge was deemed to be withdrawn. The disputant made an application for leave to continue on 27 February 2014.

An affidavit in support was filed by Mr AB who lives in Australia and is the sole director of the disputant. He stated that Mr XY had been the principal person involved in handling this dispute and that on 19 February 2014 Mr XY advised him by email that he was no longer acting on behalf of him in this matter. Mr AB stated he was unaware of the directions hearing, and in any case believed Mr XY was acting on his behalf.

The Inland Revenue investigator stated in an affidavit that during a conversation held on 5 July 2013, Mr XY advised her that he was no longer acting for the disputant and that she should contact Mr AB to obtain new contact details. On 20 August 2013, the investigator stated she met with Mr AB and discussed the status of his challenge proceeding.

Mr XY also filed an affidavit. Mr XY stated that in the middle of 2013, he stopped acting for the disputant in relation to the settlement discussions with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner"). After that he was only engaged on a limited basis regarding small residual matters.

In an email to the TRA on 19 February 2014, Mr XY disclosed he no longer acted for Mr AB. However, in his affidavit, Mr XY stated that this was not strictly true. He believed, because of his diminished role in the matters, attending the hearing was no longer his responsibility. He also stated that Mr AB could have thought the hearing was a procedural matter of which he was still responsible.

The disputant submitted that the evidence of Mr AB and Mr XY are consistent and both state that due to the lack of communication between them, Mr AB thought erroneously that Mr XY was handling the directions hearing.

The Commissioner submitted that the circumstances show there was no room for confusion. Mr AB knew that Mr XY was not acting for him and would not attend the directions hearing.

### Decision

The disputant was granted leave to proceed with this challenge proceeding.

The disputant filed its application within 20 working days of the directions hearing so regulation 32(2)(a) of the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998 applies. The disputant then needed to satisfy the TRA that it had a good reason for failing to attend the directions hearing.

The TRA stated that because the matter was heard on the papers, there was no opportunity to examine the credibility of the witnesses. The TRA was satisfied, based on the investigator's evidence, that there could have been confusion between Mr AB and Mr XY as to Mr XY's involvement in the proceeding.

The TRA recognised that there was no case law on what constitutes a "good reason" for failing to attend a directions hearing and agreed with the disputant's submission that the test for obtaining leave under 32(2)(a) was less demanding than an application under 32(2)(b). The TRA further added that it was mindful that the right to a hearing and determination should not be lightly denied and took into account that having a case withdrawn is a severe consequence for any disputant.

The TRA determined that, while greater care should have been taken, the failure to attend arose from a misunderstanding and was not deliberate and that in the context of the regulation, the explanation provided amounted to a "good reason" for failing to attend.

Te wehe i Aotearoa Leaving New Zealand
======================================

What

Work out whether your tax residency status has changed and what you'll need to do.

Who

New Zealand tax residents leaving New Zealand.

If you're leaving New Zealand, you'll need to know:

*   if your tax residency status has changed
*   whether double tax agreements affect how your New Zealand income is taxed
*   how to finalise your tax position
*   if you have social policy programmes to update.

Working out if your tax residency status has changed
----------------------------------------------------

If you're a [](/api/glossary/item?id={CC613A0F-B2AE-4755-B947-A74A5002A8EF})
New Zealand tax resident, you'll become a [](/api/glossary/item?id={629D26DB-A2DC-4E9F-88E8-397C0AA00D67})
non-resident taxpayer if you both:

*   do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand
*   are away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period. 

[Tax residency status for individuals](/international-tax/individuals/tax-residency-status-for-individuals)

  

If your tax residency status does not change, then you'll continue paying tax as a New Zealand tax resident.

Double tax agreements (DTAs)
----------------------------

Your new country or territory of residence may have a double tax agreement with New Zealand and this may affect how any income from New Zealand is taxed.

[Double tax agreements (DTAs)](/international-tax/double-tax-agreements)

Finalising your tax position
----------------------------

If you're leaving New Zealand and your tax residency status changes, your tax obligations will change.

### Income tax

Your income tax obligations will change when you stop being a New Zealand tax resident and become a non-resident taxpayer.

Your change in tax residency is backdated to when you left New Zealand. If you know you're making a permanent move and you've earned income, you can file an Individual tax return - IR3 before the end of the [tax year](/api/glossary/item?id={963329E3-7E3C-493A-9C3B-6EDA8DB83DDC})
. Show the income you earned between 1 April and the date you left.

*   You can also submit your tax return on the filing date. You'll have more time if you're using a tax agent.
*   If your plans change and you return to New Zealand, you'll need to update us.

If you're still earning income from a New Zealand source after you become a non-resident taxpayer, you may need to pay tax on it.

*   You may need to file a Non-resident individual tax return - IR3NR.

However, you do not need to file if your only income is either:

*   exempt
*   from interest, dividends, and royalties and tax has been deducted correctly.

Portfolio investment entities (PIEs)

A portfolio investment entity is an entity which invests contributions from its investors in different passive investments.

*   If you invest in a PIE and you become a non-resident taxpayer, you'll need to change your prescribed investor rate (PIR) to 28%.
*   However, if you become a notified foreign investor (NFI), you'll be able to invest in zero-rate or variable-rate PIEs at lower rates.

You may need to include income in an Individual tax return - IR3 if you delay in notifying your PIE that your tax residency changed.

Trusts

If you're both a New Zealand tax resident and settlor of a trust and you become a non-resident taxpayer, this will affect how your trust is taxed.

*   We advise you to consult a tax professional before your status changes. It may become a non-complying trust if nothing is done.

If you're a beneficiary and you become a non-resident taxpayer, you'll only pay tax in New Zealand if that income is from a New Zealand source.

*   The trustee should provide you with the information to complete a tax return if necessary.
*   If your only income from the trust is from interest, dividends and royalties and [non-resident withholding tax (NRWT)](/api/glossary/item?id={578794B4-48A0-426D-9A98-A7580953B8D5})
     has been deducted correctly, you will not need to file a return for this income.

If you're a trustee and become a non-resident taxpayer, the settlor who is a New Zealand tax resident will become an agent for the trust.

*   The settlor must pay tax to New Zealand on the trust's income and file a Settlors of trusts disclosure - IR462.
*   The disclosure must be made within 3 months of the trustee becoming a non-resident taxpayer.

Shares in overseas companies

If you have shares in overseas companies and have applied the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules, you'll need to consider how your change in tax residency status affects you.

In general, if you become a non-resident taxpayer, you'll be treated as having sold your interests for market value immediately before the change for the purpose of calculating FIF income. 

*   You may need to consult a tax professional.
*   The FIF rules will not apply to you as a non-resident taxpayer.
*   If you did not need to apply the rules, you'll need to include any dividends you got in your return up to the date you leave.

Financial arrangements rules

Financial arrangements include foreign currency bank accounts, loans and government stock.

If you are party to any of these and you're leaving New Zealand, you may have to do a final calculation called a base price adjustment (BPA).

This is not necessary if you're a cash basis person who is a [transitional tax resident](/api/glossary/item?id={40B013B8-DE6C-49DB-AD13-FF1F0162FEDD})
 and you:

*   were party to the arrangement when you became a New Zealand tax resident and are party when you become a non-resident taxpayer
*   stop being a tax resident before the first day of the fourth income year following the year in which you became a tax resident.

For example, if you became a transitional tax resident on 30 September 2018 and leave before 1 April 2022, you would not need to do the BPA on any financial arrangements you had when you became a tax resident.

The financial arrangements rules will usually not apply to you as a [](/api/glossary/item?id={629D26DB-A2DC-4E9F-88E8-397C0AA00D67})
non-resident taxpayer.

Social policy programmes to update
----------------------------------

If you're leaving New Zealand, there are some programmes that you may need to update, such as student loans, KiwiSaver, Working for Families and child support.

*   The rules and timeframes are different for each programme, so you'll need to check what applies to you.

Legal expenditure allowed if meets "principal purpose" test
===========================================================

2009 case note – Trustees entitled to deduct GST input tax credits for legal services acquired for proceedings - section 3A(1)(a), principal purpose.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Trustees in the Mangaheia Trust and Trustees in the Te Mata Property Trust

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

The High Court found that the trustees of the Mangaheia and Te Mata Property Trusts were entitled to deduct GST input tax credits in relation to legal services acquired for litigation proceedings. Legal services acquired by the trustees were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The High Court also found that the "principal purpose" test has to be met before GST on services and supplies can be claimed as an input tax under section 3A(1)(a) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("GST Act").

### Impact of decision

The High Court has clarified the law in regard to the meaning of section 3A of the GST Act. If there is sufficient nexus between the services acquired and the making of the taxable supplies, the services will have been obtained for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies.  

Each case requires a factual inquiry and the "principal purpose" test has to be met before the GST on services and supplies can be claimed as an input tax credit.

Whilst not overturning the Taxation Review Authority's findings of fact, the High Court has confirmed the Commissioner's view that section 3A(1)(a) of the GST Act is more than just a "filter" and stated the law in a fashion not inconsistent with the Commissioner's view that section 3A(1)(a) is to be read in conjunction with section 21 of the GST Act.

For clarity, the Commissioner's position is not that accounting and valuation fees were (and often are) allowed because they do not amount to large sums.

The Commissioner will not appeal this decision.

### Facts

The trustees of the two disputant trusts claimed GST input tax credits for fees for legal services arising out of protracted litigation concerning a number of trusts. The Commissioner disallowed the claims and the disputants successfully challenged that in the Taxation Review Authority; TRA Nos 67/05 and 70/05.

The Commissioner appealed against the decision of the Taxation Review Authority that the Commissioner acted incorrectly in disallowing the two disputant trusts GST input tax credits claimed by the trustees for legal fees.

The Commissioner brought this appeal on the basis of the following:

*   The Authority was incorrect in finding that the legal services acquired and the fees paid by the trusts were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies.
*   The Authority erred in law by reading down the "principal purpose" test required under section 3A of the GST Act.
*   The Authority's approach to the "principal purpose" test was flawed and it was incorrect to say that section 3A(1)(a) of the GST Act operates as a "filter" between the making of taxable supplies and exempt supplies.

### Decision

_**Whether the Authority erred in law by reading down the principal purpose test under section 3A of the GST Act 1985**_

The High Court found that considering whether there is sufficient nexus is an eminently sensible way of approaching the principal purpose test because:

*   ... if there is an insufficient nexus between the acquisition of goods or services in the making of taxable supplies, then logically it could not follow that the goods or services were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. \[23\]

This nexus must be a question of fact. One way of approaching the factual inquiry whether the services were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies is to ask whether there is a sufficient nexus between the services acquired and the making of the taxable supplies. If the principal purpose was something other than the making of taxable supplies then the conclusion should be there was insufficient nexus.

Inherent in the definition of a taxable supply is that it must be in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity.

In terms of claiming for a business expenditure, the reference to "making taxable supplies" is to be read widely. There is no requirement that the specific expenditures on which input tax credits are claimed need to be directly linked to the specific resulting products. This would be contrary to the overall balancing out effect which the legislation seeks to achieve; see _Glenharrow Holdings v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2009\] 2 NZLR 359

On the finding of the Taxation Review Authority that section 3A of the GST Act is a filter, the Court found that:

*   The reference to there being a "filter" was not entirely apt. The principal purpose test has to be met before the GST on services and supplies can be claimed as input tax. \[36\]

The High Court found that the Taxation Review Authority's reference to section 3A of the GST Act as a "filter" is ambiguous, but reading the decision as a whole, there is no doubt that the Authority's decision does not involve any departure from the ordinary meaning of the words "principal purpose".

_**Whether the legal services acquired (and fees paid) by the trusts were for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies**_

It is not appropriate that a presumptive approach that virtually anything a trustee, and thus the trust, does intra vires might meet the "principal purpose" test. There may be circumstances where the "principal purpose" threshold is not met even though a trustee is acting intra vires. Every case is a factual inquiry and in the case of the trusts, regard had to be given to the terms of the trust deed, the taxable activity and the exact nature of the trustee's actions so as to establish on the facts whether the "principal purpose" test has been satisfied.

The High Court found that the Authority did address the need for some nexus between the expenditure on legal fees and the taxable activity of the two trusts.

The Authority was aware of the statutory requirement to apply the exact wording of section 3A of the GST Act and, as a whole, the Authority's decision did not depart from the ordinary meaning of the words "principal purpose".

The Court found that the Authority was correct on the facts and the law, and the two trusts were entitled to claim the GST input tax credits for fees for legal services acquired by the trusts for the purpose of the litigation. The High Court dismissed the Commissioner's appeal.

Legal expenses non-deductible
=============================

2009 case note – whether or not legal expenses are deductible depends on reason for incurring expense - Dairy cooperative merger, legal expenses, capital or revenue.

Case

TRA Number 05/08; Decision Number 14/2009

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

Legal expenses incurred in challenging the differential between the milk payouts to the taxpayers of a merged dairy cooperative were capital in nature and therefore non-deductible.

### Impact of decision

This judgment confirms that whether or not legal expenses are deductible will depend upon the reason for incurring the expense.

### Facts

The disputants were dairy farmers who had been supplying milk solids to a dairy cooperative (Company A). In 1996, Company A merged with another dairy cooperative (Company B).

The directors for both Company A and Company B, expected Company A's shareholders to benefit to a greater degree from the merger than Company B's shareholders. In terms of increased payouts, the merger agreement provided that, following the merger, Company A shareholders would receive a lower payment per unit of milk product supplied to the merged entity (Company B). The difference between the rates of payment for milk products supplied was referred to as "the differential".

The disputants unsuccessfully challenged the differential in the High Court and subsequently appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal where they were also unsuccessful.

For the 2002 to 2005 income tax years, the disputants claimed a deduction for their legal expenses incurred in the High Court and Court of Appeal proceedings. The disputants claimed that the legal expenses were incurred in order to obtain further revenue and were therefore deductible.

The Commissioner disallowed those claims and argued that the differential the disputants sought to recover in the High Court and Court of Appeal proceedings were capital in nature and therefore non-deductible.

### Decision

The expenditure incurred by the disputants in seeking to recover the differential must be calculated from a practical and business point of view in order to determine whether it is capital or revenue in nature.

The Authority found that the differential reflected the value which Company A brought to the merger compared with what Company B brought to the merger. The merger gave company A shareholders a greater benefit than Company B shareholders in terms of an increased payout for milk-products supplied.

Part of the price to be paid by the disputants to participate in and benefit from the merger and to become supplying shareholders of the merged company, was that they accepted less income than other shareholders in Company B.

The Authority agreed with the Commissioner that the reduction in income for the first three or four seasons post merger was the price which the former Company A shareholders paid to belong to the new merged company and it was that price that the disputants sought to recover in the High Court and Court of Appeal litigation.

The fact that the price paid was taken out of the disputants income did not mean that they funded the litigation to achieve more income but that they were seeking to reduce the price required from them by the merged company for the right to supply their milk products to the merged company.

The Authority found that on the evidence presented before it, there was no rational approach to apportionment in this case, because the expenses were wholly capital in nature.

In the final progress update provided to the Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee (GOV) on 7 April 2022, the Minister of Revenue asked us to provide a report by June 2022 outlining: • our views about why we have been successful • what lessons we learned along the way • what we advise other major change programmes to consider, to set themselves up for success. 2. As requested, we have reflected on the successful implementation of our multi-year, multi-stage transformation programme. This report looks at what is needed to put the right foundations in place, what is required to get going, and what is needed during the delivery phase. 3. The programme will close by 30 June 2022. We will continue to further leverage the capabilities that have been delivered, and look for opportunities to further reduce effort for customers and improve their experiences. Getting the right foundations in place (pre-2015) 4. As noted in the progress update (GOV-22-Min 0004 refers), before we sought approval to begin implementing our transformation programme, we ensured that we had the right leadership in place, a clear plan, and the skills, experience and partners we needed to set ourselves up for success. Transformation was led from the top 5. Transformation was an enterprise-wide endeavour, which the Commissioner and executive leadership team led collectively and were accountable for. A Deputy Commissioner had a sole focus on transformation: it cannot be added on to a busy day job. Specific experience with delivering transformational change is required and it is unlikely this will be found within existing teams. Buying in this experience will undoubted ly reduce risk. 6. The executive team devoted significant time to transformation. This is not something that can be delegated. In addition, the executive leadership team was increased in size for a period, to provide the capacity to plan for and lead transformation. This helped to ensure that the programme did not drift off on its own or become disconnected. 3 IR2022/217: Lessons learned during transformation \[IN CONFIDENCE\] We had a clear vision and roadmap for achieving it 7. Our goal was to deliver a modern, digital revenue system that makes tax and payments simpler and more certain for customers. A revenue system: • Based around customers’ needs • Easy to understand and interact with • Using near real-time information • Digital and highly automated • Systems and software doing most of the work • More responsive, flexible, and certain for customers • Future proofed to accommodate change. 8. We established a roadmap early, which set out the starting point (GST) for the programme and the overall phasing. The stages were broad enough to allow us to adjust our approach when needed and as we learnt from the initial phases. While transformations take a long time from start to finish, they need to run at pace with interim deliverables that show progress and build confidence. The roadmap showed simply and visually what we would deliver and when. It was also customer and stakeholder centred. We recognised the need to manage change carefully, and not to overload different customer groups and our people with change all at once. 9. Initially, we had thought there would be on and off ramps in the roadmap, presenting a series of investment decisions o ver the life of the programme. It became apparent, however, that the transition to new systems and processes must be completed once started. T herefore, the major investment decision had to be taken right at the beginning of the programme. 10. While off ramps do not exist in reality for transformational change, if programmes are set up correctly they do provide the ability to adapt and change. For example, in our case we were able to split stages 2 and 3 into a series of smaller releases to reduce risk while still delivering within the planned timeframes. This meant we had more, smaller releases instead of fewer, larger releases. Multi-year funding is critical to enable these types of decisions to be made, as is transparency so that everyone understands what choices have been made and why. 11. We made sure our plans were at the right level and fit for purpose. Not everyone needs to understand multi-thousand-line plans, so we spent time on getting the level of communications right. 12. Strong programme disciplines helped to ensure that we remained on schedule. The scope of the programme was managed tightly to ensure we delivered on time and on budget. Robust programme foundations, including a strong programme management office and a 10 keys reporting framework, helped us to track and report progress regularly and transparently. Once we defined our plan, we locked it and only allowed change via a formal change control process. This was instrumental in establishing the disciplines needed for successful delivery. Policy changes were a critical part of the programme and key to building external support 13. As products were moved to new systems and processes, we made policy changes at the same time to help simplify things for customers and improve how we administer products. The changes made to policy and legislative settings aimed to: • Make it easier for customers to get things right and hard to get wrong. 4 IR2022/217: Lessons learned during transformation \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • Reduce compliance effort and costs for customers. • Enable businesses to focus on running their businesses with tax as a secondary consideration. • Make it more difficult for people to fall into debt and easier for them to manage their payments. • Boost overall levels of compliance. • Support the use of digital technology. 14. Consultation on policy changes was key to helping us to shape the programme and gaining input and commitment from external stakeholders. We began the process in June 2014 with a tax conference, held in conjunction with Victoria University. The aim of the conference was t o help develop a policy vision, map out the key areas for consideration, and help inform concrete policy proposals for full public consultation. 15. Public consultation took the form of a number of government discussion documents and officials’ issues papers released between 2015 to 2020. The first in the Making tax simpler series was a green paper released in March 2015. This sought views on whether the ideas outlined in the paper were heading in the right direction and focused on the right things, before more work was done on them. It provided an opportunity for stakeholders to help set the priorities for change and shape the way we administer the tax system. 16. Policy changes enabled fundamental changes such as automatic end-of -year income tax assessments for individuals to be introduced. Having a clear roadmap and ensuring it was highly visible helped to highlight the most opportune times for making policy changes. 17. In addition, we established reference groups to provide an external perspective across a range of sectors. • The Transformation Reference Group (TRG) met with us approximately three times each year between 2012 and 2021. The TRG included experienced members representing diverse communities and provided valuable advice and input. • In August 2014, the Taxpayer’s Simplification Panel was set up as an avenue to help us hear about the things that frustrated people and to submit ideas about what could be done to make paying tax easier. • In September 2014, we established an Information and Communications Technology (ICT) reference group as an external and independent voice representing interests from across New Zealand’s ICT sector. The purpose of the group was to act as a sounding board for ideas and innovation and to discuss issues and implications as we transformed services for customers. • In March 2020, we established a tax agent cohort to include tax agents more when making changes to our customer-facing products, processes and services. The purpose of the cohort is to contribute to the ongoing continuous improvement of services, provide early insight into design of products, and provide a direct feedback mechanism for the tax agent community and their customers. The cohort represents a range of business sizes and community diversity. We invested in the right capability from the start 18. It i s important to understand what skills and experience are required for transformational change and whether they already exist within the organisation. Most organisations do not have the required expertise in house. Inland Revenue recognised that it did not have the necessary skills and, during 2013 and 2014, recruited an experienced team with a track record in delivering transformational change. 5 IR2022/217: Lessons learned during transformation \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 19. Having very strong commercial skills in the core transformation team was very important, as was having robust commercial practices and processes. These did not exist at the scale required for a major transformation at Inland Revenue before transformation and needed to be created. 20. We put some of our best and brightest people on the programme, with the expectation that many of them would go back into the business as future leaders at the end of the programme. Many did so and have been appointed to key roles in our new organisation design. Having the right partners is critical 21. Collecting tax and making payments is not unique to New Zealand. We invested significant time and effort during 2013 and 2014 in visiting solution providers overseas, and their clients, to determine what software was available and how well it would meet ou r needs. 22. It quickly became apparent that effective commercial solutions were available and used by other revenue authorities. Inland Revenue’s purpose is to collect revenue and make payments, not to be a technology organisation. On this basis, if solutions existed then buying them was the right approach. This helped us to make our core technology decisions early. Buy rather than build became our mantra. 23. Using a commercial-off -the-shelf (COTS) solution provided by FAST Enterprises LLC (FAST) was initially challenging for us, as we had been used to designing and building our own systems. It has proved to be a key decision. Having a COTS solution means that the revenue system is now future-proofed as it can be upgraded via regular software updates, and we benefit from the research and development FAST undertake worldwide. 24. Wherever possible, we ha ve chosen COTS solutions. We have implemented around 10 COTS solutions as part of transformation to run various aspects of our business. COTS solutions include our data and analytics platform, content management systems, and the day-to-day systems that support the running of Inland Revenue such as human resources and finance. We relied strongly on out-of -the-box processes to avoid unnecessary configuration or customisation. Choosing COTS solutions and adopting a cloud-first and as-a-service approach have future-proofed our technology services. 25. We have developed very strong partnerships with our providers and delivery partners, and treat them as being part of our team. Getting started (2015/2016) 26. Having a clear plan about what would be delivered and when, including starting small to prove the approach, provided decision makers with the confidence to fully fund the programme from the outset. Start in a low-risk way 27. We started with GST as it is a standalone and relatively simple tax with a well-defined stakeholder group. This provided us with valuable experience, and the lessons we learned were critical to improving our ongoing delivery. 28. We realised there was a lot we did not know. The key lesson was that we did not really understand what our customers did, or how they used our data and services, as well as we thought we did. This was compounded by the fact that we did not include them 6 IR2022/217: Lessons learned during transformation \[IN CONFIDENCE\] in our design processes. As a result, we changed our approach and brought customers and their advisors into the design process for later releases. Use simple, clear language 29. Simple and clear language helped everyone to understand what we wanted to achieve: make tax and payments simple, open and certain, and buy don’t build. We avoided technical jargon and broad, complicated statements, particularly when communicating to those outside Inland Revenue about what we were doing. 30. These simple statements were used as a focus at each major decision point, and were the principles that underpinned design decisions from the early phases of the programme right through until the end. 31. Right from the Start was another well understood and consistently used phrase that set the scene for design processes and decision-making. 32. For external customers, advertising was centred around Changing for You. This was another simple concept and was supported by messaging about changes, making things more straightforward, and letting customers know how the improvements being made could affect them. A commitment to funding for the long term was secured up front 33. Securing a multi-year appropriation was vital to the success of transformation. Once started, transformation needed to be completed. F unding by stage or release would not have been viable. A multi-year appropriation also enabled us to enter into the long- term commercial contracts needed to support successful delivery. 34. A multi-year appropriation also enabled us to take a risk-based approach to delivery. We were able to move work around where this made sense, and take advantage of opportunities as they arose without funding mechanisms being a constraint. For example, we migrated Working for Families to new systems in April 2019, as it made sense to align this with the migration of income tax. This decision meant we began the transition of social policy products earlier than originally planned. 35. The funding approved allowed for full decommissioning of all heritage processes and systems. This is an area that often gets missed, as programmes tend to run out of time and money at the end. 36. Managing multi-year funding requires robust financial controls. We completed a quantitative risk assessment at each major stage, or at least annually, to determine how we were tracking within the overall funding approved. This meant we could be certain that, at each point during the programme, there was sufficient funding to complete it and deliver the benefits we committed to. We regularly reported to Cabinet about the progress we were making with achieving the benefits. We also provided updates every month to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue on how we were tracking from a cost perspective. 37. We were very clear that the approved funding was not a target. We had a very strong focus on delivering value and controlling costs. As a result, we have been able to hand back a considerable amount of funding to the Crown. We were transparent and published a significant amount of information 38. We have published all major documents, including the business case seeking approval to begin implementation, the regular progress updates provided to Cabinet and Ministers, and the findings of Gateway reviews and independent quality and technical 7 IR2022/217: Lessons learned during transformation \[IN CONFIDENCE\] quality assurance reviews. In our view, this was particularly important, given the significant investment made in transformation. 39. We have engaged with other agencies and organisations, including overseas tax agencies, to share our knowledge as much as possible. 40. We continue to focus on sharing our knowledge, and will shortly publish a range of proven transformational material on our website. This will be available for anyone to access, including other agencies. Supporting strong delivery practices (2017 and onwards) 41. Successful delivery relies on having a continual focus on managing risk, delivering outcomes and benefits, effective change management, and learning as you go. We took a risk-based approach 42. From the outset, we adopted a risk-based approach. This included extensive risk and issues management, including pricing risk into our financial processes, and a comprehensive programme of independent quality assurance reviews. 43. It is difficult at the beginning of a large-scale transformation to have complete clarity, so risk management is very important. The frameworks and plans we put in place upfront recognised a large element of risk, and provided the ability to flex within the initial plan and approach. 44. Risk management was a strong feature of governance, with regular updates provided to our risk and assurance committee, the Treasury and Ministers. 45. Governance evolved, based on learnings at each stage and on the changing risk profile of the programme. Governance arrangements were reviewed regularly and adapted when needed. We had independent members on our governance forums to help make sure we were not hindered by internal group thinking. 46. When we provided our final transformation update to Cabinet in April 2022, the Minister of Finance particularly called out the value he found in the depth and quality of our quality assurance processes and the access he had to the review teams and findings at each review point. We tested, tested and tested again 47. We practised the cut-over from our old to our new system multiple times and tested everything thoroughly. We shared solution designs early and tested them with the wider business and customers. As a result of the groundwork and disciplines we had put in place, we were able to cut-over remotely for the April 2020 release within weeks of New Zealand going into its first COVID-19 lockdown. The two main factors that made this possible were that people had the tools and technology they needed to enable them to work remotely, and the cutover team were very well prepared and very clear about what was required of them. 48. Over the course of the programme, we completed approximately 270,000 tests of various types. We had a dedicated testing team, and brought in subject-matter experts from the business to test different products and services. Customer testing was key to ensuring that our products and services would deliver the outcomes intended. 8 IR2022/217: Lessons learned during transformation \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Our design focused on increasing customers’ use of digital channels 49. One of the key aims of transformation was to make tax and social policy payments as simple and painless as possible. 50. Our intention was to mov e high-volume, simple transactions online so we could free our people up to help customers with more complex needs. However we also recognised that, d espite uptake of digital services, there would always be customers unable or unwilling to use them or who needed to contact us for other reasons. Phone calls and appointments continue to be a key part of our service offering and are available to customers in these situations. Through transformation, we have invested in ensuring that our contact centres, our Community Compliance teams, and front-of -house teams in our offices have continued to be able to support customers. This has been in addition to the investment we have made in digital channels. 51. We made big improvements to our digital services to make it easy for customers to understand their obligations and entitlements in www.ird and manage and track their tax and social policy affairs in their myIR account. We made sure we had a clear view of the outcomes we wanted to achieve, the purpose of our digital channels and what customers valued in them, and what success would look like. We avoided coming up with technology solutions for as long as possible so that we could focus on answering these questions. 52. We focused on the things that would deliver the most value to customers by helping customers to do things differently and better. If you try to do everything, you will not be able to focus on the really important things. We encouraged a less-is-more and close-enough-is-good-enough approach. This helps to avoid the traps of perfectionism and designing for exceptions rather than the majority. 53. It’s important to understand what using digital services and channels will mean for customers and what changes they will need to make to use them. Delivering something new is just the start of changing customer behaviour. A great service might never get used if customers do not get the right support so that they know what to do. New, flash technology is worthless if it doesn’t change customer behaviour. Simple and usable beats fancy and complex every time. 54. We also significantly increased our ability to exchange data with other organisations through digital channels that support our digital service providers. We can now partner more easily with other organisations to deliver services through them and make more of the information we hold easily and securely available to them. This meant building our capability to work with third parties and to ensure we built their development timelines into our plans. A key objective was to be an intelligence-led organisation 55. We recognised that one of the key changes we needed to make was to make more intelligent use of the information we hold to improve outcomes for customers. We aimed to significantly improve the way we collect, store and analyse data and information and make it readily available when it is needed. 56. The analytical capabilities in both the data and intelligence platform (DIP) and our new system START 1 are making it easier for customers to comply and harder not to. We now have a real-time view of issues customers are struggling with, and areas that might require closer investigation. We delivered incrementally, allowing people to learn on the job and understand the opportunities. It is important to emphasize and be comfortable with an incremental approach, as benefits in this area build over time. 1 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology and is the name chosen by Inland Revenue for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC 9 IR2022/217: Lessons learned during transformation \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 57. One of the best practices we adopted was the agile quarterly planning approach which was designed to better inform decision making and deliver better outcomes for customers. It involved people from across Inland Revenue coming together to work collaboratively to align and sequence analytics work. 58. We implemented new information and knowledge management systems, a powerful search engine and replaced our intranet to ensure that our people could easily find and access the information they needed to do their jobs. We found that a combination of systems was best, rather than one repository for everything. This meant we had to understand the minimum mandatory common metadata for all content to enable cross- system searchability. A search first experience is reliant on content that is written with the person who needs it in mind, not how the author thinks about it. The language needs to make sense to the search terms used; so the onus is on the content writers to know their audience. 59. It was important not to underestimate the change management effort required. Available by default is a challenging concept for our people, as it is a big shift from how we have traditionally worked and thought about information. In addition, having an enterprise content model for your information and knowledge systems before implementing them is important so that people know when and how to use each system Information clean-up was treated as a priority and it is important not to underestimate the effort and time required to do this. Leave enough time in your schedule for content owners to clean up their content. We focused on delivering outcomes and benefits 60. Delivering benefits was a significant focus for the transformation programme. Benefits were a mix of financial and non-financial outcomes, and were clearly articulated in our business case. We invested in developing robust benefit identification and management practices from the start of the programme. We progressively delivered benefits as changes were implemented, and regularly tracked and reported progress towards achieving them. At first, we focused on dollars or time saved and, as transformation progressed, we became more customer-focused. The focus then shifted to reflect the benefits of helping customers get it right from the start, rather than punishing them when they got it wrong. 61. The use of case studies helped the benefits come to life by showcasing examples of the outcomes achieved. This was important for demonstrating what the changes meant for customers, stakeholders and our people. We planned for and built in a significant and long-term investment in change management 62. It was and is a must to put significant time and effort into change management. Helping customers, stakeholders, partners and our people to understand what we were trying to achieve and why, and what part they needed to play, was key to having people adopt the changes introduced by transformation. We invested time in understanding each of our stakeholder groups, and completed detailed impact assessments for each release. 63. When we migrated GST to new systems and processes in February 2017, we thought we had put sufficient effort into change management and communications. However, it became clear that we were nowhere near as effective as we thought we were. As a result, we changed our approach for subsequent releases, a s well as bringing customers and stakeholders into the design process, in particular tax agents. Engagement with tax agents increased significantly from 2017 onwards. 64. We set up an account management team to improve external customer and stakeholder management following the February 2017 release. From then on, this team became the front door for external stakeholders and customers for the remainder of the 10 IR2022/217: Lessons learned during transformation \[IN CONFIDENCE\] programme. The team enabled two-way, open, honest discussion, communication and feedback, and provided early warning and identification of issues that could impact our external customers before they became widespread or critical. We recruited people with industry knowledge and credibility in these roles who had proven experience in programme delivery and balancing conflicting priorities. 65. Effective communications help to reduce resistance and increase acceptance of changes. We had a dedicated communications team for the duration of the programme, who were responsible for communications to all internal, customer and stakeholder groups. The team was responsible for both internal and external communications, to ensure that messages were consistent and timings were aligned. One of our key communications principles was that we would tell our people first. We recruited individuals into the team who could understand complex information and turn it into content each stakeholder group could relate to. 66. Communications were extensive and constantly tested and refined with feedback from our customers and our people. We used a number of mediums and channels to reach customers, including digital channels and social media, and learned and modified as we went along. 67. Comprehensive engagement and communications plans for each release were designed to reach those who were affected by the changes we were making. We repeated the same messages hundreds of times, as we expected that not everyone would understand them the first time, and that some people would be surprised by what the changes meant for them. Focus on change management for your people 68. There were two key areas in which we needed to prepare our people for change. 69. The first was ensuring that our people were ready to support customers to adopt changes as each release went live. 70. We developed comprehensive training programmes ahead of each release, to provide opportunities for hands-on experience with new systems and processes. On average, our front line people had around 3 days’ of mandatory training for each release, equating to 18 days of training overall per person. This is another area in which we adapted our approach as we went, based on feedback from our people about what was working for them and what was not. For example, after the first release in February 2017 we refined our approach and included more time for informal and on-the-job learning, more tailored practice prior to go-live, and smaller groups for classroom based training. Communications also played a key role in building understanding and awareness. The approach included open homes and workshops, deep dives and master classes. 71. The second was supporting our people through the move to our new organisation design. 72. The executive leadership team led the top-down design for the new organisation, focusing on what we expected to be doing in future, rather than what we were doing at the time. The design team was made up of a mix of people with deep knowledge of Inland Revenue, supported by change managers. 73. Moving to a new organisation design, with fewer management layers, capability-based roles, and devolved decision-making was a critical part of our transformation. Although we were open and honest with our people from a very early stage about the changes that could be made, including being a smaller organisation at the end of the programme, the change process was still hard for people. 11 IR2022/217: Lessons learned during transformation \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 74. We worked closely with unions, investing time in consultation and engagement. We also brought our union colleagues into the design process, specifically around task-based and broader roles. 75. Transformative changes are disruptive and at times emotionally traumatic for people – the soft stuff is the hard stuff. We expected that it would be hard and, a t times, it was. We were careful to value the past but focus on the future. 76. There were also other significant changes for our people during transformation, which meant they were dealing with a lot of change on a lot of different fronts. For example, we moved to new enterprise support services platform (which we named Ātea). 77. By moving to Ātea we intended to simplify, standardise and integrate our processes and automate tasks wherever possible. This would enable our people to self-serve as much as possible using digital services. While we did, for the most part, achieve this we underestimated the change management required in some areas. People across Inland Revenue are not finding the system and related processes as intuitive or simple as they expected. Support and training material has not consistently provided the assistance required to address this challenge and is an on-going area of focus for us. We understood that no matter how good our planning was, things would go wrong 78. Adopting a learning mindset was key to our success. We constantly learned from the things that did not go well. At each stage / release we paused and took stock, adapted our plans and processes and moved on. We captured what we learned in order to act and change what we were doing whenever needed. And that things would change over the life of the programme 79. While earthquakes and building closures were disruptive, the biggest impact on the programme was undoubtedly the COVID-19 pandemic. During the early part of 2020, we had to organise our people to work from home, go -live with a major release remotely, and support the Government’s response by implementing new products – all at the same time. As part of the initial COVID-19 response, we implemented the small business cashflow (loan) scheme and supported the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to administer the wage subsidy. 80. The small business cashflow (loan) scheme was implemented in 39 working days (it took just 10 days from when the Government confirmed its intentions). Once we understood the outcome Ministers were looking for, we were able to design the processes and systems to ensure they were as simple as possible, so we could maximise customer uptake and deliver within the time frame required. 81. Initially, MSD staff called us to verify income information for some wage subsidy applications. When the scheme was extended and the forecast volumes became clear, we built a portal in 15 working days to allow approved MSD people to access the information they needed to verify applications directly. MSD were involved in design sessions from the beginning, which was key to moving at speed. We developed the necessary information sharing arrangements and required training simultaneously. 82. To implement things quickly, you need to keep things simple, re-use existing design patterns wherever possible, involve relevant stakeholders, and understand where the data you need will be coming from. Transitioning to business-as-usual (2021 and 2022) 83. We set up a transition and business integration workstream to support the transition of knowledge, processes, and practices from the programme to their enduring homes in 12 IR2022/217: Lessons learned during transformation \[IN CONFIDENCE\] our new organisation design. This enabled a gradual transition of responsibility, and allowed the leads in the new organisation to focus on setting up their teams. As a result, we have successfully retained a large number of programme people and intellectual property within Inland Revenue. The benefit of hindsight 84. We did not get everything right and, with the benefit of hindsight, would have done things differently in some areas. The key areas where we made changes as a result of what we learned were: how we approached organisation design changes, and stakeholder engagement. 85. In February 2018, we made the first changes as part of the move to our new organisation design. It became clear that some parts of the process needed improvement. In July 2018, the process was reviewed independently, which led to us changing our approach. The recommendations from this review played a big part in each of the following organisation design changes. These all ran successfully, although they involved much smaller groups of people. 86. It was also clear that, at times, the rationale for the organisation design changes we were making got lost among the mechanics of the change process itself. On reflection, this area could have had more focus. 87. To ensure stakeholder engagement was as effective as possible, we should have established the account management function at the beginning of the programme. This would have helped to ensure that customer and stakeholder engagement was embedded into every part of design and delivery. 88. Initially, we relied on representative groups of stakeholders. For example, we took the view that Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) represented the views of tax intermediaries. We could have done more to seek the views of smaller tax agents and business earlier in the programme. 89. Throughout the programme, we adopted a learning mindset. We were open about the mistakes we made and focused on what could be learnt rather than on recrimination. We used lessons from the initial phases of work to reshape and improve later releases and we were open with our people and stakeholders about this. Considerations for other agencies 90. The key things we would advise other agencies embarking on transformation to have are: • Collective accountability at the executive leadership level. • Recognition that the required skills are highly unlikely to already exist in the organisation. Recruit someone with the right skills and experience whose only job is leading the transformational effort, and ensure they are supported by a team and partners with the right skills. • A clear view about what will be delivered by when, with sufficient depth and rigour to provide confidence and enough flexibility to adapt when needed. • A commitment to full funding. • Strong delivery disciplines, including scope and risk management, and tracking and reporting of progress. 13 IR2022/217: Lessons learned during transformation \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • The right level of focus on customers and change management, including stakeholder engagement and communications. • A plan to deliver the benefits: if the design doesn’t deliver the benefits, it isn’t right.

Liability for PAYE: Were the shares held on bare trust?
=======================================================

2015 case note - whether the disputant liable to pay PAYE on monthly payments - bare trusts, shareholding, s RD 3, s YB 21.

Case

TRA 022/14 \[2015\] NZTRA 22

Legislative References

Income Tax Act

### Summary

This case was about whether the disputant was liable to pay PAYE on monthly payments made to Mr X. The disputant argued that Mr X was a shareholder of the disputant and therefore the disputant was not required to return the PAYE owing as the monthly payments were not PAYE income payments to Mr X. Deciding whether Mr X was a shareholder of the disputant turned on whether Mr A (sole registered shareholder of the disputant) held shares in the disputant for Mr X on bare trust.

### Impact

In determining whether a bare trust exists, the Taxation Review Authority ("the Authority") looked into the powers and obligations of the person who claimed to be a bare trustee. In this case, Mr A's powers to transfer the property exceeded those of a bare trustee. Mr A also did not consider himself to be under any obligation to transfer the property when asked to do so.

### Facts

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) assessed the disputant for PAYE for 38 periods between February 2007 and March 2010 on the basis that the disputant failed to account to the Commissioner for PAYE from monthly payments (“the Monthly Payments”) made to Mr X.

The disputant contended that the Monthly Payments were not subject to PAYE as Mr X was a shareholder-employee. Mr X was not a registered shareholder of the disputant (Mr A was the registered shareholder of all the shares). However, the disputant asserted that Mr X held a 30% shareholding with the disputant as a beneficiary by way of a bare trust arrangement, with Mr A holding the shares on a bare trust.

### Decision

The two issues for determination by the Authority were whether Mr A held the shares as a bare trustee on trust for Mr X and, if so, whether the Monthly Payments made to Mr X were excluded from being taxable under s RD 3(2) of the Income Tax Act (“ITA”).

There was no dispute between the parties as to the relevant law.

Section RA 5 of the ITA requires employers to withhold tax and pay PAYE. Section RD 3(1)(b)(ii) provides that the PAYE rules apply to a PAYE income payment which does not include an amount to a shareholder-employee in the circumstances set out in s RD3(2). Section YB 21(1) of the ITA states that if a person holds or does something as a nominee for another, the other person is to be treated as holding or doing that thing and the nominee is ignored. Section YB 21(2) of the ITA provides that a trustee is only a nominee if the trustee is a bare trustee.

Judge Sinclair, in considering the meaning of a bare trustee, referred to Halsbury’s Law of England (5th ed, vol 98 at 195) which stated:

*   … A bare trustee has been defined as a person who has himself no present beneficial interest in it and no duties to perform in respect of it except to convey and transfer it to persons entitled to hold it, and he is bound to convey or transfer the property accordingly when required to do so.

She also referred to _Hedergen v Federal Commissioner of Taxation_ (1998) 84 ALR 271 at 281, in which Gummow J distinguished between passive and active trusts and _Burns v Steel_ \[2006\] 1 NZLR 559 at \[62\], in which Randerson J observed that it is not enough that the description of “bare trustee” is used.

Judge Sinclair moved on to consider the requirements to create a valid express trust: certainty of intention, certainty of subject matter and certainty of object.

**_Issue 1: Were the shares held in the disputant pursuant to a bare trust?_**

Judge Sinclair first considered the Deed of Declaration of Trust dated 21 December 2006 that Mr A executed and which provided:

*   The Trustee shall at all times deal with all matters at the direction of \[Mr A\] and shall when called upon or when the Trustee so wishes whichever shall be the earlier transfer the shareholding of the Company…

Judge Sinclair found that Mr A as trustee was not acting simply as a bare trustee for Mr X but had powers to transfer the property which exceeded those of a bare trustee. Mr A as trustee had power to “deal with all matters” at the direction of himself and retained the power to transfer the shares at his own discretion without any demand from the beneficiaries.

Judge Sinclair noted that the Deed of Trust referred to the disputant as “to be incorporated” and then considered the issue around “certainty of subject matter”. The shares described in the Deed of Trust were B class shares but the shares issued by the disputant were all ordinary shares. Judge Sinclair did not consider that it can be said that the shares described in the Deed of Trust are clearly identifiable as those subsequently issued by the disputant.

Judge Sinclair also referred to Mr A’s evidence that Mr X gave valuable consideration for the creation of the trust and the submissions that the Deed of Trust formed part of the consideration (which was described as being part of the oral agreement reached by Mr A and Mr X in 2006). Judge Sinclair was not satisfied that there was any oral agreement pursuant to which Mr X waived his rights under a Heads of Agreement dated 9 January 2006 and noted that there is no evidence that Mr X agreed to the shares being held on trust or had knowledge of the existence of the Deed of Trust.

Judge Sinclair did not accept the disputant’s contention that while Mr A had been in breach of his duty as trustee in not transferring the shares, this did not mean that he was not holding the shares as a bare trustee pursuant to the Deed of Trust, and found that Mr A is not a bare trustee under the Deed of Trust or, in the alternative, the Deed of Trust is not valid and enforceable.

Having considered the communication between Mr A, Mr X and their advisors and Mr A’s affidavit (sworn on 25 January 2011 in support of a notice of opposition to Mr X’s originating application to rectify the share register) in which Mr A states that the transfer was conditional on an appropriate mechanism being finalised dealing with the control of the companies and protection of the shareholders, the Authority was not satisfied that Mr A held the shares on trust for Mr X as a bare trustee.

As Mr A was not holding the shares in the disputant as a bare trustee, s YB21 of the ITA cannot apply to deem Mr X to be a shareholder of the disputant. As a result, the amounts paid to Mr X were PAYE income payments under s RD 3(2)(b)(ii).

As Judge Sinclair found that Mr A was not holding the shares as a bare trust, it was not necessary to consider the second issue.

The Authority dismissed the challenge and confirmed the Commissioner’s assessments.

Ngā mātua e haepapa ana whai nama tautoko tamaiti Liable parents with child support debt
========================================================================================

There are a few reasons a payment from a [liable parent](/api/glossary/item?id={2BD1C350-B91A-4EA6-A784-C7C311502E33})
 to a [receiving carer](/api/glossary/item?id={ECAE3AEF-DAB7-4A41-BB04-B4E94EFA1B55})
 may be overdue. It may be because:

*   the payment was late or not made at all
*   the assessment changed
*   there was a change in your details and we were not told.

If you are the liable parent, you'll need to sort out any child support debt as soon as possible. If you cannot pay in full, let us know how much you can pay. You can either send us a message in your myIR account or call us to make an arrangement.

If you do not contact us, we may take action to collect the overdue amounts.

[Update my child support details](/child-support/managing/details/update)

[Child support - contact us](/contactus/child-support)

Late payment penalties
----------------------

If your child support is not paid in full and on time, penalties are charged on the outstanding amount. Late payment penalties are charged on all overdue child support payments.

From 1 November, penalties are charged at:

*   2% of the unpaid child support, the day after the due date
*   8% of the unpaid child support 28 days after the due date.

### Grace period

There is a 60-day grace period during which we do not charge any late payment penalties. The grace period applies when:

*   you are first made liable to pay child support
*   you start to pay child support after a period of being a receiving carer
*   you are assessed to pay child support again after a period of being out of child support.

The grace period of 60-days starts on your first due date. This is to give you time to organise your payments. Although we will not charge penalties in this period, we will still take action to collect any missed payments.

### Ongoing monthly late payment penalties

From 1 April 2021, we stopped charging the ongoing monthly late payment penalties to overdue child support. Child support you owe from before this date may have had these penalties applied.

We may be able to reduce or remove the penalties if you pay the overdue child support or set up a payment plan. Contact us to find out how we can help with penalties.

Setting up a payment plan
-------------------------

If you cannot pay all your overdue child support at once, payment plans can make things easier. I If you are paying your child support by deductions from your income, contact us to work out a payment plan and we will include this as a deduction from your income. If you do not contact us, we may increase your deductions to cover the debt.

If you are making your payments yourself and you fall behind, you can set up a payment plan by calling us or letting us know how much you can repay by completing a Manual payer schedule in myIR.

[Set up a child support payment plan](/child-support/managing/making-payments/set-up-a-child-support-payment-plan)

Collecting overdue child support
--------------------------------

If you do not arrange to pay your debt, we may deduct your child support from:

*   salary or wages - up to 40% of your net income
*   benefit payments
*   ACC payments
*   bank accounts - the available balance on each account
*   any other money that may be payable to you, for example, a trust account or superannuation payout.

If you have a tax refund owing, we'll use this to pay your child support debt, even if you have a payment plan with us.

If you live in Australia, we may request Services Australia collect payments on our behalf. If you live in a country that has joined the [2007 Child Support Convention](/api/glossary/item?id={389FC8B1-8B62-4A99-9627-DCF293805298})
, we may ask an overseas authority to collect payments on our behalf. We can also take legal action against you, such as restricting overseas travel.

We'll always try to agree on a payment plan with you before taking any legal action.

Keeping your child support up to date
-------------------------------------

If you pay child support, you must:

*   keep your contact details with us up to date
*   tell us about any changes to your income or care arrangements as soon as you can
*   keep up with payments
*   sort any overdue payments as soon as possible
*   let us know if your payment plan is not working.

[Taxation (savings investment and miscellaneous provisions) Act 2006 and Taxation (annual rates of income tax 2006-07) Act 2006](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-savings-investment-and-miscellaneous-provisions-act-2006-and-taxation-annual-rates-of-incom "Taxation (savings investment and miscellaneous provisions) Act 2006 and Taxation (annual rates of income tax 2006-07) Act 2006")

Limit on refunds and allocations of tax
=======================================

2006 amendment to the imputation rules extends the circumstances when tax overpaid before a breach in shareholder continuity can be refunded.

##### Sections MD 2(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2004

The imputation rules have been amended to extend the circumstances when tax overpaid before a breach in shareholder continuity can be refunded. The amendment corrects an anomaly in the previous rules.

### Background

Generally, overpaid company tax cannot be refunded if a refund would result in a debit balance to the company's imputation credit account (ICA).

Under section ME 5(1)(i), a breach of shareholder continuity in a company results in a debit arising to the ICA at the time of the breach. Although a "discontinuity" debit can effectively be ignored for the purposes of effecting the refund, there is a condition that the debit must arise after "the date of payment of the first instalment of provisional tax" for the year to which the overpayment applied.

Where a company does not pay provisional tax - for example, because its income tax liability is satisfied instead by resident withholding tax deducted from interest - there is no "date of payment of the first instalment of provisional tax". Therefore no adjustment can be made to the ICA balance under current law in relation to the overpayment that arose before a breach in continuity.

The anomaly has only recently been identified, although it has existed since the imputation rules were introduced. Inland Revenue is aware of only one case affected by it.

### Key features

Section MD 2(4) of the 1994 and 2004 Income Tax Acts, which effectively allows an imputation account debit that arises on a breach of shareholder continuity to be ignored for the purpose of calculating a tax refund, has been amended to ensure that it operates correctly, whether the overpayment of tax was made before or after the first instalment of provisional tax.

### Application date

The amendment applies from the 2000-2001 year. This date is arbitrary. It was chosen because it will ensure that the correct tax treatment is applied to the only case identified so far as affected by the anomaly.

Te honohono pūkete kiritaki Linking client accounts
===================================================

Intermediaries can link to clients’ myIR accounts. Once linked, they can act on behalf of their clients for certain tax types.

Customers need an active account (tax) type
-------------------------------------------

If a client does not have an active account (such as income tax) they'll need to register for one in myIR. If this is not possible, send us a message in myIR to request we open an account for the client. In your message include:

*   the account type that needs to be opened
*   the reason the account is needed
*   confirmation that you hold an authority to act
*   a request that the client is linked to your agency.

Customers can have more than 1 intermediary acting on their behalf
------------------------------------------------------------------

A customer can have many intermediaries acting on their behalf. However, they cannot have more than 1 intermediary of the same type linked to the same account at any time.

For example, a client can have a tax agent, bookkeeper and other representative linked to income tax at the same time. But a client cannot have a tax agent and 2 bookkeepers linked to income tax at the same time.

Getting approval to link
------------------------

All intermediaries need written authority from clients before they can link. Once a client has given authority, you can link to their account in myIR.

After linking, access to client accounts will be automatic for tax agents, bookkeepers and PAYE intermediaries.

Payroll bureaus and other representatives do not get automatic access. These intermediaries need to let us know when they want to link to a client. We will send the client an email or letter to approve the request.

What intermediaries can do
--------------------------

Tax agents can:

*   choose where client mail and refunds are sent to
*   link to a customer master link that gives access to a client’s customer level mail.

Bookkeepers and other representatives can link to the same account types as a tax agent but cannot choose where client mail is sent.

PAYE intermediaries can only link to the payroll account. Client mail is automatically sent to the intermediary.

Payroll bureaus can only link to the payroll account and mail cannot be directed away from the client’s address.

Account types that cannot be linked
-----------------------------------

You cannot link clients for the following account types:

*   Child support – liable parent
*   Child support – receiving carer
*   FamilyBoost
*   KiwiSaver voluntary contributions.

Your client needs to nominate you to act on their behalf for these account types.

Liquidation triggers statutory set-off; set-off not a "transaction" for the purposes of the voidable transaction provisions
===========================================================================================================================

2013 case note – liquidation triggered a statutory set-off, and liquidator's application for orders that the set-off was a voidable transaction were declined.

Case

David Harlock v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2013\] NZHC 3389

Legislative References

Companies Act 1993, Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary

At the date of liquidation, Raiz Enterprises Ltd ("the company") owed outstanding pay as you earn ("PAYE") and goods and services tax ("GST"), but was owed a refund for overpaid withholding tax. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") set off the refund against the amount owed. The liquidator's application for orders that the set-off was a voidable transaction was declined.

### Impact of decision

There are no implications arising from this judgment.

### Facts

This decision relates to an application for orders under section 295 of the Companies Act 1993 ("the CA") that the set-off of an income tax refund against outstanding PAYE and GST was a "voidable transaction" for the purposes of section 292 of the CA.

The applicant, David Harlock, was the liquidator of the company. The Commissioner claimed that when the company ceased business it owed her the sum of $77,055.51 for unpaid PAYE and $179,264.27 for unpaid GST, a total of $256,319.78.

On 22 May 2013, prior to the company going into liquidation, it filed its income tax return for the 2013 year. The return gave rise to an income tax refund of $98,998.88. The company offered the refund as part of a payment proposal to pay its outstanding arrears over time.

On 28 May 2013, the Commissioner declined the payment proposal but advised the company's accountant that the refund would be set off against the arrears.

However, the refund was not transferred until 18 June 2013, after the Commissioner received legal advice about the transfer on 12 June 2013.

By then the company had been placed into voluntary liquidation (on 5 June 2013).

On 25 July 2013, the applicant issued a voidable notice. The Commissioner did not respond to the voidable notice within the statutory timeframe, or at all. Pursuant to section 294(3) of the CA, a voidable transaction is automatically set aside if a voidable notice is not responded to within the statutory timeframe.

On 25 September 2013, the applicant filed these proceedings to enforce payment of the voidable notice.

### Decision

#### Section 292

The parties were not able to agree about the circumstances in which the Commissioner applied the refund. The applicant argued that the offer of the refund as part of the payment proposal amounted to a "request" pursuant to section RM 10(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("the ITA") so the set-off was, therefore, a "transaction" between the company and the Commissioner. The Commissioner argued that the set-off was a unilateral action, which did not constitute a "transaction" as defined in the ITA.

The Court found that there was no evidence to suggest that the set-off was carried out at the request of the company, noting that the payment proposal had been declined (_Harlock v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2013\] NZHC 3389, at \[35\]). The Court concluded that the set-off was not a voidable transaction that was caught by section 292 because it did not literally fall within the description of a transaction. That was because it took place after the end of the specified period (at \[38\]).

The Court also noted that section 292 referred to transactions "by the company", which suggested that the expression did not extend to unilateral actions or decisions of third parties which the company did not participate in. In addition, the definition was phrased as meaning specific categories of transactions, which did not include being subjected to a set-off under the taxation legislation (at \[41\]).

Further, there was persuasive authority of the Court of Appeal that a set-off is not a transaction to which section 292 applies (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Smith_ \[2000\] 2 NZLR 147 (CA)).

The Court also rejected the applicant's submission that amounts due to be refunded under section RM 2 of the ITA were held in trust by the Commissioner pending payment (at \[51\]).

The Court later went on to consider whether the operation of section 294 of the CA (which automatically voids a transaction if a voidable notice is not responded to within the statutory timeframe) prevented the Commissioner from arguing that the set-off was not a "transaction".

The Court found that the giving of a notice under section 294 was not sufficient to deem what would otherwise not be a "transaction" under section 292, to be such (at \[72\]). Therefore, section 294 did not prevent the Commissioner from arguing that the set-off was not a transaction.

#### Section 310

The Court suggested that the liquidation of the company triggered the operability of section 310 of the CA as the statutory authority for the set-off, rather than section RM 10 of the ITA (at \[62\]). The Court observed that the Commissioner is subject to the provisions of the CA just as any other individual is (at \[63\]).

Noting that section 310 takes effect upon the liquidation of a company, the Court stated (at \[68\]):

*   Therefore it was the statutory and automatic netting that took effect with the commencement of liquidation on 5 June 2013 rather than the account that the respondent stated on 18 June 2013 which was of crucial effect. That conclusion must mean that any entitlement that the Commissioner had to the $99,000 approximately was not referable to a transaction which breached section 292 CA …

**Requirement of a preference**

Given the conclusion above that the set-off was not a "transaction" within section 292 of the CA, the Court was not required to determine this issue. However, it noted that a "reasonably complex calculation" would need to have been carried out to determine the matter (at \[76\]).

Listed industrial mineral mining
================================

From 2014 the concessionary rules that applied to 'specified mineral' miners (now known as 'listed industrial minerals') have largely been repealed and replaced.

#### _Subpart CU, section CZ 28, subpart DU, sections EJ 20B to EJ 20E, FM 31(2)(b), GB 20, IA 7, ID 1, IS 1, IS 2, IS 6, subpart LU and section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

The concessionary rules that previously applied to "specified mineral" miners (now known as "listed industrial minerals") have largely been repealed and replaced with rules that more closely align the tax treatment of these miners with that of taxpayers more generally, while accommodating some of the more unique aspects of the mineral mining industry.

### Key features

The key features of the new rules relate to the deductibility of expenditure. The rules separate a mine's life into various phases and allow deductions based on the phase in which the expenditure occurs. In essence, the rules treat mines as large revenue account projects and seek to ensure that the allocation of income and deductions is broadly in line with orthodox tax principles.

Concessionary rules that allow the losses of mining companies to survive a breach in shareholder continuity have been retained. However, these concessions are buttressed by rules that limit the ability of mining companies to form consolidated groups and offset mining losses.

A refundable credit has been created to recognise that certain types of expenditure are likely to result in deductions being available only after the income-earning activity of a miner has ceased.

### Application date

The changes apply from the 2014-15 income year.

Detailed analysis
-----------------

### Who the rules apply to

The rules will apply to all "mineral miners". Because the new rules are less concessionary, it is expected that miners will adopt different structures to carry out their operations. The definition of "mineral miner" in section CU 6 therefore applies to all forms of legal entity:

*   whose only or main source of income is the mining of a listed industrial mineral in New Zealand; or
*   whose only or main activity is:
    *   exploring, searching or mining for a listed industrial mineral in New Zealand; or
    *   performing development work for exploring, searching or mining for a listed industrial mineral in New Zealand; or
*   who proposes that their only or main activity is as set out in the previous point.

The relevant sources of income or activities are unchanged from the previous rules. To ensure consistency, the new rules also largely retain the previous definitions of "mining operations" and "associated mining operations" in section CU 7. The definition of "listed industrial minerals" in section CU 8 is identical to the previous definition of "specified minerals".

A miner does not include a person that engages in the relevant activity only as a service for reward, unless the reward is wholly or mainly dependent on the production of minerals or wholly or mainly arises through participation in profits from the mining operations. This is to exclude "ordinary" contractors who are not in some sort of profit-sharing arrangement as part of the mining activities.

Section CU 5 clarifies that if mining is carried out through a partnership, each partner is treated as having a share or interest to the extent of their interest in the income in the partnership. The rules related to income and deductibility of expenditure apply according to those shares.

### Income

Under these rules, a mineral miner can derive income from four main sources:

*   Under section CU 1, amounts derived from their "mining operations" or "associated mining operations".
*   Under section CU 2, amounts derived from the disposal of land. The land in question must be acquired for the purposes of current or intended mining operations and must either:
    *   constitute a mining permit area, or be adjacent to it; or
    *   be part of a mining permit area, or be adjacent to it.

*   This is intended to ensure that only land directly relevant to the mining activity is captured by the new rules, rather than other land interests that a mineral miner may have (such as an office building in a nearby town).

*   Under section CU 3, consideration derived from disposing of a mineral mining asset. "Mineral mining asset" is defined in section CU 9 to mean a mining or prospecting right, an exploration permit, a prospecting permit or a mining permit or any share or interest in any of these assets.
*   Under section CU 4, amounts recovered under a special "claw-back" rule that applies if deductions are taken when, in hindsight, those deductions should not have been taken immediately, but spread over the life of the mine. For this rule to apply, the following criteria must be met:
    *   The miner must incur "exploration expenditure" (discussed below), for which they are allowed a deduction under section DU 1(1)(b).
    *   The income year in question must be after the 2013-14 income year (to avoid retrospective application of the claw-back rule).
    *   The expenditure must have been incurred in a year for which the miner is required to keep records under section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (to avoid imposing additional compliance costs on a miner by making them keep records for longer than they would otherwise need to for tax purposes).
    *   The expenditure results in, produces or generates an asset for the miner that they then use for, or in relation to, the commercial production of minerals.

The previous specified mineral rules allowed a mineral miner to provision for future anticipated expenditure – a concessionary feature that has not been carried over into the new rules. This means miners that have these provisions will need to add them back as income in the 2014-15 income year, being the year the new rules take effect. This may result in some miners having an unexpectedly large income tax liability in that year. To ease any cashflow concerns that may arise, section CZ 28 allows a miner to allocate this income equally over the 2014-15 and 2015-16 income years.

### Deductions

The special deduction rules are set out in subpart DU. These rules break mining activity down into its main phases and allow deductions broadly in accordance with orthodox tax principles.

The main phases, and types of expenditure, are:

*   Prospecting expenditure
*   Exploration expenditure
*   Development expenditure
*   Operational expenditure
*   Rehabilitation expenditure
*   Land expenditure.

The definitions of these types of expenditure are mutually exclusive, so expenditure can only fall into one category.

Also excluded is "residual expenditure", for which deductions are allowed under ordinary principles. Residual expenditure" is expenditure:

*   for which the miner is allowed a deduction under section DB 33 (Scientific research);
*   on an application fee payable to the Crown for a permit;
*   on insurance premiums or royalties paid under the Petroleum Act 1937 or the Crown Mineral Act 1991, land tax under the Land Tax Act 1976, or rates;
*   on a lease of land or buildings;
*   on a financial arrangement to which the old financial arrangement rules apply; or
*   on interest.

#### _Prospecting expenditure_

Under section DU 1, mining prospecting expenditure is always deductible. "Mining prospecting expenditure" is defined in section DU 9 as expenditure that a miner incurs directly in relation to the acquisition of a prospecting right under the Crown Minerals Act or "mining prospecting information". It also includes prospecting activities undertaken through various methods, but does not include land, plant or machinery costs, which must be treated under ordinary principles.

#### _Exploration expenditure_

Mining exploration expenditure is also immediately deductible under section DU 1. However, this is subject to the "claw-back" rule in section CU 4, discussed above. Expenditure clawed back under that rule is subject to the spreading rules that apply to development expenditure, discussed below.

"Mining exploration expenditure" is defined in section DU 10 to mean expenditure incurred in searching or exploring in New Zealand for a listed industrial mineral. It includes expenditure incurred directly in relation to:

*   acquiring an exploration right or permit under the Crown Minerals Act;
*   geological mapping and geophysical surveys;
*   systematic searches for areas containing minerals; or
*   searching by drilling or other techniques.

Again, expenditure on land, plant and machinery is excluded.

#### _Development expenditure_

"Mining development expenditure" is defined in section DU 11. This type of expenditure is generally capitalised and then deducted over the life of the mine. This treatment approximates the depreciation rules that generally apply to capital assets. For these purposes "development expenditure" includes exploration expenditure that has been clawed back under section CU 4.

#### _Definition_

"Mining development expenditure" is defined as expenditure that a miner incurs in preparing a permit area for mining and expenditure on operations carried on by a miner on a permit area for the purposes of deriving income and consists of:

*   mining;
*   performing work directly related to mining; or
*   undertaking earthworks necessary for the working of the mine.

The definition also specifically includes the following:

*   acquiring a mining right or permit under the Crown Minerals Act;
*   obtaining resource consents;
*   establishing mine infrastructure (including plant and machinery, production equipment or facilities, or storage facilities); and
*   providing communication equipment, fuel, light, power or water in relation to their mining operations in a permit area.

This definition is deliberately broad to capture all expenditure that is conceptually part of the creation of the capital asset – in this case a mine. However, it has the potential to overreach and capture expenditure that is properly operational in nature. This is particularly so for expenditure incurred after commercial production of the mine has begun. The definition therefore specifically excludes the following:

*   "operational expenditure" (discussed below); and
*   other expenditure that is incurred on property after the start of commercial production and that has an estimated useful life that does not depend on the remaining assumed life of the mine. An example might be a digger acquired after commercial production has begun to shift rock for mining purposes. That digger could, if the mine closed, be used for other purposes. Its useful life as a digger is not dependent on the particular mine in question. It is therefore not "development expenditure" and can be depreciated at the appropriate rate for that type of digger.

The definition of "operational expenditure" in section DU 11(4) expands and clarifies this second limb of excluded "development expenditure". "Operational expenditure" means expenditure that meets the following criteria:

*   it is incurred in operations by the miner in a permit area;
*   it is incurred after the start of commercial production; and
*   it does not create an asset that has an estimated useful life of longer than one year.

This is designed to clarify that "running costs" of the mine, such as administrative costs incurred after the start of production, are not required to be capitalised. They can instead be treated in accordance with ordinary taxation principles.

#### _Spreading methods_

Sections DU 6 and DU 7 set out the two spreading methods that may be available to a miner in respect of their development expenditure. One is time based and the other operates on a "reserve depletion" basis (sometimes referred to as a "unit of production" basis).

Under either method deductions are denied except to the extent allowed under the spreading rules (sections DU 6(2) and DU 7(2)).

#### _Reserve depletion_

The reserve depletion method is available only to miners that either:

*   use IFRS rules to prepare their financial statements; or
*   keep records that are sufficient for the Commissioner to verify their calculations.

The miner must also make an irrevocable election in the first year of commercial production from a permit area to apply the reserve depletion method (sections DU 7(1)(d) and EJ 20E(2)). To transition into the new rules, section EJ 20E(7) allows an existing miner to make this irrevocable election in the 2014-15 income year.

Deductions under the reserve depletion method are only available after the miner starts to use the permit area to derive income (section DU 7(1)(b)). The deductions are then spread according to the rules set out in section EJ 20E – in particular, the formula set out in subsection (3).

That formula is:

(reserve expenditure \- previous expenditure) x (reserve depletion for the year ÷ proven and probable reserves)

"Reserve expenditure" is the total development expenditure for the current and previous income years (in effect, all development expenditure).

"Previous expenditure" is the expenditure that has been allocated to earlier income years.

"Reserve depletion for the year" is the amount of mineral produced in the year.

"Proven and probable reserves" are the proven and probable reserves set out in the reserve statement for the area, provided the reserve statement is prepared in accordance with a classification recognised under the Crown Minerals (Mineral other than Petroleum) Regulations 2007.

For the purposes of "reserve depletion" and "proven and probable reserves" the amount must be set out using an appropriate unit of measure (as set out in the reserve statement) and used consistently.

A simple example of how the formula might work is shown below.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| Miner A is in year 3 of commercial production of a permit area and its total development expenditure to date has been $50 million. In the previous two years, Miner A has deducted $10 million under the reserve depletion method. The latest reserve statement estimates that 1,000 proven and probable units of the mineral remain in the permit area. In year 3, Miner A produces 250 units.<br><br>Using the formula, Miner A will be allowed a deduction in year 3 of:<br><br>($50m \- $10m) x (250 ÷ 1,000)<br><br>$40 x 0.25 = $10m |     |

To recognise that sometimes expenses might be allocated on the basis of a "mine" rather than a permit area, section EJ 20E(6) allows a miner to allocate expenditure to a mine – but only if the miner:

*   uses International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) rules to prepare their financial statements; and
*   allocation to a mine is permitted for the purposes of those statements.

**Time basis**

The time basis of allocating development expenditure is the default method for miners that either do not qualify to elect into the reserve depletion method (for example, if they do not keep the requisite records) or they do meet the criteria but fail to, or chose not to, elect.

As with the reserve depletion method, deductions under this method are only available after the miner starts to use the permit area to derive income (section DU 6(1)(b)). The spreading rule is set out in section EJ 20B to EJ 20D.

The calculation formula is set out in section EJ 20B(2) as:

rate x value

"Rate" is, at the choice of the miner:

*   the straight-line rate set out in schedule 12, column 2 that is nearest to the rate calculated under section EJ 20D(2) (discussed below); or
*   the diminishing value rate set out in schedule 12, column 1 that corresponds with the straight-line rate in the point above.

"Value" is the adjusted tax value or diminished value of the expenditure (as appropriate).

Whether the miner is using the straight line or diminishing value method, the following formula in section EJ 20D is needed to determine the appropriate rate.

100% ÷ assumed life

The assumed life is the lesser of:

*   the period that the miner uses for accounting purposes as the amortisation period for the area or, if the miner is not required to use an amortisation period for their accounts, the commercial production period for the area that miner reasonably estimates; and
*   25 years from the later of the date that commercial production starts or the date that the expenditure is incurred.

This rule effectively puts a 25-year cap on the amortisation period for development expenditure under this method.

For these purposes, the expected life of the mine must be reassessed at the end of each year, to determine whether the previous estimate is still accurate.

Section EJ 20C sets out the length of the spreading period. It starts on the later of the first day in the income year that commercial production commences and the first day of the income year that the expenditure is incurred. It finishes on the last day of the income year in which the expiry of the assumed life of the mine occurs.

A simple example of how this rule works is shown below.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| Miner B is in year 1 of commercial production and has incurred $50,000 in development expenditure on the permit area. Miner B is not required to use an amortisation period for its accounts. Using the information at its disposal, Miner B considers that it will be commercially producing minerals from the site for 3 years. Miner B wants to use a straight-line depreciation method.<br><br>Using the formula:<br><br>100% ÷ assumed life<br><br>Miner B must calculate the depreciation rate in schedule 12 using the rate closest to 33.33%. The closest rate in the schedule is 30%.<br><br>Using the formula in EJ 20B: rate x value<br><br>Miner B's deduction in year 1 is: 30% x $50,000 = $15,000 |     |

Again, this method allows a miner to allocate expenditure to a mine, rather than a permit area if the criteria described in the "reserve depletion" section above are met (section EJ 20B(b)).

**Tax credit**

A tax credit may be available in some instances for "trapped" development expenditure (which may arise using either spreading method) – see the section on tax credits, below.

### Operational expenditure

As set out above, "operational expenditure" is essentially an exclusion from the "mining development expenditure" definition. There are no specific rules related to such expenditure, so general principles apply to determine its deductibility or otherwise.

### Rehabilitation expenditure

"Rehabilitation expenditure" is deductible in the year it is incurred (section DU 2).

The term is defined in section DU 12 to mean expenditure incurred in New Zealand directly in relation to rehabilitation of land in a permit area, carried out as a result of:

*   permit requirements;
*   the requirements of access arrangements under the Crown Minerals Act 1991 or regulations made under that Act;
*   a miner's obligation under the Resource Management Act 1991 or regulations under that Act;
*   a concession under the Conservation Act 1987; or
*   an authority under the Historic Places Act 1993.

The definition also clarifies that rehabilitation expenditure can be incurred either during or after the operational phase of mining.

#### _Tax credit_

To recognise the fact that rehabilitation expenditure (though deductible) may only be incurred in years after the miner's income-earning activities have ceased, a tax credit may be available in some instances. The section on tax credits later in this report sets out the criteria.

### Land expenditure

As mentioned in the section on income from land sales and section CU 2 above, a miner's income includes amounts derived from the disposal of land. However, that section only applies if the land in question was acquired for the purposes of current or intended mining operations and either:

*   constitutes a mining permit area, or is adjacent to it; or
*   is part of a mining permit area, or is adjacent to it.

Section DU 3 contains the corresponding deduction provision. It broadly applies to the same categories of land, to provide symmetry between the income and deduction rules. It does not cover land expenditure for which the miner has a deduction before disposing of the land. This is most likely to occur if the miner has a deduction under one of the other provisions of the Act that allow for land acquisition costs to be deductible.

Land expenditure covered by section DU 3 is deductible in the year the land or interest in land is disposed of. This broadly provides for land to be treated as revenue account property, with a deduction available if a loss is made on disposal and any gains form part of the miner's income.

#### _Tax credit_

Land interests may be one of the last things a miner disposes of. To recognise that any losses incurred on sale may therefore be incurred after the income-earning activity has ceased, a tax credit may be available. The section on tax credits later in this report sets out the criteria.

### Mining asset expenditure

Mining asset expenditure is separately provided for in the legislation, although it is not as easily categorised as a "phase" in the same way as the expenditure types described above. As mentioned above, section CU 3 treats consideration derived from disposing of a mineral mining asset as income of the miner.

Section DU 4 sets out how the acquisition cost is treated. If a mining permit for the relevant permit area has not been obtained, the purchaser is allowed an immediate deduction for the expenditure. This reflects the fact that any expenses incurred by the seller at that point were probably deductible as well, either as prospecting or exploration expenditure. If a mining permit has been obtained, the purchaser must treat the expenditure as mining development expenditure, so it is deductible over the life of the mine. The fact that a mining permit has been obtained indicates that the decision has been made to attempt commercial production, so the "development" phase will have started.

Section DU 4(3) clarifies that "expenditure incurred" on a mining asset does not include the cost of applying for a mining right or permit – it is only the purchase of those assets after they have been granted.

### Farm-out arrangements

A "farm-out arrangement" is defined in section YA 1 and has been modified so it applies to a mineral mining context. In simple terms, a farm-out arrangement is one where a person (the farm-in party) agrees to incur expenditure in doing work in a permit area and, in return, the existing permit holder (the farm-out party) agrees to surrender part of their interest in that permit.

Section DU 5 clarifies that expenditure by the farm-in party is to be treated as if it were the applicable class of mining expenditure. If, for example, the expenditure was classified as development expenditure, the farm-in party would only be allowed a deduction for that amount over the life of the relevant mine using the appropriate spreading method. As the existing rights holder is not getting any money from the farm-out arrangement, the expenditure of the farm-in party is excluded income to the farm-out party under section CX 43 (which overrides section CU 3 in these circumstances).

This can be contrasted with the situation when the existing permit holder sells an interest in the permit outright – in which case section CU 3 will apply to treat the proceeds as income.

### Anti-avoidance rules

Section GB 20 contained the existing specific anti-avoidance rules that applied to the petroleum mining sector. Because the phases of both mineral and petroleum mining are broadly comparable, and these new rules more closely align the tax treatment of these sectors, the anti-avoidance rules have been expanded to cover the activities of mineral miners too.

### Tax credits

As mentioned above, the new rules provide instances where miners may be entitled to deductions, but will be unable to use them because their income-earning activity has ceased. This can occur, for example, when a miner incurs rehabilitation expenditure. To recognise the undesirability of this type of "black-hole" expenditure, subpart LU creates a refundable credit that will be available if the following criteria are met (section LU 1):

*   the expenditure is of a certain type (set out below); and
*   the mineral miner has a net mining loss for the permit area for the income year that is greater than the net income of the mineral miner for the income year from all other sources. For these purposes, the net mining loss is calculated as if the miner's only income was derived from the permit area. The net income from other sources is calculated as if there were no income from the permit area. This avoids double counting of the relevant income. The difference between these figures is called the "excess amount".

The types of expenditure are:

*   rehabilitation expenditure;
*   a loss on the disposal of mining land;
*   development expenditure for which a deduction has not been available and the relevant permit has been relinquished, revoked, surrendered or has expired and the miner has no existing privilege for the permit area.

The amount of the credit reflects the fact that the credit is intended as the economic equivalent of a loss carry-back rule. It is calculated using the following formula:

expenditure or loss x tax rate

"Expenditure or loss" means the "excess amount" referred to above, but only to the extent that it includes one of the relevant expenditure types. This means the "excess amount" is an effective cap on the amount but may not always be able to be used. For example, if there is an excess amount of $100,000 but the relevant categories of expenditure only amounted to $50,000, it is the $50,000 figure that would be the basis of the calculation. Equally, if the excess amount was $100,000 but the relevant categories of expenditure amounted to $150,000, it is the $100,000 that would be used for the calculation.

"Tax rate" is the relevant basic rate of income tax set out in schedule 1, part A of the Income Tax Act 2007.

#### _Cap on credit_

To reflect its equivalence to a loss carry-back rule, section LU 1(4) provides that the credit is capped at the lesser of:

*   the result of the formula; and
*   the total amount of income tax paid by the miner in all previous tax years to the extent that it relates to the permit area.

#### _Trustees and individuals_

If a simple tax rate to calculate the tax credit was used (for example, the company rate), this may result in inappropriately high or low credits being available to miners that are individuals or trustees of a trust.

For individuals, the amount of tax paid in previous years is calculated on a year-by-year basis and aggregated as if their only income from previous years was mining income from the permit area.

For trustees, the amount of tax paid in previous years is calculated on a year-by-year basis and aggregated:

*   first, by reference to the amount of income tax paid as an agent of a beneficiary under section HC 32; and
*   second, by reference to the amount of tax paid as trustee income.

The following examples illustrate these rules.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example | **Individual** |
| Dave is a "mineral miner" who is also employed as an accountant. In each of years 1, 2 and 3, Dave earned taxable income of $90,000 in total from his mining activities and $70,000 from his job. At the end of year 3, Dave's mining activity ceases and in year 3 Dave incurs $250,000 of rehabilitation expenditure and derives no other income.<br><br>Because the $250,000 is rehabilitation expenditure, Dave is entitled to a tax credit, calculated by looking back at the total tax paid in the previous years. The first year to consider is year 3. Dave derived $90,000 in taxable income from mining that year (his salary income from his accounting job is not counted for these purposes and the $90,000 is treated as the first income he earned in that year). Dave's tax liability on that $90,000 was $20,620.<br><br>Dave still has $160,000 of rehabilitation expenditure that has not been offset, so that is carried back to year 2. Dave's $90,000 of taxable mining income from that year again produced a tax liability of $20,620.<br><br>Finally, Dave carries back the remaining $70,000 to year 1. The tax on his first $70,000 in that year is $14,020.<br><br>Dave's total tax credit on his $250,000 rehabilitation expenditure is $20,620 + $20,620 + $14,020 = $55,260. |     |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example | **Trust** |
| The trustee of the Golden Trust is a "mineral miner". The trust has three beneficiaries: Rex, Nick and Daisy. In year 1, the trust earned $80,000 taxable mining income from the relevant permit area. It distributed $20,000 to each of the beneficiaries as beneficiary income (and paid tax on that income as agent for the trustees under section HC 32) and retained $20,000 as trustee income. The beneficiaries are in the following situations for the year:<br><br>*   Rex has carried forward losses of $20,000;<br>*   Nick has no income other than that received from the trust;<br>*   Daisy is employed on an annual salary of $50,000.<br><br>At the end of year 1, the trust's mining activity ceases and in year 2 it incurs $80,000 of rehabilitation expenditure and derives no other income.<br><br>Because the expenditure is rehabilitation expenditure, the trustee is entitled to a tax credit. The beneficiary income from year 1 is required to be counted first. For each $20,000 distribution, the tax liability was as follows:<br><br>*   Rex paid no tax because the distribution simply absorbed his carry-forward losses;<br>*   Ben paid tax on $20,000 at $2,520;<br>*   Daisy earned a total of $70,000 but this distribution is treated as her first income, meaning her tax liability on the $20,000 is also treated as being $2,520.<br><br>This makes a total credit from the $60,000 distributed of $5,040. There is still $20,000 of rehabilitation expenditure required to be offset at the trustee tax rate, making an additional credit of $6,600.<br><br>The trustee's total tax credit is therefore $5,040 + 6,600 = $11,640. |     |

#### _Relationship with other rules_

Section LU 1(8) clarifies that a loss that is able to generate a credit does not form part of a tax loss component or net mining loss for the miner. This is to avoid the loss being double counted (that is, used to generate a credit and then used again to offset other income).

### Continuity and loss-offset rules

The previous concession that allowed losses in a company that is a mineral miner to survive a breach in shareholder continuity has been retained (section IA 7(7)). In a set of rules which are not as generous as they were, this concession could still pose a revenue risk which could result in inappropriate loss trading. To mitigate this risk, the existing rules that prevent mining companies from forming a consolidated group with companies that are not mineral miners (in section FM 31) have also been retained, as have the specific loss-offset rules in subpart IS. Sections IS 3 and 4 have been repealed because the ability to offset mining income against losses by holding companies was largely only relevant in the concessionary rules, when losses could be relatively easily accumulated in holding companies. Given there is no restriction on the activities that a holding company can undertake, there is a risk that allowing this offsetting to continue (coupled with the ability of losses to survive a continuity breach) could result in mining losses being inappropriately offset against income from other sources.

Listed research providers (section LH 15)
=========================================

2007 research and development related legislation (s LH 15) sets out the requirements to be listed as a research provider and the administrative rules for listing.

Section LH 15 sets out the requirements to be listed with the Commissioner as a research provider and the administrative rules for listing. Payments to an unassociated listed research provider are not subject to the minimum threshold of $20,000 of eligible expenditure each year. However, the payment must be for eligible expenditure (as calculated under section LH 4).

If a provider is delisted, payments under an arrangement entered into when the provider was still listed are not subject to the minimum threshold. (See discussion above on section LH 2(3) and (4).)

To be listed, a person must give notice to the Commissioner that it has the capability to perform contracted R&D, has R&D facilities in New Zealand and undertakes to meet the continuing requirements set out in subsection (3).

The continuing requirements are that the provider will charge fees on commercial terms, be available to undertake work on behalf of unrelated parties, and will maintain records to show that it satisfies the requirements to be listed and to show the amounts derived and incurred in carrying out R&D on behalf of others.

Inland Revenue will check the first two requirements and list the research provider if it is satisfied they are met. Listing does not constitute an endorsement of the provider. It means the research provider has satisfied Inland Revenue it has the capability to undertake R&D for others and has facilities in New Zealand. The list will be publicly available on the Inland Revenue website from 1 April 2008.

The provider is listed until it seeks to be removed from the list or is delisted by the Commissioner. Either party must give notice to the other and subsections (6) and (7) set out the dates on which the delisting takes effect.

The Commissioner may refuse to list a person who has been delisted in the past if the Commissioner considers that the person does not meet the start-up requirements or will not meet the continuing requirements on listed research providers.

No challenge is available to the Commissioner's decision to delist a provider.

#### Industry research co-operatives (section LH 16)

Industry research co-operatives fall into two categories. They can be organisations, generally in the primary sector, that collect levies from those in an industry and apply them to various purposes, including R&D.

Outside the primary sector, they may be co-operatives set up within an industry that receive contributions for various activities, including R&D.

These organisations are unlikely to be in business, but the R&D they either conduct or commission on behalf of businesses in the relevant industry is eligible for the credit. Those in business in the industry and making payments to the co-operative will not be eligible for the credit in relation to those levies or contributions. Industry research co-operatives are therefore not required to be in business. (See discussion above on section LH 1(1)(b).) The exemption does not flow through to entities controlled by the co-operative.

The co-operative must be undertaking or commissioning R&D mainly on behalf of its members, who:

*   must be New Zealand businesses (either as residents or through a fixed establishment in New Zealand);
*   would meet the requirements in section LH 2 if they carried out or commissioned the R&D and if the minimum threshold did not apply; and
*   contribute to the financing of the R&D activity.

Also, the R&D activities must relate to the businesses of those who make contributions or pay levies. (See discussion above on section LH 2(2)(a)(ii).)

Expenditure of an industry research co-operative that is sourced from funds contributed by a person who is not eligible is not eligible expenditure of the co-operative. This is to prevent co-operatives being used to circumvent the requirements for eligibility. (See discussion above on ineligible expenditure Schedule 21, Part B, clause 16.)

#### Depreciation base for tax-exempt entities (section LH 14

R&D tax credits are potentially available to most entities undertaking an R&D activity, including charities and not-for-profit entities which have only exempt income.

The normal rules for calculating depreciation loss are ineffective for entities which generate only exempt income from an asset. Section LH 14 provides rules to calculate a notional amount of depreciation loss these entities can claim a credit for.

When an entity conducting or commissioning R&D has not previously been allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss for an asset because it derives only exempt income, it is treated as acquiring the asset on the first day of the 2008-09 income year for market value, or on the actual date of acquisition at cost, whichever is the later.

These entities are then considered, solely for the purposes of calculating the amount of depreciation loss for the purposes of the credit, to have had deductions for depreciation in every year since acquisition. This does not allow the entity to actually claim a deduction for depreciation loss, but does lead to the correct amount of depreciation loss to use in calculating the amount of R&D tax credit.

##### Example (Depreciation base for tax-exempt entities (section LH 14)

A, a charitable society, undertakes R&D in 2010-11. A Digital Serial Analyser, purchased new in 2007, is mainly used in the R&D activity and the resulting depreciation loss would be deductible if A derived assessable income. A’s income year runs from 1 April to 31 March, and an independent valuation of the analyser on 1 April 2008 puts its market value at $35,000.

For the purposes of calculating the depreciation loss which is eligible for the credit in 2010-11, A assumes the analyser was purchased on 1 April for $35,000. The applicable depreciation rate for the analyser is 26.4 percent (diminishing value rate for an oscilloscope with 20 percent loading).

A is treated as being allowed a deduction for depreciation loss in each of the 2008-09, 2009-10, and 2010-11 income years, being the completed income years following deemed acquisition. Therefore, the assumed amounts of depreciation loss and adjusted tax values (ATV) in each year are:

| Income year | ATV at beginning of year | Depreciation loss |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2008-09 | Cost = $35,000 | 26.4% x $35,000 = $9,240 |
| 2009-10 | $35,000 - $9,240 = $25,760 | 26.4% x $25,760 = $6,800 |
| 2010-11 | $25,760 - $6,800 = $18,960 | 26.4% x $18,960 = $5,005 |

In the 2010-11 income year, A can claim a tax credit for $5,005 of eligible depreciation loss.

If the Digital Serial Analyser, instead of being purchased new in 2007, was previously used in New Zealand, the applicable depreciation rate for the analyser would be 22 percent (diminishing value rate for an oscilloscope without 20 percent loading).

Listing intermediaries - property managers and agents
=====================================================

GST rules for listing intermediaries deal with situations when more than 1 person is involved in the supply of accommodation through an online marketplace from 1 April 2024. Common examples are property managers and agents.

Overview - listing intermediaries
---------------------------------

A listing intermediary is a GST-registered person who lists short-stay and visitor accommodation on an online marketplace on behalf of the accommodation owner.

You are only considered a listing intermediary if you have entered into an agreement with an online marketplace to list or advertise accommodation provided by an owner. The agreement must be in your name (or trading name).

If you have not entered into an agreement with the online marketplace, you are not a listing intermediary. You must provide the online marketplace with relevant information about the owner, including the owner’s GST registration status and bank account information.

If you are a listing intermediary, you:

*   need to administer the flat-rate credit scheme
*   may need to help larger accommodation owners opt out
*   may be able to agree with the online marketplace you will be responsible for the GST.

Collecting and paying GST on supplies
-------------------------------------

In most cases the online marketplace will collect and pay GST of 15% on accommodation (and any closely connected services) supplied through their online marketplace. This includes any services you may supply to the guest for a fee through the marketplace, such as cleaning or providing fresh linen.

You must treat these supplies of accommodation and any closely connected services as zero-rated in your GST return.

You are not required to provide taxable supply information to the online marketplace for these supplies.

In certain circumstances, you and the online marketplace can enter into an agreement stating that you will collect and pay GST of 15% on the supplies. To be able to enter into an agreement, you must:

*   be a New Zealand tax resident
*   list the accommodation provided by the owner on more than one online marketplace
*   use an electronic system that automatically manages guests’ bookings. Common examples include Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that send information between your system and the online marketplace, or property management software you use to manage the bookings.

The online marketplace will remain responsible for providing the guest with taxable supply information.

Administering the flat-rate credit scheme
-----------------------------------------

If you are a listing intermediary, you will need to administer the flat-rate credit scheme for non-GST-registered owners. This includes:

*   passing on a flat-rate credit of 8.5% of the value of the supply to the non-GST-registered accommodation owner
*   providing regular statements to the accommodation owner, showing the flat-rate credits passed on
*   claiming a credit adjustment for the flat-rate credits in your GST return.

### Calculating flat-rate credits

Calculate flat-rate credits based on the accommodation and any closely connected services provided by the owner. This means you do not include the value of any services you provide to the guest that you charge a fee for (such as cleaning or providing fresh linen).

Opt-out for large accommodation owners
--------------------------------------

Some owners can choose to opt out of online marketplace GST rules, so they remain responsible for collecting and paying GST and issuing taxable supply information themselves.

[Opt-out rules for large accommodation owners](/sharing-economy/online-marketplaces/gst-on-listed-services/opt-out-rules-accommodation)

### Owners choosing to opt out

If you deal with the online marketplace on behalf of an owner who meets the opt-out criteria and wants to opt out, you may need to do 1 of the following:

*   notify the online marketplace that the owner is opting out
*   liaise with the owner and online marketplace so they can enter into an opt-out agreement.

Only owners can opt out using these rules. For example, if you list more than 2,000 nights of accommodation on an online marketplace for your owners, you cannot get an opt-out agreement with the online marketplace to become liable for GST because you list more than 2,000 nights of taxable accommodation.

You also cannot group your owners together to apply for an opt-out agreement on their behalf, so that they still collect and pay GST and issue taxable supply information.

Owners can only opt out if they individually meet the criteria for opting out.

### Listing intermediary responsible for GST on supplies of accommodation

If you have agreed with an online marketplace that you will collect and pay GST of 15% on supplies of accommodation, the owner needs to do 1 of the following to opt out:

*   notify you they are opting out (if they make more than $500,000 of supplies in a 12-month period)
*   enter into an opt-out agreement with you (if they meet 1 of the other opt-out criteria).

When you operate a website or app
---------------------------------

If you also operate a website or app that allows guests to book accommodation from accommodation owners, you will be an online marketplace for those bookings. 

For more information about how the rules apply to online marketplaces, see our factsheet AD278.

[Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-livestock-valuation-assets-expenditure-and-remedial-matters-act-2013 "Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013")

Livestock amendments
====================

2013 technical amendments to the law regarding livestock support earlier legislation that made elections to exit the herd scheme irrevocable.

_Sections EC 4B, EC 4C, EC 7, EC 8, EC 11, EC 20, EC 21, FB 15, YB 1 and Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

These amendments follow on from the 2012 Budget legislation that made herd scheme elections irrevocable. The original proposals were announced on 28 March 2012, but were then subject to further consultation and refinement. The changes in the new legislation reflect the results of this further consultation.

### Background

It became apparent that some farmers were taking inappropriate advantage of the ability to exit the herd scheme with a short period of notice to achieve tax-free increases in livestock values under the herd scheme, and tax deductible decreases in values under a cost-based regime. Along with this, a few farmers were doing associated parties transactions to achieve the same result.

Officials released an issues paper on the problem and potential reforms on 18 August 2011. While there was debate on alternative solutions, there was complete acceptance of the problem, both at a high level and in detail. This led to the Government's 28 March 2012 announcement that, from 18 August 2011, elections to exit the herd scheme could not be made.

These technical amendments in the new legislation follow on from the Budget 2012 amendments that made an election to use the herd scheme irrevocable. While the new legislation generally follows the pattern of the 28 March 2012 announcement, a number of enhancements have been made.

### Key features

The amendments deal with specified livestock only (sheep, beef and dairy cattle, deer, pigs and goats). They deal with:

*   associated persons transactions where and to the extent that the vendor is using the herd scheme - essentially the purchaser assumes the vendor's herd scheme elections, base numbers and values;
*   exceptions from associated persons rules for inter-generational transfers - the effect being that the qualifying purchaser is free to make their own valuation elections;
*   refinements to the rules for ceasing farming other than by way of an associated persons transaction when the vendor is using the herd scheme;
*   an exception to the irrevocable herd scheme election rule when the farming operation changes to a fattening operation;
*   there is some rationalisation of specified livestock classes; and
*   a number of supporting detailed amendments.

### Detailed analysis

In summary the amendments are:

*   Section EC 4B makes the use of the herd scheme compulsory for associated party transfers of livestock the vendor would otherwise have valued in the herd scheme, and provides an exception for inter-generational sales.
*   Section EC 4C provides the values at which these herd scheme livestock are to be worth transferred at.
*   Section EC 7 is a clarifying amendment.
*   Section EC 8, which deals with restrictions arising from the use of the herd scheme, has been replaced in two tranches. The first tranche, which applies from 18 August 2011, introduces an exception to the herd scheme election being irrevocable if the farming operation changes to a fattening operation. The second tranche, which applies from 28 March 2012, adds mechanical issues to do with base herd scheme numbers.
*   Section EC 11, which deals with restrictions on making elections, has been consequentially amended.
*   Section EC 20, which deals with valuations upon ceasing farming has been amended to introduce a before or after 1 November date for the compulsory use of opening or closing herd scheme values.
*   Section EC 21, which used to deal with herd scheme valuation elections on a farmer's death, is repealed as its purpose has been subsumed by the associated persons transaction rules.
*   Section FB 15, which deals with matrimonial property transfers, has been amended to make it clear that one party steps into the other party's position when a matrimonial property settlement involved livestock valued under the herd scheme.
*   Schedule 17 is amended to rationalise certain classes of livestock.

### Associated party transfers of herd scheme livestock

_Sections EC 4B, EC 4C, EC 8, EC 11 and FB 15_

Some farmers used associated party transactions in an attempt to exit the herd scheme without giving the required advance notice. Inland Revenue questioned some of these transactions and it became clear that a legislative response to associated persons was required when the vendor used the herd scheme.

However, as a result of submissions it became apparent that this could inappropriately impose tax on inter-generational transfers of herd scheme livestock, and it was agreed to exempt these in appropriate circumstances - these circumstances are limited.

The amendments apply from 28 March 2012.

_The core rule_

The new rules provide that for associated persons transfers of herd scheme livestock the acquirer steps into the position of the vendor for the herd scheme election, herd scheme base numbers and herd scheme values.

The general definition of "associated person" applies.

The associated persons rules only apply where the transfer is not in the ordinary course of business. Thus a father and son situation where the son runs the back country breeding farm and the father runs a front country fattening farm will generally not come under rule if the father buys stock from the son to fatten. However, if the father doubles the size of his farm and buys some breeding stock (other than stock that the son would have ordinarily been culled) from the son, then that stock will be subject to the new rules. Given the various potential scenarios this has been deliberately left up to the parties' judgement. Common sense should apply.

In qualifying circumstances, the transferee will be treated as having made a herd scheme election (section EC 4B(4)). This overrides the more general herd scheme election rules.

These circumstances are where the vendor would otherwise have valued those livestock in the herd scheme at the end of his or her income year. This is controlled by the formula in section EC 4B(5). The steps involved are as follows:  
Step 1: The vendor calculates hypothetical year-end numbers for a class as if the associated persons sale had not taken place.  
Step 2: These are then compared with the vendor's opening herd scheme tallies for that class.  
Step 3: The lowest of these numbers (being the minimum that the vendor could value in the herd scheme in the year of transfer if the transfer had not occurred) becomes the "hypothetical year-end herd scheme amount".  
Step 4: From this is subtracted the actual year-end numbers of the class that the vendor has on hand.  
Step 5: The balance is then the number of livestock of that class that the associated person acquirer must value in the herd scheme.

Note that the calculations focus on the class that the livestock would be (or would have been) at year-end, not as at the date of the transfer.

Example 

| Step | R2 Heifers | Example A | Example B |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.  | On hand at year-end | 80  | 80  |
| 1.  | Associated party transfer | 25  | 15  |
| 1.  | Hypothetical year-end numbers | 105 | 95  |
| 2.  | Opening herd scheme | 100 | 100 |
| 3.  | Lesser of | 100 | 95  |
| 4.  | Actual on hand | 80  | 80  |
| 5.  | Therefore acquirer herd scheme | 20  | 15  |

Subsections EC 8(3)-(4) as they apply from 28 March 2012 provide that the acquirer's minimum herd scheme numbers for that class and that year are increased by the number obtained from the section EC 4B(5) formula that is illustrated immediately above.

_Matrimonial property settlements_

Section FB 15 has been consequentially amended as the associated persons herd scheme rules should apply to these settlements.

_Associated party transfer values for income tax purposes_

Section EC 4C provides that for income tax purposes the transfer of livestock that the acquirer is required to value in the herd scheme is deemed to take place at herd scheme values that apply at the end of the year of the transfer, presuming that both parties are in the same tax year when the transfer takes place. If this is not the case, it depends on which of the parties is in a later tax year, but the objective is to ensure that there is one herd scheme adjustment to opening herd scheme livestock valuations for each tax year.

If the acquirer is in an earlier tax year than the transferor's, the values are the vendor's opening herd scheme values for the vendor's year of transfer. That is, the acquirer acquires the transferred herd scheme livestock at the herd value that applies at the end of the acquirer's tax year.

If the acquirer is in a later tax year than the vendor, the values are the vendor's closing herd scheme values for the vendor's year of transfer. For the purposes of the herd scheme adjustment in the year the acquirer received the herd scheme livestock, only the acquirer is deemed to own them at the end of their previous year.

For GST purposes, the sale is taxed at the values it actually occurs at. Where the vendor is a company, any difference between sale values and deemed tax values is regarded as an increase or decrease to retained earnings and under current law is taxable upon distribution.

For tax purposes any other livestock transfer at the usual market values.

#### _Intra-generational exception to the associated persons rule_

Where there is a clear transfer of herd scheme livestock down the generations (parents or grandparents to children or grandchildren) then in qualifying circumstances the associated persons rule does not apply.

In brief:

*   the lower generation should have had no interest in the livestock before the transfer;
*   the higher generation should cease deriving income from the disposal of specified livestock; and
*   the transaction should be at market values and, except for financing, market terms.

_Associated persons_

To make this work there is a complicated application of the associated persons rules. Essentially, where the only connection up the generations is the blood relationship between the generations then the exception can apply. Thus if the lower generation are not associated with a trust, or a company or a partnership or a sole trader which is the livestock owning entity, other than by the blood relationship, the exception can apply.

Examples of non-association include where the lower generation are not:

*   beneficiaries of the higher generations' trust that owns and farms the livestock;
*   associated with the higher generations' company that owns and farms the livestock except through the blood relationship; and
*   associated with the higher generations' blood relations (and their entities) where there is no other association and the blood relations (and their entities) carry on a separate farming business.

_Ceasing deriving income from livestock_

The higher generation should cease deriving income directly or indirectly from the disposal of specified livestock that is part of a business for the next four years. Thus the vendor can graze a few animals on a lifestyle block (for the freezer or whatever), or can retain the land and enter into a 50/50 sharemilking arrangement with the next generation, or can start farming non-specified livestock, all without disturbing the exception.

The "indirectly" reference is to the situation when the livestock are owned by a trust or company that the vendor is associated with. The four-year period was chosen because it should be long enough to confirm there was a genuine intention to cease deriving income from livestock.

_Deceased farmers and their estates_

Section EC 4B(3) provides that the associated persons exception will apply to a deceased estate if:

*   the more general associated persons exception would have applied had the deceased (or a person associated with the deceased) transferred the herd scheme livestock to the next generation, who are capital beneficiaries of the will, immediately before his or her death; and
*   the estate does not have a life tenant.

Section EC 21, which governed herd scheme values where the farmer died, has been repealed as the associated party rules, and the exception thereto, will, as appropriate, apply.

### Change of use exception to the irrevocability of herd scheme election rule

When the farming operation changes from a breeding operation to a fattening operation, a one-off election to leave the herd scheme is available. This recognises that a cost-based regime is likely to be more appropriate for a fattening operation.

Specifically, for a type of specified livestock where the farmer's intention is that they cease to be used for a breeding business, and instead are used in a fattening business, a written election to exit the herd scheme for that type of livestock may be given.

This election applies from 18 August 2011, the date that the revocation of the more general election to exit the herd scheme applies from.

### Cessation of farming by third party sale

Section EC 20, which used to provide that farmers who were using the herd scheme could elect, in qualifying circumstances, whether to make an opening herd scheme valuation adjustment, has been amended to make it compulsory not to adjust opening herd scheme values. The amendment means:

*   it applies when the farmer ceases deriving income from the disposal of specified livestock (that is, they could still own land subject to a 50/50 sharemilking agreement);
*   the sale is not an associated persons sale, except where the inter-generation exception applies;
*   it is compulsory when the cessation occurs before 1 November; and
*   the notice requirement has been repealed.

This applies from the start of the 2012-13 income year.

#### _Rationalisation of some classes of livestock_

There has been some concern expressed about the uncertainties of whether dairy cattle are Friesian or Jersey, and whether some deer are Red or Wapiti. The 17th Schedule has been amended to combine these breeds. This is effective from the 2014-15 year. It is acknowledged that this will result in some averaging of herd scheme values (eg, Friesian values will decrease a bit and Jersey values will increase).

As an interim measure, for the 2012-13 and 2013-14 years, these breeds are regarded by section EC 8 as being combined. This section, among other things, deals with minimum livestock numbers in the herd scheme. Where dairy cattle or deer change from one breed to the other (for example Friesian to Jersey), the minimum numbers for each class are added together.

Livestock evaluation-Election of method
=======================================

QB (Jun 2004) considers whether an election notice made under the livestock valuation regime to exit the Herd Scheme, is a valid election.

We have been asked whether an election notice made under the livestock valuation regime to exit the Herd Scheme, which contains more than one proposed method of valuation in relation to a class of livestock within a type, is a valid election.

On the basis of the interpretation of the words in section EL 2(1) and section EL 2(5) in particular and the scheme and purpose of the livestock valuation regime (as reflected in the statutory scheme and pre-legislative material) the Commissioner considers that the livestock valuation regime permits one future method of valuation per class of livestock to be contained in an election notice to remove a type of livestock from the Herd Scheme.

The Commissioner considers that a valid election notice may state different valuation methods for different classes of livestock within a type (provided that the combination of methods used complies with section EL 2(2)), but a valid election notice may not state **more** than one valuation method for a particular class of livestock.

**Legislation**

Section EL 2(4) states that taxpayers wishing to exit the Herd Scheme must provide notification when filing their tax return for the income year two years prior to the year in which the scheme change is to occur.  Section EL 2(1) is the initial provision providing for elections to be made and it also provides that taxpayers may elect another method when wishing to exit the Herd Scheme and that that method will apply until superseded by a further election. Sections EL 2(4) and EL 2(2)(d) mean that it is not possible to remove a class of livestock from the Herd Scheme unless **all** of the classes within the type to which that class belongs are also removed from the Herd Scheme. Section EL 2(5) provides the elements which must be contained in the notice.

Section EL 2(1) provides that:

1.  Subject always to this section and sections EL 3 to EL 7 and FF 9,-

1.  A taxpayer may elect which of the methods specified in sections EL 3 to EL 7 is to be used in any income year to value any specified livestock of the taxpayer other than livestock used in dealing operations; and
2.  Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4), any such election shall be sufficiently notified to the Commissioner, and shall apply for an income year, by the mere fact of the relevant valuation method being used for the purposes of the taxpayer's return of income for the income year; and
3.  Any election once made in accordance with this section and applying in respect of any income year shall continue to apply in all subsequent income years until superseded by a further election made in accordance with this section.

Section EL 2(5) provides that:

*   Any written notice of election required to be furnished under this section shall-

1.  State the income year in which the election is to first apply; and
2.  State the type, class, or other description of livestock to which the election relates; and
3.  State both the existing and the proposed valuation methods for the livestock to which the election relates; and
4.  In the case of an election under section EL 6(1) to use a herd value ratio or recalculated herd value ratio, state-

1.  The value assessed under section EL 6(3) of an average animal of the taxpayer of each class of livestock within the type to which the election relates; and
2.  The date on which the valuation of each such animal was made; and
3.  The name and address of the person who carried out the valuation; and

6.  In the case of an election to use a bailed livestock option referred to in section EZ 4(1), specify which of the 2 options under that section the taxpayer is electing to use,-

and, once the written notice of election is furnished to the Commissioner, the election shall be irrevocable in relation to its first year of application.

The following definitions from section OB 1 are also relevant to the interpretation of Sections EL 2(1) and EL 2(5):

*   **"Class"**, in the definitions of "high-priced livestock" and "national average market value", and in Part EL and sections EZ 1 and EZ 4, in relation to specified livestock, means any of the categories of livestock listed in column 2 of Schedule 8; and, when used in relation to any particular type of livestock, means any of the categories so listed in relation to that particular type:  
    
*   **"Specified livestock"** means any animal that is, in relation to any of the types of livestock set out in column 1 of Schedule 8, an animal of that type; but does not include any animal that is high-priced livestock:  
    
*   **"Type"**, in the definitions of "class", "herd livestock", "herd value ratio", "high-priced livestock", and "specified livestock", and in Parts EL, EZ, and FF, in relation to specified livestock, means any general category of livestock listed in column 1 of Schedule 8:  
    

**Application of the legislation-the ordinary meaning of the words in section EL 2(1)**

By virtue of the section OB 1 definitions (outlined above) and Schedule 8 of the Income Tax Act, when the word "type" is used in relation to the livestock valuation regime, it refers to the variety of animal involved, e.g. dairy cattle or sheep. When the word "class" is used in relation to the livestock valuation regime, it refers to the sub-categories within the type of livestock, e.g. mixed age cows, rising one year heifers, ewe hoggets, or ram and wether hoggets.

The phrase "**which** of the **methods** specified in section EL 3 to EL 7 **is** to be used to value **any specified livestock**" in section EL 2(1), refers to a single method of valuation, in relation to each class of livestock within the type of livestock which is subject to the election, which is chosen from a number of different methods available to be selected.

The _Shorter Oxford English Dictionary_ defines "which" as:

*   **Which:** 3. Used in asking the identity of a choice made from a definite (stated or implied) set of alternatives.

In ordinary usage when the word "is" is contrasted to "are", it refers to singular items. This is confirmed by the definitions of "is" and "are" in the _New Collins Concise English Dictionary_:

*   **Is:** (used with he, she, it, and with singular nouns) a form of the present tense (indicative mood) or be.
  
*   **Are:** the plural form of the present tense of **be** and the singular form used with _you_.

These definitions indicate that "is" is used when indicating a singular and "are" is used when indicating a plural.  By contrasting these definitions, it is possible to conclude that had the word "are" been used in Section EL 2(1), it would be acceptable to choose more than one valuation method per class of livestock; however the use of "is" in the subsection indicates that only one valuation method may be stated in relation to a class of livestock within the type of livestock to which the election relates.

In addition the _Shorter Oxford English Dictionary_ defines "is" as:

*   **Is:** That which exists, that which is; the fact or quality of existence.

While it appears that the definition of "is" refers to the existence of something (in the sense of the present rather than the past tense), the use of the word "that" in the definition of "is", and everyday usage of "is", indicates that a singular item is intended by the definition:

*   "that" is defined by the _Shorter Oxford English Dictionary_ as:  
      
    **That:** 1. The thing or ... person indicated, mentioned or understood.  
    
*   "that" refers to singular items in the present tense. If more than one item was to be referred to, a word such as "those", would be used.

The _Shorter Oxford English Dictionary_ defines "methods" as:

*   **Method:** 2. A mode of procedure; a (defined or systematic) way of doing a thing, esp. ... in accordance with a particular theory or as associated with a particular person

The methods referred to in section EL 2(1) are the various types of ways in which livestock may be valued according to the livestock valuation regime.

When "which" and "is" are used in conjunction a single item is suggested.  This is based on the grammar the section uses - if more than one item was permitted the words "which" and "are" would be used together.

**Application of the legislation - the ordinary meaning of the words in section EL 2(5)**

Section EL 2(5)(a) requires the notice furnished by the taxpayer to "state the type, class, or other description of livestock to which the election relates". As the election notice may describe livestock by type or class or other description, different valuation methods may be used for different classes within the type of livestock being removed from the Herd Scheme, provided that the combination of methods used complies with section EL 2(2).

The words "livestock to which the election relates" are important in interpreting the provision. As Section EL 2(2)(d) requires that all animals within a type of livestock must be removed from the Herd Scheme when making such an election, the "livestock to which the election relates" are all of the classes of livestock within the type which is to exit the Herd Scheme. It is not required that all animals within the type of livestock being removed from the Herd Scheme are moved to the same future valuation method.

The words used in section EL 2(5)(c) "state both the existing and the proposed valuation methods for the livestock to which the election relates" also require interpretation.

The use of the plural "method**s**" in section EL 2(5)(c) requires two methods to be stated: one existing method and one proposed method.  The plural does not attach to just the proposed method, allowing more than one to be stated, and to read the subsection in this way ignores the importance of the final sentence of the subsection.

The section uses the words "both ... methods". The _Shorter_ _Oxford_ _English Dictionary_ gives the meaning of "both":

*   **Both:** Adj. The one and the other; the two (and not just one)
  
*   **Both:** Pron. 1. The one and the other (and not just one)
  
*   2\. Each, the two, of (two persons, things, etc)

These definitions support the view that "both" the existing method and proposed method of valuation are required to be stated in the notice of election.  The word "both" in its ordinary meaning is used to refer to two items, not more than two items.

While an argument could be made that the word "**methods**" supports the view that a farmer providing a notice to the Commissioner could state more than one future method of valuation in an "either/or" format  this argument is not considered to be a strong one.  That interpretation would be more arguable if the subsection was worded: "state the existing and the proposed valuation methods for the livestock ...", however the use of the word "both" makes the above interpretation more difficult to sustain.

The final words of section EL 2(5) which state "once the written notice of election is furnished to the Commissioner, the election shall be irrevocable in relation to its first year of application" are also important in concluding that a single method of valuation is required.

The _Shorter Oxford English Dictionary_ defines "election" as the making of a choice. "Choice" is defined as "choosing or deciding between possibilities".  Consequently, when a farmer makes an election, a decision as to which particular future valuation method to use **must** be made; it is not acceptable for **more** than one future valuation method to be stated for a class of livestock .

Also, the word "irrevocable" used in the final words of the subsection colours the interpretation of the whole of subsection (5).

The _Shorter Oxford English Dictionary_ defines "irrevocable" as:

*   **Irrevocable:** 1. Unable to be recalled or recovered
  
*   2\. Unable to be annulled or undone; unaltered, irreversible.

The Commissioner considers that on the plain meaning of the provision the **whole** of the election notice furnished is required to be irrevocable (as opposed to the subsection just requiring either the exiting of the Herd Scheme to be irrevocable or the proposed method to be irrevocable) as it states "**the election** shall be irrevocable".  The election includes the livestock to which the election relates, and the existing method and the future method of valuation for each class of livestock - these factors make up the entire election, which will be "irrevocable in relation to the first year of application". This means that for the year after the election takes effect(i.e. the year after the change in methods actually occurs) the election to remove the type of livestock from the Herd Scheme cannot be changed and the proposed valuation methods selected for each class of livestock within that type cannot be changed.  

It is not acceptable for an "either/or" type of election to be made in relation to a class of livestock.  Such an election is not "irrevocable", as a choice is still to be made at a later stage as to which future method of valuation will be used to value that particular class, making the election uncertain. The fact that the election itself is stated to be irrevocable could also be seen as inconsistent with being able to make an "either/or" type of election.  By making an "either/or" type of election, the election would not ordinarily be described as irrevocable as there is no certainty as to which method has actually been selected for that class.  In order for the election to be "irrevocable" it seems more intuitive that a definite choice of valuation methods must be made.

**The purpose of the livestock valuation regime**

Although strong arguments can be made on the words of section EL 2(1) and section EL 2(5) that a singular method of valuation is to be selected, it is useful to examine the purpose or the legislative intent of the livestock valuation regime to discern the meaning of the provisions. The pre-legislative material e.g. _The Discussion Paper on Livestock Valuation_ dated December 1991, _The Report of the Consultative Committee on Livestock_, 2 September 1992, and relevant material in _Hansard_ supports the view that only one "proposed" method of valuation per class of livestock may be contained in an election notice. 

_New Zealand_ _Income Tax Law and Practice_ (CCH) provides a general description of the Herd Scheme:

Essentially the herd scheme treats livestock as a capital asset so that any upward or downward movement in herd values between income years is treated as a capital gain or loss, and is not assessable or deductible for tax purposes ... Thus, an important point with the herd scheme is that changes in herd values between years are not taxable. Taxable income or deductible losses arise only to the extent of changes in the numbers of herd livestock.

The _Report_ _of the Consultative Committee on Livestock Valuation_, 2 September 1992 also describes the Herd Scheme:

The herd scheme is intended to reflect the fact that in some respects a herd or flock can be likened to a "machine". The "machine" is a relatively fixed asset, owned and maintained for the sale value of what it produces, rather than for its own inherent sales value. The herd scheme exempts from tax any inflationary gains on the realisation of the "machine" over and above its "cost", but rather than permitting annual depreciation, the scheme gives tax deductions for the annual cost of "repairs and maintenance" i.e. the difference between the value of replacement animals and the proceeds from the sale of the stock replaced.

The livestock valuation regime (including the Herd Scheme) was enacted to ensure that farmers were treated in the same manner as other business taxpayers.  While it is acknowledged that the Herd Scheme was seen as largely concessionary, as it allows farmers to treat their herd of animals as a capital asset, restrictions were also imposed upon the exit from the scheme so that farmers were encouraged to choose a scheme which reflected long-term business needs, rather than simply for tax purposes.

The _Discussion Paper on Livestock Valuation_ commented on the notice period required in order to exit the Herd Scheme:

This restriction encourages farmers to choose a scheme which reflects the nature of their long-term business needs, rather than simply for tax purposes

The requirement that farmers choose which method of valuation they plan to use for each class of livestock within a type two years into the future was designed to put some "risk" into any decision to exit the Herd Scheme.  The "risk" involved having to predict the market values of the livestock two years in advance.

**Conclusion**

Accordingly, on the basis of the interpretation of the words in section EL 2(1) and section EL 2(5) in particular, and the scheme and purpose of the livestock valuation regime (as reflected in the statutory scheme and pre-legislative material) the Commissioner considers that the livestock valuation regime permits only one future method of valuation for each class of livestock to be contained in an election notice for a type of livestock to exit the Herd Scheme.

The Commissioner considers that a valid election notice may state different valuation methods for different classes of livestock within a type (provided that the combination of methods used complies with section EL 2(2)), but a valid election notice may not state **more** than one valuation method for a particular class of livestock.

Look-through companies and limited partnerships
===============================================

2012 amendments to the look-through company rules including the 'loss limitation rule' formula, and the definition of 'income' under the formula.

_Sections GB 32, HA 7B, HB 1, HB 11, HG 11, HZ 4B, HZ 4C and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and section 55 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985_

Several amendments have been made to the look-through company (LTC) rules to simplify some administrative provisions, and ensure the rules are consistent with the original policy intent.

The main changes involve the valuation of guarantees or indemnities for the purposes of the LTC deduction limitation formula in section HB 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (commonly referred to as the "loss limitation rule"). Changes have also been made to the definition of "income" under that formula.

Similar amendments have been made to equivalent provisions in the limited partnership (LP) deduction limitation formula in section HG 11.

Further changes simplify the initial basis calculation for a former qualifying company (QC) that transitions to either the LTC or LP tax rules, for the purposes of applying the deduction limitation formula under those rules.

There are also several minor remedial amendments to the LTC rules which cover:

*   elections, valuation methods and timing methods;
*   aggregation of relatives' interests under the look-through counted owner definition;
*   benefits provided to shareholders;
*   qualifying company amalgamations; and
*   GST group-filing rules.

### Background

The LTC rules were part of several tax measures introduced by the Government in Budget 2010. The new rules provided an elective look-through income tax treatment for closely held companies, and applied from 1 April 2011.

An LTC's tax treatment is integrated with the tax treatment of the owners. Broadly, the LTC rules provide a transparent tax treatment, similar to that used for partnerships, so that shareholders pay tax on any company profit at their marginal tax rate, and may also use the company's losses, subject to certain limitation rules.

### Key features

#### Amendments to the loss limitation rules

*   The definition of "secured amounts" provides for the valuation of a guarantee or indemnity given by an LTC owner, or a person associated with the owner, in respect of the LTC's debt. Similar rules exist for limited partners and LPs.
    *   If more than one guarantee is provided for the same debt, the amount of the debt guaranteed is divided by the number of guarantors.
    *   If the guarantee provided for an LTC's or LP's debt expressly limits the creditors' recourse by reference to specific property, the secured amount may be limited to the value of the guarantor's interests in that property.
*   An owner's share of the LTC income is increased, for the purposes of the loss limitation rules, if an owner's proportionate share of a dividend distributed by a foreign investment fund is higher than their amount of FIF income or FIF loss from that FIF. A similar rule applies for limited partners and LPs.
*   The market value method or the accounting book value method may be used by the owner of a transitioning QC for their initial basis calculation, to determine the opening value of the owner's equity or capital contribution. This initial basis valuation applies for the purposes of the LP and LTC loss limitation rules in the year of transition, and in all later years.

#### Other amendments

*   Elections, valuation or timing methods adopted in relation to an LTC's income or property are made or established by the LTC.
*   The look-through counted owner test does not aggregate the look-through interests of two people who are connected because one of them is a trustee of a trust under which a relative of the other has benefited or is eligible to benefit.
*   Benefits provided by an LTC to a shareholder are treated as a distribution of profits, and not as a fringe benefit of a (non-shareholder) employee associated with the shareholder.
*   An amalgamated company cannot use the QC rules following an amalgamation between a non-QC company and a QC.
*   An LTC is treated as a company for the purposes of GST group registration.

### Detailed analysis

#### LTC deduction limitation formula (the "loss limitation" rule)

Sections HB 11 and HB 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 ensure that owners' deductions are restricted if the amount of their deductions exceeds their owner's basis. These sections are widely referred to as the "loss limitation rules", although, more accurately, the sections provide a limitation on deductions. Under these rules the LTC deductions an owner can claim in an income year are limited to an amount equal to their owner's basis. The purpose of the rules is to ensure that owners can offset tax losses only to the extent these reflect their economic risk.

The owner's basis is calculated for each owner using the following formula:

_investments \- distributions + income \- deductions \- disallowed amounts_

The amendments in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act concern items included in the "investments" and "income" categories of this formula only. _Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol 23, No 1, February 2011, has more information on the owner's basis formula and the mechanics of the loss limitation rules in general.

#### Investments and secured amounts

The "investments" category of the owner's basis formula is the sum of the equity, assets introduced, or services provided, to the LTC, or any amounts paid by the owner on behalf of the LTC. This includes any loans, including shareholder current account credit balances, made by the owner to the LTC. It also includes the owner's share of any LTC debt for which they, or their associate, have provided a guarantee or indemnity; these are known as "secured amounts".

The inclusion of secured amounts within the investments category is intended to reflect that an owner may be at economic risk in respect of guarantees or indemnities that they (or an associate) have provided on the LTC's behalf, although these are not always reflected in the company balance sheet or the shareholder's loan account.

Amendments have been made to the definition of "secured amounts". These ensure that the secured amounts definition includes only appropriate guarantees or indemnities, and clarifies the amount an owner may include in their owner's basis in respect of a guarantee provided by an associated person.  

The amendments also simplify what happens in the event that a creditor's recourse under a guarantee is expressly limited to particular property of the person providing the guarantee. Such guarantees are referred to in this guidance as limited recourse guarantees.

#### Guarantees or indemnities in respect of loans advanced by an owner of an LTC

An owner may include the value of a guarantee or indemnity they provide in respect of an LTC's debt in the "investments" element of the owner's basis calculation. They may also include the value of a guarantee or indemnity given by an associate.

Section HB 11(5)(c) has been amended to ensure that this does not apply to a guarantee or indemnity provided by an owner or an associate in respect of a loan made to the LTC by another owner. This is to prevent double counting, because loans made by an owner are included in that owner's basis under section HB 11(5)(b).

#### Guarantor

There are several important definitions that are critical to calculating the amount of a guarantee or indemnity that an owner can include in their owner's basis under "secured amounts". A key definition is the definition of "guarantor".

An owner of an LTC will be a guarantor (an "owner guarantor") if:

*   the owner provides a guarantee or indemnity for the LTC debt; and/or
*   an _owner's associate_ provides a guarantee or indemnity for the LTC debt.

An _owner's associate_ is a person connected with the owner, such as a relative, or a trustee who is associated in their capacity as trustee (see examples 1a and 1b). An owner's associate cannot hold shares in the LTC (see example 1c).

A person who is not an owner of an LTC, and is not an owner's associate will be a guarantor (a "third party guarantor") if they provide a guarantee or indemnity for the LTC's debt (see example 1d).

##### Example 1a - Hampton Ltd

Elizabeth is the sole owner of Hampton Ltd, a look-through company. Elizabeth's mother Anne guarantees a bank loan made to Hampton Ltd. For the purpose of the secured amounts definition, Anne is an owner's associate, and so Elizabeth is treated as the guarantor (an "owner guarantor").

##### Example 1b - Steeple Ltd

Edward and Richard are the joint owners of Steeple Ltd, a look-through company. Their grandmother Cecily guarantees a bank loan made to Steeple Ltd. For the purpose of the secured amounts definition, Cecily is an owner's associate, and so both Edward and Richard are treated as owner guarantors.

##### Example 1c -Hapsburg Ltd

Mary owns 80% of the shares in Hapsburg Ltd, a look-through company. The remaining 20% of shares are owned by her husband Philip. Philip guarantees a bank loan made to Hapsburg Ltd.

Philip is an owner guarantor.

Mary is not a guarantor because she has not provided a guarantee, and although Philip is her relative, he is not her owner's associate because he is a shareholder in Hapsburg Ltd.

##### Example 1d - Greensleeves Ltd

Henry is the sole owner of Greensleeves Ltd, a look-through company. Henry provides a guarantee for a bank loan made to Greensleeves Ltd, so he is an owner guarantor. His friend Thomas also provides a guarantee. Thomas is not an owner's associate, because he is not a relative or trustee, so he is a third-party guarantor.

_Secured amounts - lesser of_

The secured amounts definition provides that the amount of a guarantee or indemnity that an owner may include in their owner's basis is the lesser of two possible amounts, described at paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition.

It is expected that paragraph (a) will be the operative provision for nearly all LTC owners.

Paragraph (b) concerns guarantees under which the creditor's recourse is expressly limited, which is atypical, and so paragraph (b) is unlikely to apply in most standard guarantee situations.

If paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) both apply, the amount an owner will include in their owner's basis is the lesser of the amounts calculated under each paragraph.

_Secured amounts - paragraph (a)_

Under paragraph (a) of the secured amounts definition, the amount an owner may include in their owner's basis is the amount of the LTC's debt for which the owner is a guarantor. As explained in the previous section, an owner will be a guarantor via their own guarantees, and guarantees made by an associate (examples 2a and 2b).

When there is more than one guarantor for the same debt, the amount of debt is divided between the number of guarantors (examples 2b and 2c). This includes a third-party guarantor, although they do not, themselves, have any owner's basis (example 2d).

The reason the debt amount is divided in this way is because the guarantors each have equal exposure under their respective guarantees. Apportioning the guaranteed debt amount between them on an equal basis is a way of accounting for this shared risk.

It is important to identify the LTC debt (the "secured debt") to which a guarantee relates. If guarantors provide a guarantee for different debts, or for differing proportions of the same debt, this will affect what is apportioned, and who is included within the apportionment (example 2e).

##### Example 2a - Hampton Ltd

Hampton Ltd receives a bank loan of $40,000. Elizabeth's mother Anne, an owner's associate, guarantees this loan. Elizabeth, as the owner guarantor, can include $40,000 as a "secured amount" in her owner's basis.

##### Example 2b - Steeple Ltd

Steeple Ltd receives a bank loan of $60,000. Cecily, the grandmother of its two owners, Edward and Richard, guarantees this loan. Both Edward and Richard are owner guarantors.

Because there are two guarantors, the $60,000 debt is divided by two. Edward and Richard can each include $30,000 in their owner's basis.

##### Example 2c - Hapsburg Ltd

Hapsburg Ltd receives a bank loan of $100,000. Philip guarantees this loan. Philip, the minority shareholder, is the only owner guarantor and can include $100,000 as a "secured amount" in his owner's basis. Mary, the majority shareholder, cannot include anything, as she is not a guarantor.

If Mary also provided a guarantee for the bank loan, there would be two owner guarantors, Philip and Mary. The $100,000 debt would be divided by two, and Philip and Mary could each include $50,000 in their owner's basis.

**Note:** The debt is divided by the number of guarantors. The fact that Mary and Philip hold different proportions of shares in Hapsburg Ltd is not relevant to the apportionment of the debt.

##### Example 2d - Greensleeves Ltd

Greensleeves Ltd receives a bank loan of $50,000. There are two guarantors - Henry, the sole owner of Greensleeves Ltd and his friend Thomas.

The $50,000 debt is divided by two, because there are two guarantors. Henry, as an owner guarantor, can include $25,000 in his owner's basis.

Thomas is not a shareholder in Greensleeves Ltd, so he does not have an owner's basis calculation.

##### Example 2e - Couer Ltd

Couer Ltd has two owners, Jane and Bess. Couer Ltd has a bank loan of $100,000, for which both Jane and Bess provide guarantees. Couer Ltd also has a loan from a finance company of $30,000, for which Jane is the sole guarantor.

The $100,000 debt is divided by two, because there are two guarantors. Jane and Bess, as owner guarantors, can each include $50,000 in their owner's basis.

The $30,000 debt is not divided, because there is only one guarantor. Jane can include $30,000 in her owner's basis in relation to this debt.

Jane has a secured amount of $80,000 in her owner's basis calculation, while Bess has a secured amount of $50,000.

_Secured amounts - paragraph (b)_

Paragraph (b) of the secured amounts definition will only be relevant if a guarantee is provided for an LTC's debt and the creditor's recourse is expressly limited under that guarantee. Such a guarantee is referred to in this guidance as a "limited recourse guarantee". Paragraph (b) is concerned with limited recourse guarantees provided by owner guarantors only, that is, guarantees made by an owner or an owner's associate. Guarantees by third-party guarantors are not taken into consideration.

A key definition is "recourse property". When a person provides a guarantee, but the creditor is expressly limited to taking legal recourse only against particular property and has no ability to seek reimbursement over and above what can be realised from that property, the property is referred to as "recourse property".

##### Example 3 - Dover Ltd

Charles is the sole shareholder in Dover Ltd, a look-through company. Dover Ltd receives a bank loan of $300,000.

Charles father William, an owner's associate, agrees to provide a personal guarantee for this loan, but also wants to protect some valuable family heirlooms. Under the terms of the guarantee the bank is able to seek full reimbursement of the guarantee from William, but may only take any legal recourse action against William's two rental properties. These rental properties are "recourse property" under this definition.

**Note:** A creditor may require a mortgage or similar charge to be placed over property owned by the person providing the guarantee, to provide some collateral security. The mortgage charge by itself offers some level of protection to a creditor, but it does not limit the creditor's ability to take legal recourse against any of the guarantor's other assets if necessary, to meet the outstanding loan amounts. In these situations, the property under mortgage charge is not "recourse property". Such guarantees will be dealt with under paragraph (a) of the secured amounts definition.

When there is a limited recourse guarantee, the secured amount under paragraph (b) is the net market value of the recourse property; that is, the market value of the property on the last day of the relevant income year, less any other charges against that property that would have a higher creditor priority.

##### Example 4 - Dover Ltd (continued)

William has provided a limited recourse guarantee for his son Charles' company, Dover Ltd which has a bank loan of $300,000. William uses his two rental properties as recourse property. Due to some severe storm damage, the rental properties have recently declined in value. Their current market value is $140,000 each and both have an outstanding mortgage loan of $30,000 which would take creditor priority in the event that the properties are sold.

The amount that Charles may include in his owner's basis is $220,000, being the market value of the recourse property ($280,000), less any higher ranking charges ($60,000).

The net market value of the recourse property is attributed to each of the owner guarantors to the extent of their ownership interest in the recourse property, or, where the limited recourse guarantee is provided by an owner's associate, to the extent of the associate's interests in the recourse property.

If there is more than one owner guarantor linked to, or using, the same recourse property for their guarantees, the net market value of the recourse property will be divided amongst the relevant owner guarantors.

##### Example 5 - Greenwich Ltd

Two brothers, Peter and Paul are the equal shareholders of Greenwich Ltd, a look-through company. Greenwich Ltd has a bank loan of $500,000.

Peter and Paul also own a holiday home, which currently has a net market value of $400,000. This holiday home is used as "recourse property" in guarantees provided by Peter and/or Paul for the bank loan.

If either Peter or Paul provides a guarantee for the bankloan, he will be an owner guarantor.

The secured amount that Peter and/or Paul may include in their owner's basis calculation will depend on who provides the limited recourse guarantee, and their ownership interests in the holiday home. For example, if the holiday home is owned by Peter and Paul as tenants-in-common, each will own a separate interest in the property, and they can only include the proportionate interest as a secured amount. If the holiday home is held as joint tenants, Peter and Paul have a shared interest in the whole of property, so it will simply be divided equally between them.

| Extent of interest in holiday home (recourse property) | Limited recourse guarantee(s) provided by | Number of owner guarantors | Amount included in owner's basis |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Peter** | **Paul** |
| Joint tenants | Peter | 1   | $400,000 | N/A |
| Paul | 1   | N/A | $400,000 |
| Peter and Paul | 2   | $200,000 | $200,000 |
| Tenants-in-common  <br>Peter's share = 40% | Peter | 1   | $160,000 | N/A |
| Paul | 1   | N/A | $240,000 |
| Paul's share = 60% | Peter and Paul | 2   | $160,000 | $240,000 |

#### Application date

The amendment applies from 1 April 2011.

#### Income

The income category of the owner's basis calculation includes the owner's share of the LTC's income, including exempt and excluded income, and capital gains from the current and any preceding tax years (in which the company was an LTC).

New section HB 11(7)(ab) provides for the owner's share of the LTC income to be increased where an owner's proportionate share of the dividend actually distributed by a foreign investment fund (FIF) to the LTC is higher than their amount of FIF income as calculated using the owner's chosen FIF calculation method. Any excess is added to the owner's "income" for the purposes of the owner's basis calculation. In the case of a FIF loss being calculated under the FIF rules but FIF dividends being received, the actual dividend amount will be counted.

This is achieved through the formula in section HB 11(7B):

*   _dividend \- FIF amount_

Where:

*   _dividend_ is the amount of the actual dividend received by the LTC from a FIF (ignoring section CD 36(1))  
    _FIF amount_ is the amount of the owner's FIF income for the relevant income year and FIF. If the owner has a FIF loss, the FIF amount is zero (see example 6c).

If the calculation under this formula produces a negative result, then there is no increase in the owner's basis for dividends received from a FIF (see example 6b).

##### Example 6

Tina is the sole owner of Button Ltd, a look-through company. Button Ltd derives gross trading income of $100 and also receives dividends from a foreign investment fund (FIF) of $20. There are no expenses. Tina selects the comparative value method for calculating her FIF income from her attributing FIF interests.

##### Example 6a - FIF income < dividend amount

Tina has FIF income of $5 for her interests in this attributing FIF, held via Button Ltd.

Under section HB 1, $105 of income is attributed to Tina from Button Ltd. This $105 is included in the "income" element of her owner's basis formula, in section HB 11(7)(a).

Tina is considered to be at economic risk for the full $20 FIF dividend received in that income year. Therefore the $15 difference between the actual dividend and the amount of FIF income calculated under the FIF rules is added to her owner's basis in section HB 11(7)(ab), through the formula in section HB 11(7B):  
_dividend - FIF amount =$20 - $5 = $15_

##### Example 6b - FIF income > dividend amount

The comparative value method for the attributing FIF interest gives Tina FIF income of $30.

No additional amount is included in Tina's owner's basis under section HB 11(7)(ab), because the result of the formula at HB 11(7B) would be negative, and so the result is restricted to zero.  
_dividend - FIF amount = $20 - $30 = -$10 (so restricted to zero)_

##### Example 6c - FIF loss

If Tina had a FIF loss, the "FIF amount" in the formula at HB 11(7B) would be zero; Tina would include the full amount of FIF dividends actually received in her owner's basis.  
_dividend - FIF amount = $20 - $0 = $20_

If an owner does not use the FIF rules, they will not have FIF income or a FIF loss. Instead any actual foreign dividends received will already be included as income under section HB 11(7)(a) and no adjustment will be necessary under  section HB 11(7)(ab).

_Application date_

The amendment applies from 1 April 2011.

#### QCs transitioning to LTC or LP rules - initial basis

When the LTC rules were introduced, special transitional rules were included for companies that were QCs or LAQCs in the income year immediately before the income year starting on or after 1 April 2011. These are designed to provide a smooth transition for existing QCs to start using the LTC rules if they wish to do so. There is also an option for a QC to transition its business structure into a limited partnership (LP).

After a transition to either an LTC or an LP, the shareholders of the former QC will need to apply the loss limitation rules to determine their owner's or partner's basis respectively. This will require them to determine the amount of equity they have in the LTC or LP. Under the special transitional rules their equity amount "at risk" includes any retained reserves built up during the company's pre-QC and QC years.

When a QC transitions to an LTC, shareholders need to make an initial valuation of their equity amount, that is, for the shares acquired during pre-transition. This is known as their initial basis, and is used in section HB 11(5)(a) in the transitional year, and in all future years.

So, for example, the reference in section HB 11(5)(a) to "the value of shares at the time the person purchases or subscribes for them" will be, for a shareholder in an LTC that has transitioned from being a QC, the value of his or her shares as determined under the initial basis calculation, in all future years when the shareholder applies section HB 11(5)(a) to those shares.

Likewise, for a transition to an LP, a limited partner must make an initial valuation of their equity contribution, which forms the starting point for determining the valuation of their "capital contribution" under section HG 11(5)(a) for all future years.

A shareholder in a transitioning QC has two options for determining their partner's or owner's initial basis under sections HZ 4B and HZ 4C respectively. They can use either:

*   the market value or the accounting book value of the relevant items on the last day of the income year before the QC transitions; or
*   the historic basis, as if the LP or LTC rules had always applied, and the LP or LTC  had always existed.

The "market value" and the "accounting book value" options in this method are broadly the same. However, under the former, shareholders need to obtain a formal market valuation of their shares.

Amendments have been made to the market value or the accounting book value methods of the initial basis calculation to clarify that:

*   The valuation of shares is used in determining the amount of an owner's or limited partner's "investments" under the loss limitation formula, for all relevant future years.
*   Any change in the value of assets included in the initial basis valuation of equity will be determined using this initial basis valuation, for the purposes of the loss limitation rules. For example, the calculation of a "capital gain" or "capital loss" via sections HB 11(7)(b) and HB 11(8)(b) (see example 7).
*   An initial basis calculation, under either the accounting book value or market value method applies only to shares or capital contributions included in the investments category of the loss limitation formula. It is not relevant to other items included in the investments category, such as loans and secured amounts where the valuation is likely to fluctuate each year.

##### Example 7 - Capital gains and capital losses

A QC transitions to an LTC. The owner's initial basis calculation under the accounting or market value method is:

|     | **Accounting book value** | **Market value** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _Shareholder equity_ |     |     |
| Paid-up capital | 1,000 | 1,000 |
| Retained earnings | 200 | 200 |
| Revaluation reserve | \-  | 30,000 |
| **Total equity** | 1,200 | 31,200 |
| _Net assets_ |     |     |
| Property | 50,000 | 50,000 |
| Revaluation | \-  | 30,000 |
| **Total assets** | 50,000 | 80,000 |
| Mortgage | \-30,000 | \-30,000 |
| Shareholder loan account | \-18,800 | \-18,800 |
| **Total liabilities** | \-48,800 | \-48,800 |
| _Net assets_ | 1,200 | 31,200 |

Using the accounting book value method would give $1,200 equity under the initial basis calculation.

The market value method would include $31,200 equity under the initial basis calculation (due to the revaluation of the property).

If the property was later sold for its revalued amount of $80,000, any capital gain or capital loss should be recognised under either the income or deductions category of the loss limitation formula (sections HB 11(7)(b) and HB 11(8)(b) respectively).

Under the accounting book value method, the property revaluation was not included in the initial basis. So when the property is sold for $80,000, the capital gain of $30,000 (determined as if realised under section CD 44(7)(a)) will be added to the owner's or partner's basis at that point (section HB 11 (7)(b)).

Under the market value method, the property was included in the initial basis calculation at $80,000, because the revaluation reserve was included. So when the property is later sold for $80,000 there will not be a capital gain to be included as income under section HB 11(7)(b), because the owner has counted the property reserve in his "base" cost. Or put another way, the capital gain computation undertaken solely for the purposes of the owner's basis formula will be nil ($80,000 disposal proceeds less $80,000 "cost"). If the property actually sells for more or less than $80,000, the capital gain or capital loss will be recognised under section HB 11(7)(b) or section HB 11(8)(b) respectively.

_Application date_

The amendment applies from 1 April 2011.

#### Limited partnerships

Amendments have been made to the "investment" and "income" categories of the calculation for a partner's basis in the limited partnership rules in section HG 11. These are broadly similar to the amendments to the LTC rules, which are discussed in detail above.

#### Investments - capital contribution

The definition of "capital contribution" has been amended to clarify that loans made by a limited partner to the limited partnership are counted as an investment under section HG 11(5)(a). This amendment clarifies the existing position.

_Application date_

The amendment applies from 1 April 2008.

#### Investments - secured amounts

Amendments have been made to the definition of "secured amounts", which mirror the amendments described above for LTCs.  
There are two points to note:

*   A general partner is only considered to be a guarantor of the partnership's debt under the new definition if the general partner provides a guarantee. The general partner is not otherwise considered to be a guarantor simply by being liable for the debt as a general partner.
*   The definition of "partner's associate" is a company in the same wholly owned group as the partner, and a relative of the partner. For the latter purpose, the definition of a "relative" excludes a trustee connected with the partner simply by being the trustee of a trust under which a relative of that partner has benefited or is eligible to benefit.

_Application date_

These amendments apply from 1 April 2012.

#### Income - FIF income and FIF loss

Amendments have been made to the income category of the partner's basis calculation, which mirror the amendments described above for LTCs.

_Application date_

These amendments apply from 1 April 2008, being the date on which the limited partnership rules first applied.

### LTC remedial amendments

#### Tax elections, and valuation and timing methods

Various provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 require elections to be made for a particular tax treatment for an asset or class of assets, or to apply a particular valuation method to certain assets. Elections relating to the assets of a company would usually be made by its director or other relevant officer.  
   
However, under the LTC rules, each owner is regarded as holding the company's assets directly, and carrying on the activities of the company. This could require each owner to make an election in respect of their portion of the LTC's assets.

New section HB 1(6) simplifies this administrative burden by providing that elections concerning the tax treatment of an LTC's income or property, or any valuation or timing methods adopted in relation to an LTC's income or property, are made or established by the LTC. The election, valuation method or timing method used by the LTC is binding on the owners in respect of their look-through interests in the LTC's property.

For example, section EE 8(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a person may elect to treat an item of depreciable property they acquire as not being depreciable property. When such an election is made for an item of depreciable property acquired by an LTC, the election will be made by the LTC. The consequences of that election on the LTCs allowable deductions will be reflected in the LTC's tax return, which will automatically flow through to the owners' tax returns.

Section HB 1(6) applies only to elections made, or valuation or timing methods adopted, in relation to an LTC's income or property.  It does not apply to a tax position taken by a shareholder. This is because tax positions will take into account a shareholder's interests outside of the LTC - for example, in determining whether the cost of a person's attributing interests in a foreign investment fund (FIF) are more than $50,000, for the purposes of applying section CQ 5 or section DN 6, attributing interests in a FIF that are held by the shareholder in a personal capacity, as well as their attributed interests via the LTC must be taken into account.

_Application date_

The amendment applies from 1 April 2011.

#### Aggregation of relatives' interests under the "look-through counted owner" definition

An LTC must have five or fewer "look-through counted owners". The shareholdings of look-through owners who are relatives are aggregated, and they are treated as one look-through counted owner.

The definition of "relative" in section YA 1 has been amended, for the purposes of determining the number of look-through counted owners, to exclude a person connected with another person simply by being the trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit.

_Application date_

The amendment applies from an LTC's first income year starting on or after 2 November 2012, being the date of Royal assent.

#### Benefits provided to an employee's associates

Under the LTC rules, a shareholder of an LTC may be treated as an employee for PAYE purposes, if he or she elects to be treated as a "working owner".

A working owner is not treated as an employee for fringe benefit tax (FBT) purposes. This is because the cost of providing fringe benefits and paying FBT is borne by the employer. Under the LTC tax transparency rules this would give all of the LTC's shareholders a deduction for the benefit provided to the "working owner" shareholder, which is, strictly, a distribution of profit and not a business expense.

Under section GB 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007, if a benefit is provided by an employer to a person who is associated with an employee, and the benefit would have been a fringe benefit if provided to the employee, the benefit is treated as provided by the employer to the employee for the purpose of the fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules.

Section GB 32 has been amended to ensure that it does not apply to a benefit provided by an LTC to one of its shareholders. This means that the benefit provided to the shareholder will not be treated as a fringe benefit of a (non-shareholder) employee who is associated with the shareholder.

Instead, the benefit provided by the LTC to the shareholder will be considered as a distribution of profits to that shareholder.

The amendment also applies to benefits provided to a partner by their partnership or limited partnership.

_Application date_

The amendment applies from 2 November 2012, being the date of Royal assent.

#### Qualifying company amalgamations

When the LTC rules were introduced, the QC rules in subpart HA of the Income Tax Act 2007 were grandparented so that only companies that were already QCs or LAQCs before 1 April 2011 could continue to use the QC rules. No new companies could start using the QC rules after 1 April 2011.

However, it was possible that in an amalgamation that was not a resident's amalgamation an ordinary company could amalgamate with a QC, and this amalgamation would effectively have enabled a new company to start using the QC rules after 1 April 2011.

Section HA 7B of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to ensure that a new company cannot enter into the QC rules through an amalgamation that is not a resident's amalgamation. The amended section means that following an amalgamation between a non-QC company and a QC, the resulting amalgamated company cannot use the QC rules.

_Application date_

The amendment applies to amalgamations on or after 2 November 2012, being the date of Royal assent.

#### GST group-filing rules

Under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, an LTC is generally regarded as a company and as the registered entity for GST purposes. The company is responsible for complying with any GST requirements, not each individual owner.

Section 55 of the GST Act has been amended to ensure that an LTC can also be regarded as a company in order to meet the "group of companies" requirements for GST group registration. This will reduce compliance costs for LTCs and their owners.

_Application date_

The amendment applies from 1 April 2011.
\[UNCLASSIFIE D\] Long-term insights briefing Our tax system: bases and regimes Consultation on the scope of Inland Revenue’s long-term insights briefing You can provide feedback on this consultation by emailing policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “LTIB topic” in the subject line. The closing date for feedback is 4October 2024. Environmental scan of our tax system To determine the topic of our next LTIB, Inland Revenueundertook an environmental scan of New Zealand’s tax system, how it compares to other countries’ tax systems, and potential future challenges. Key findings of the scan were: •The level of revenue that our tax system raises, relative to the size of the economy, is close to the OECD average. In common with other OECD countries,our system has two main bases: income and consumption. However, our system is unusual in not having significant specific taxes on labour income, such as social security contributions or payroll taxes. •Our tax system has been subject to several major reviews in recent decades. These reviews have noted the benefits of the broad-based low-rate approach to taxation that New Zealand has followed for many years. However, they have also identified tensions in the current system, including to do with the comprehensiveness of our income tax base and the interface of personal and entity tax regimes. •There are several trends that could have significant implications for our tax system in the future. The most relevant trend is that of increased fiscal pressures from superannuation and healthcare costs. Future governments will have the option to respond to these pressures by either changing legislative settings, managing expenditure growth, making greater use of user-pays mechanisms or increasing the amount of tax that is raised relative to GDP. We will have greater fiscal resilience if our tax system has flexibility to adapt to changing revenue needs over time. Topic of Inland Revenue’s next LTIB Based on the findings of our environmental scan, Inland Revenue is proposing that our next LTIB explores what broad structure of the tax system would be suitable for the future. This topic is motivated by two key issues touched on above, namely: how to design the tax system in the face of long-term fiscal pressures; and whether there are alternative ways to design our tax system that better address tensions identified by previous reviews. We intend to approach this topic by focusing on three key areas: •Tax bases and mixes. This would look at the economic factors (e.g. labour and capital income) that are being taxed by different tax bases, and the extent to which different bases tax similar economic factors. It would explore, among other things, the merits of alternative tax bases and tax base mixes, and the merits of raising revenue from new bases versus existing bases. It would consider whether it makes sense to add alternative bases to our current mix. •Income tax regimes. This would look at the broad rules for taxing income, including the ways in which individuals and entities are taxed and the integration of personal and entity taxation. It would explore ways to improve the income tax system, including by considering options for improving consistency in the tax treatment of different forms of income and the pros and cons of alternative approaches to taxing income such as those used in other countries. •Consumption tax regimes. This would look at the taxation of consumption through value added taxes (GST in New Zealand). It would look at ways to make consumption taxes take more account of distributional goals, including by looking at how other countries have provided GST offsets to those with low incomes to compensate for rate rises. Inland Revenue is consulting on the scope of our next long-term insights briefing (LTIB). This page provides a summary of the consultation. The full consultation document is available at taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/LTIB2. What is an LTIB? •LTIBs are future-focused think pieces that government departments produce every three years. They provide information on long-term trends, risks and opportunities that could affect New Zealand in the future, and policy options for responding to these matters. Their purpose is to help us collectively think about and plan for the future. •LTIBs are developed independently of ministers and are not current government p o l i c y. •LTIBs go through two rounds of public consultation during their development: first on the proposed topic of a briefing; and second on a full draft of a briefing. Inland Revenue is now consulting on the topic of its next briefing.

Inland Revenue, together with the Treasury, is responsible for providing advice to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue on the tax and social policies administered through the tax system. Given this responsibility, Inland Revenue has a stewardship role to ensure that it is well placed to advise present and future governments on tax and social policy concerns that are likely to be of interest to New Zealand in the future. 2. As part of carrying out its stewardship role, Inland Revenue, like other government departments, is required to produce a long-term insights briefing (LTIB) once every three years. LTIBs are intended to help us collectively as a country think about and plan for the future. They do this by identifying and exploring long-term issues that matter for our future wellbeing. Specifically, LTIBs are required to make publicly available: • information about medium- and long-term trends, risks and opportunities that affect or may affect New Zealand society, and • information and impartial analysis, including policy options for responding to the trends, risks and opportunities that have been identified. 3. Departments are required to undertake two rounds of public consultation in producing a LTIB. The first is on the LTIB’s topic. The second is on a draft of the LTIB. The topic of Inland Revenue’s first LTIB was “Tax, foreign investment and productivity” (Inland Revenue, 2022). 4. We are now consulting on the topic of our second LTIB. We are proposing that the LTIB explores what broad structure of the tax system would be suitable for the future. We would approach this topic by looking at our tax system through the lenses of tax bases and regimes. The topic name would be “Our tax system: Bases and regimes”. 5. We have developed the scope of this topic after undertaking an environmental scan of our current tax system, how it compares to the tax systems of other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the issues that are likely to affect our tax system in the future. The environmental scan is set out in chapters 1 and 2 of this consultation document. Chapter 3 then discusses the scope of our proposed LTIB topic. Environmental scan summary 6. The environmental scan notes that, i n common with other OECD countries, New Zealand’s tax system has two main bases: income and consumption. Within these bases, New Zealand has for many years followed a broad-based low-rate approach to taxation. This means that taxes are applied broadly with few exceptions, which allows a given amount of revenue to be raised at low tax rates. This approach has contributed to relatively stable tax settings over the last 40 years. 7. The environmental scan provides further detail on how New Zealand’s tax system compares to systems in other OECD countries. The level of tax revenue New Zealand raises, relative to the size of the economy, is close to the OECD average. In terms of the composition of tax revenue, New Zealand is unusual in the OECD in not having significant specific taxes on labour income, such as social security contributions or payroll taxes . Further, many OECD countries operate schedular taxation systems that tax capital income at lower rates than labour income. Consequently, most OECD countries have a higher tax burden on employee labour income than New Zealand. 5 New Zealand raises more than the OECD average in general consumption taxes, relative to GDP, through the goods and services tax (GST). However, New Zealand also raises less than the OECD average in specific consumption taxes, with the overall level of consumption taxation only slightly above the OECD average. In contrast, New Zealand has a higher company tax rate than the OECD average, and high effective marginal tax rates on inbound investments compared to other OECD countries. New Zealand also raises more than the OECD average from recurrent property taxes (through local government rates). 8. The environmental scan notes that New Zealand’s tax system has been subject to several major reviews in recent decades. These reviews have noted the benefits of New Zealand’s broad-based low-rate approach, in particular that it enables revenue to be raised at relatively low rates and according to a coherent framework. However, the reviews have also identified tensions in the current tax system, including around the comprehensiveness of our income tax bases, the interface of personal and entity tax regimes, and the best mix of tax bases for economic growth. Inland Revenue’s previous LTIB also noted that New Zealand’s high taxes on inbound investments have the potential to reduce New Zealand’s capital stock and labour productivity. 9. The environmental scan goes on to identify several long-term trends that could have significant implications for the future of New Zealand’s tax system. The main trends of relevance are increased government expenditure on superannuation if current legislative settings stay in place and pressure on healthcare costs from New Zealand’s ag eing population. Climate change also presents risks to New Zealand’s fiscal position. Future governments will have the option to respond to these pressures by either changing legislative settings, managing expenditure growth, making greater use of user-pays mechanisms or increasing the amount of tax that is raised relative to GDP. 10. Other trends identified include New Zealand’s low levels of productivity compared to OECD countries, as well as changes in technology, the impacts of artificial intelligence and changes in the nature of work. However, we do not plan to consider the latter trends in depth because the impacts on the tax system are uncertain or they are more directly relevant to tax administration, which we do not plan to consider in the LTIB. Proposed long-term insights briefing topic 11. Based on the findings of the environmental scan, we propose that Inland Revenue’s next LTIB explore what broad structure of the tax system would be suitable for the future. There are two key issues that motivate the choice of this topic. 12. The first is how to design the tax system in the face of long-term fiscal pressures. We do not assume that future revenue needs (relative to GDP) will increase. However, fiscal pressures give rise to a risk that revenue may need to be higher in the future to meet future expenditure. We propose that a key concept to motivate the LTIB is to consider how to maintain a stable core structure of the tax system while ensuring the system has flexibility to adapt to changing revenue needs over time. A stable core structure is important for providing certainty to taxpayers to help them make long- term decisions. However, our fiscal system will be more resilient if our tax system has the flexibility to raise different amounts of revenue as needed over time. 13. Flexibility can also be thought of in terms of the government’s distributional goals. Future governments will have different views on how to distribute the tax burden over time and will be willing to bear different levels of economic cost to meet those distributional objectives. A flexible tax system is one where changes can easily be made to the distribution of the tax burden while maintaining a stable core structure. 14. It might be thought that any tax system is inherently flexible because governments can change tax rates on existing bases at any time. However, there are significant 6 constraints on doing this for New Zealand’s current two main bases – income tax and GST. We discuss this in paragraph 18 below. 15. A second motivation for our proposed topic is to consider whether there are alternative approaches that may better address the tensions in the current system identified in the environmental scan. In considering these issues there are important trade-offs to be made between revenue integrity, efficiency and equity objectives. This motivation arises whether future revenue needs increase or not. 16. We propose to approach this topic by focusing on two elements of the tax system: the regimes through which we tax income and consumption, and our mix of tax bases. 17. The first question we will consider is what economic factors are taxed under the two main bases of our current tax system. Largely, we expect that taxes on income and consumption will remain the key revenue sources going forth, and so will continue to form the main part of our stable core tax structure. We will look at the arguments for the balance of taxation of income versus consumption, and the overlaps and differences between these bases. This question is relevant whether future revenue needs increase or not. 18. We will then look in depth at our main regimes for taxing income and consumption. One idea we propose is that a flexible tax system would be one under which governments could easily change tax rates to change the level of revenue generated or alter the distribution of the tax burden. As set out in chapter 3, we consider there are constraints on being able to do this currently. In particular: • New Zealand’s main income tax regimes are the personal income tax, corporate tax, portfolio investment entity and trust regimes. The design of these regimes balances trade-offs between revenue sufficiency, efficiency or productivity and fairness. These trade-offs mean that we do not assume that top personal and entity tax rates under these regimes will necessarily be aligned in the future tax system. In particular, setting the company tax rate too high may restrict foreign investment in a way that lowers the income of New Zealanders. If we maintained or lowered the company tax rate, while increasing personal rates, we would create significant opportunities to shelter income in companies. These issues make our income tax system relatively inflexible as a way of responding to increased revenue needs or calls for a more progressive tax system. Therefore, a key question we propose to consider is how the income tax regimes can be made more flexible to meet different revenue needs, or distributional goals, over time. • New Zealand’s main consumption tax is its broad-based GST. Because GST is applied at a flat rate to expenditure, raising the rate leads to concerns about the impact on low-income households. This is likely to reduce the flexibility of raising GST to respond to long-term fiscal pressures and is a reason to consider measures that could sit alongside a GST increase and reduce the impact of rate increases on low-income households. To do this, we will look at the literature on progressive consumption taxes, including looking at how other countries have provided low- income offsets to compensate for GST rate rises. 19. We will also look at tax bases other than income and consumption. This is worth understanding because fiscal pressures mean that different possible tax bases are likely to be contemplated over the long term. A key consideration is understanding the relative merits of introducing new tax bases versus raising rates on existing bases to meet potential increased revenue needs. Even if future revenue needs do not increase, an important question is whether our current mix of bases is the best to meet efficiency and fairness objectives – that is, whether we have the right mix of bases for our stable core structure. 7 20. To understand this, we will consider the differences and overlaps between our current bases and alternative bases including considering the pros and cons of taxes on payroll, land, wealth and inheritances. 21. We intend to focus on taxes that are aimed at raising revenue and not on taxes that are aimed at other objectives, such as corrective taxes like environmental taxes. Corrective taxes raise a range of issues that are different to those raised by revenue raising taxes and are a large topic in themselves. Further, environmental taxes were recently considered in depth by the last Tax Working Group. 22. In line with the purpose of the LTIB, our proposed topic is meant to promote public discussion on policy choices. It does not seek to identify immediate actions or make recommendations, but instead focuses on the pros and cons of alternative approaches. How to make a submission 23. We are seeking your feedback on the scope of the proposed topic of our next LTIB as outlined in this document. We provide the following questions to guide responses: • Does the environmental scan identify the key challenges facing our tax system over the long term? • How well positioned is our current tax system to respond to these challenges? • Do you agree with the focus on how to maintain a stable core structure of the tax system while ensuring the system has flexibility to adapt to different revenue and distributional objectives over time? • Do you agree that understanding the pros and cons of different approaches to income and consumption tax is important for understanding what tax system would be suitable for the future? • Do you agree that we should consider what is taxed under our current main two bases, and if there are any bases it makes sense to add to our tax mix? • Do you think we should consider both options for a future tax system that may have higher revenue needs and options at current revenue levels? 24. The closing date for submissions is 4 October 2024. Submissions may be made by: • email to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “LTIB topic” in the subject line, or • by post to: LTIB topic, c/ - Chief Economist, Policy | Taukaea Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 25. Please indicate if we can contact you to discuss the points raised in your submission. 26. Submissions may be published on our website and may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982. If you consider that any part of your submission should not be released, please clearly indicate this including any withholding grounds under the Official Information Act 1982. 27. There will be a further opportunity to provide feedback when Inland Revenue releases a draft of its second LTIB for public consultation. The LTIB will then be finalised and provided to the House of Representatives in mid- to late-2025. 8 CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF OUR TAX SYSTEM Introduction 28. New Zealand’s tax system provides the main source of revenue for public services, such as our health and education systems. It is essential to our collective wellbeing. We collect around a third of gross domestic product (GDP) in tax, so how our tax system is structured also has significant economic impacts. 29. New Zealand’s tax system has two main tax bases: income and consumption. This is also true of other OECD countries if labour income taxes are considered as an income tax. For these two tax bases, New Zealand has for many years followed a broad-based low-rate approach to taxation – that is, one where taxes are applied broadly with few exceptions which allows a given amount of revenue to be raised at low rates. 30. This chapter of the consultation document describes the key features of New Zealand’s tax system and how it compares to other OECD countries’ systems. It also provides, in box 2, a summary of key issues raised in past reviews of New Zealand’s tax system. Chapter 2 discusses trends that are relevant to the tax system over the long term. New Zealand’s tax system Tax as a proportion of the economy 31. In New Zealand, taxes are mainly levied at the central government level. Local government levies “rates” based on property values to fund certain local expenditures. Central and local government together are known as “general government”. Graphs in this section on New Zealand’s tax system are for central government. They present consolidated core Crown tax revenue from the 1993–94 June year. 1 Prior to this, they present total Crown receipts. 2 32. In the year ended June 2023, consolidated core Crown tax revenue as a proportion of GDP was 28.4%. Tax revenue is the main source of central government revenue, constituting 91% of core Crown revenue in the year ended June 2023. 33. The amount of tax collected as a proportion of GDP has varied over time due to both policy changes and economic factors, such as changes in GDP. Figure 1 shows that core Crown tax revenue as a proportion of GDP has varied around 7 percentage points over the last 30 years, varying between 25% and 31.8%. 1 Consolidated tax revenue excludes tax paid by government entities within the accounting unit. The core Crown is an accounting unit of central government. Crown entities and State-Owned Enterprises are not part of core Crown. Core Crown has been a concept used since the 1993–94 year; prior to that total Crown is used. 2 Prior to the 1993–94 year, the official tax series was only based on tax receipts (that is, a cash measure). A revenue-based measure was adopted from the 1993–94 year. Years in the graphs refer to the June year end. 9 Figure 1: Core Crown tax revenue as a percent of GDP, 1994–2023 Source: The Treasury, Fiscal Time Series Historical Indicators, 2024 New Zealand’s tax bases 34. Figure 2 shows that over 90% of core Crown tax revenue is sourced from the two main bases of income tax (from individuals and companies) and GST. On a consolidated basis, direct taxes on individuals 3 provide about twice as much revenue as GST. 35. Other indirect taxes, such as excise taxes and duties, constitute around 6% of core Crown tax revenue. New Zealand does not have inheritance or estate taxes , or land tax at the central government level. 36. At the general government level, local government rates are around 5.5% of general government tax revenue, or 1.9% of GDP. 3 Tax on individuals includes personal income tax and some other taxes such as taxes paid by trusts, Māori authorities and partnerships, fringe benefit tax (except for 1989–90) and resident withholding tax. It is adjusted for donations tax credits and the independent earner tax credit and rebates. 28.4 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 199419951996199719981999200020012002200320042005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017201820192020202120222023 Revenue (% of GDP) 10 Figure 2: Sources of revenue as a percent of core Crown tax revenue, 2023 Source: The Treasury, Tax Outturn Data, 2024 37. Figure 3 shows the change in the central government tax mix (as a proportion of GDP) since the 1980s when New Zealand’s tax system was significantly reformed . It shows that income tax from individuals, relative to GDP, declined in the 1980s and 1990s following reforms. Income tax from individuals declined again following personal tax rate decreases in 2010 but increased after that due to a combination of nominal wage growth and the increase in the top personal tax rate to 39% from April 2021. 38. Figure 3 also shows the effects of the introduction of GST in place of sales tax on 1 October 1986, initially at a rate of 10% but raised to 12.5% in 1989 and 15% in 2010. As a proportion of GDP, sales tax or GST has increased from around 3% of GDP in the early 1980s to around 7% now. 39. Company, or corporate, taxes are a relatively volatile revenue source. 4 As a percent of GDP, company taxes are around double what they were in the 1980s. 40. A central government land tax was in place until the 1990s but did not raise much revenue in this period. There was an estate duty until the 1990s 5 ; this however raised very little revenue by the 1980s and 1990s. In figure 3, the property taxes line consolidates central government land tax and estate and gift duty. 4 Company tax in these calculations includes net tax on companies, portfolio investment entities, unit trusts, superannuation funds, clubs and societies, and Crown entities, as well as qualifying company election tax, non- resident withholding tax, dividend withholding tax and foreign dividend withholding payments. 5 Gift duty was in place until 2011. 11 Figure 3: Sources of central government tax revenue as a percent of GDP, 1979–2023 6 Source: Stats NZ & The Treasury, 2024 7 41. The reforms in the 1980s were aimed at broadening the income and consumption tax bases to reduce the economic distortions created by the tax system, reduce compliance and administrative costs and improve the ability of the government to meet its revenue requirements. 42. Prior to these reforms, New Zealand’s tax system relied heavily on the personal income tax system. Figure 4 shows that in 1979 income tax on individuals constituted 65.1% of central government revenue, as opposed to 51.4% in 1995, 48.8% in 2011 and 51.6% in 2023. The sales tax in place prior to the introduction of GST had many exemptions and a number of rates applying to different goods. With its narrow base and the exclusion of services, which represented a growing part of the economy, the sales tax was not capable of generating significant revenue. 43. The introduction of GST significantly broadened the consumption tax base and resulted in a significant increase in the share of tax revenue from general consumption taxes from 9.0 % of central government tax revenue in 1979 to 22.5% in 1995 and 25.0 % in 2023 (on a consolidated basis). 6 Data in figures 3 and 4 are total Crown tax receipts until year ended June 1993 and then core Crown consolidated tax revenue. 7 Data for figures 3 and 4 are taken from Stats NZ’s official yearbook for the years 1979–1990 and the Treasury’s tax outturn data for the years 1991–2023. 14.7 7.1 5.0 1.7 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 19791981198319851987198919911993199519971999200120032005200720092011201320152017201920212023 Revenue (% of GDP) Individuals tax GST orsales tax Company tax Other indirect taxes Property taxes 12 Figure 4: Sources of revenue as a percent of central government tax revenue Source: Stats NZ & The Treasury, 2024 44. From a longer-term perspective, New Zealand has had different bases and different mixes of bases over time. In the early part of the 20 th century customs and excise duties were an important source of revenue (being 74% of central government revenue in 1903). Up until the 1990s New Zealand had a central government land tax and estate duty. New Zealand also had a social security tax between 1930 and 1969. Figure 5 shows the share of central government revenue from different tax bases from 1922 to 2022 and box 1 provides more detail on New Zealand’s historical tax bases. Figure 5: Sources of revenue as a percent of central government tax revenue Source: Stats NZ & The Treasury, 2024 8 8 Data for figure 5 is taken from Stats NZ’s official yearbook for the years 1922–1990 and the Treasury’s tax outturn data for the years 1991–2023. 65% 51% 49% 52% 8% 14% 15% 17% 9% 23% 27% 25% 16% 12% 10% 6% 1% 1979199520112023 Individuals taxCompany taxGST & sales taxOther indirect taxesProperty taxes 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 19221932194219521962197219821992200220122022 Revenue (% of central government tax revenue) Customs and excise dutiesLand taxEstate and gift dutySales tax (GST from 1987) Social security taxIndividuals income taxCompany taxOther taxes 13 Box 1: Historical changes in the composition of New Zealand’s tax base Customs and excise duties Duties on alcohol, tobacco, tea, sugar, grains and other products were easy to collect in the early 1900s and were a main source of government revenue until the First World War. The fairness of these taxes was often contested and over time they were scaled back and replaced by more progressive and broad-based forms of taxation. Land tax A central government land tax was first introduced in 1891. There was initially both an “ordinary” and a “graduated” land tax: the graduated land tax was imposed at progressively higher rates depending on the value of the estate. It was seen as both an economic tool to incentivise land development, and a social tool to help break up large estates and prevent the “landlordism” seen in Britain at the time. (Absentee landlords paid a further surcharge.) It was an important revenue source for many years. Difficult economic conditions in the 1930s and 1940s saw revenue drop as land values fell. Affordability problems arose because the tax was not based on cash flows. Exemptions and concessions accumulated, and obtaining accurate and timely valuations represented an ongoing challenge. Eventually the land tax came to be perceived as “discriminatory, illogical and unequal” (New Zealand Parliamentary Debates, 1967). Through the 1950s and 1960s the tax was gradually rolled back until eventually it was applied only to commercial property. Governments were unwilling to forgo the revenue entirely however and an overhaul was attempted in 1989. This failed to fix the fundamental problems and political opposition continued to grow. Abolition was announced in 1990. Estate and gift duties Estate duties were first introduced in 1866, and gift duties followed shortly afterward to prevent people avoiding estate duties. Revenue from estate duties was slightly above 10% of the central government tax take at their peak. In 1949 the government began slowly narrowing the scope of the tax. Estate planning became more sophisticated, and anti- avoidance measures did not keep up (Littlewood, 2012). Revenue dwindled to negligible levels. Estate duties were eventually abolished in 1993. Gift duty was retained for a time to support social assistance targeting but was eventually retired with effect from October 2011. Social security tax The first social security tax was the unemployment levy enacted in 1930 to help pay for the costs of unemployment relief during the Depression. This was initially implemented as a fixed annual charge (a poll tax) on men of working age, but in 1931 the annual charge was lowered and supplemented by a 5% flat tax levied on wages and other income. The levy stayed in place through the 1930s. In 1940 there was an expansion of social security benefits (now including superannuation), and the levy was renamed the social security tax. A temporary increase in the tax during World War Two paved the way for a further expansion of benefits, with the levy settling at 7.5% in 1947. Income from the levy contributed to the current costs of social security, with the balance of costs met from the Consolidated Fund. Contributions were not set aside to fund future costs. In the 1960s the Social Security Fund merged with the Consolidated Fund. There was a gradual move away from a flat social security tax to a more progressive levy structure, and in 1969 the social security tax was fully replaced by income tax. 14 Tax regimes 45. By tax regimes we mean the rules for taxing the bases that are taxed. As noted, our main bases are income and consumption. This section discusses the main regimes applying to income and consumption. 46. Consumption is taxed through GST. GST is a value added tax (VAT) levied on sellers of goods and services. This means that it is applied at each stage of the supply chain and sellers can claim credits for GST on their inputs. In this way, the final consumer pays GST on the final price. Value added taxes differ from sales taxes in that the latter are assessed and paid only at the end of the supply chain. 47. In New Zealand, GST is levied at a flat rate of 15% (on the pre-GST price) and is applied to most goods and services. There are some expenditure types that do not have GST directly applied to them including rent, airfares for overseas travel and mortgage payments. Given its broad base, New Zealand’s GST imposes a tax burden broadly proportional to the expenditure of households of different income levels. In contrast, other countries often exempt goods and services that are considered necessities, such as certain food categories, which can result in a slight degree of progressivity, relative to expenditure, in other countries’ VAT systems. 9 48. New Zealand’s income tax is more complicated but can be grouped into four broad income tax regimes: personal, company, portfolio investment entity (PIE) and trusts. Each of the entity regimes (company, PIE and trusts) is designed to be integrated into the personal tax regime to some extent. This is so that as much income as possible is taxed according to the personal tax scale. However, the approach to integration differs in each case and, in each case, there is less than full integration. We describe each of these income tax regimes below. 49. The personal tax regime taxes individuals following a progressive income tax scale. Under this tax scale, marginal tax rates increase in steps as income increases. As discussed below, this results in increasing average tax rates across the income distribution (that is, an increasing amount of tax paid relative to income as income increases). The personal tax system is the main way that progressivity is provided in the tax system. Table 1 shows the marginal tax rates and thresholds that applied up to 30 July 2024, and the rates and thresholds applying from 31 July 2024. Table 1: Income tax scale Taxable income Statutory tax rate Up to 30 July 2024 From 31 July 2024 $1–$14,000 $1–$15,600 10.5% $14,001–$48,000 $15,601–$53,500 17.5% $48,001–$70,000 $53,501–$78,100 30% $70,001–$180,000 $78,101–$180,000 33% Over $180,000 Over $180,000 39% 9 Thomas (2020) found a small degree of regressivity in the GST-to-expenditure ratio in New Zealand given that exempt categories tend to benefit higher income/expenditure households. 15 50. Income taxed at personal tax rates includes income from employment (including wages, salary and self-employment income), and income from businesses , such as partnerships, that is attributed directly to individuals. It also includes distributed capital income such as interest, dividends and rent. New Zealand’s personal income tax does not distinguish between capital and labour income. As discussed later, some other countries tax these forms of income at different rates or include additional taxes on labour income in the form or payroll taxes or social security contributions. 51. Companies are taxed at a rate of 28% on their taxable income. Distributed income (dividends) is subject to tax at the shareholder’s individual marginal tax rate under the personal tax system. The imputation system operates to ensure that income that is distributed to shareholders is taxed at personal rates. When income is distributed, an imputation credit is given for the company tax paid on the income. Under the regime, company tax will normally be a final tax for foreign shareholders. 10 Unit trusts are also taxed at the company rate. 52. The rules for taxing Māori authorities use similar principles, with tax being applied to Māori authority taxable income at the rate of 17.5%, which represents the assumed marginal rate for individual members of a Māori authority. 11 As with companies, shareholders are taxed on dividends at their marginal tax rate, with a Māori authority credit (similar to an imputation credit) given for tax paid by the Māori authority. 53. A portfolio investment entity (PIE) is an entity that invests the contributions from its investors in different types of passive investment. Companies, trusts and superannuation schemes can become PIEs. PIE income is taxed according to the personal tax rate scale, however the maximum rate that PIE income can be taxed at is 28%. Because a PIE may be a company or a unit trust, the top PIE rate is aligned to the company tax rate. 54. The fourth income tax regime is trusts. Trustee income (that is, income taxable to the trust) is taxed at a flat rate. This is 39% for trusts with income over $10,000 and 33% otherwise. The two rates were introduced to ensure that most trustee income is taxed at the top marginal rate while also minimising the risk of over-taxation for trusts with lower rate beneficiaries. Beneficiary income (that is, income vested in or paid to the beneficiary within a year of it being earned by the trust) is generally taxed at the marginal tax rate of the trust’s beneficiary. Progressivity, incidence and fiscal drag 55. As noted above, progressivity is largely provided through the personal tax system (which also taxes distributions from entities) through marginal tax rates for personal income increasing at defined thresholds in the personal tax schedule (see table 1). This results in the average tax rate on individuals’ personal income (that is, total tax paid relative to total income) increasing as income increases. 56. Inflation can change the level of progressivity of the tax and transfer system over time in ways that were not intended by the government. In relation to personal tax, when the marginal tax rate thresholds are kept constant over time, while individuals’ incomes increase due to inflation or increases in real wages, more income will be taxed at higher marginal tax rates resulting in a higher proportion of income being paid in tax. This is known as fiscal drag. 10 Depending on the location of the non-resident and their level of shareholding, a distribution of income that was not taxed at the company level may be subject to non-resident withholding tax. 11 The term “Māori authority” is a tax-specific term. It applies to companies or trustees of a trust that manage communally owned assets whose ownership and administration are subject to certain statutory restrictions or government processes. 16 57. Figure 6 plots the statutory marginal tax rates in 2012 and 2022 (teal lines) and the resulting statutory average tax rates in 2012 and 2022 – that is, the average tax rate for a given level of income (orange lines). The ruby and blue lines show the distribution of income in 2012 and 2022. Figure 6 shows that between 2012 and 2022, there was a general increase in salary and wages resulting in more people having a higher average tax rate. This is shown by the shift in the distribution of incomes from 2012 to 2022 (ruby to blue line). As a result, the average tax rate for a worker earning the median salary or wages was 14.6% in 2012, which increased to 16.4% in 2022. Figure 6: Impact of fiscal drag, 2012 and 2022 Source: Inland Revenue calculations 58. Overall, however, it is the total impact of the tax system, the transfer system and government expenditure that determines the total quantity of redistribution from government action (the public finance mix). Fiscal incidence studies seek to measure the combined impact of all these government interactions. Studies in New Zealand have done this by: • taking households’ market income (from wages, salaries, self-employment, investments, gifts and inheritances) • adding income from government transfers (superannuation, working age income support and other transfers/tax credits) to get gross income • subtracting direct income tax (and Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) levies) on market income and transfers to get disposable income • subtracting indirect taxes on consumption expenditure (GST and excise taxes) and adding in the cash value of in-kind benefits from health and education services (this means around 60%–70% of core Crown expenditure is included). This gives final income. 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 0 20,000 40,000 60,000 80,000 100,000 120,000 0 10,00020,00030,00040,00050,00060,00070,00080,00090,000 100,000110,000120,000130,000140,000150,000160,000170,000180,000190,000200,000 Tax rate Number of taxpayers Annual wage/salary (dollars) Marginal rate 2012 Marginal rate 2022 Average rate 2022 Average rate 2012 2022 distribution 2012 distribution 17 59. The New Zealand Treasury’s latest fiscal incidence study is for the year 2018–19 (Nguyen & Wright, 2024). It shows the distribution of the level of direct and indirect taxes (GST and excises), income support and in-kind benefits (from health and education expenditure) across household disposable income deciles (that is, dividing the population into ten income groups and providing the average value for each group). The distribution of the average level of direct taxes is skewed towards higher-income households (grey bars in figure 7). By contrast, the average value of indirect taxes is more evenly distributed across the population, due to GST being levied at a flat rate relative to expenditure (teal bars in figure 7). 60. Average transfers are larger for lower income deciles, with income support (excluding superannuation) being insignificant for deciles nine and ten on average (taupe bars). Average New Zealand Superannuation (including veterans’ pensions) payments are highest in the second decile but remain significant at high deciles (blue bars). Deciles one to five show positive values of average net fiscal impact (dots) whereas the highest four deciles show negative values of average net fiscal impact. Figure 7: Average taxes and government expenditure over household disposable income deciles, 2019 Source: Nguyen & Wright, 2024 61. The authors calculate the impact of each government intervention on income inequality through measuring the Gini coefficient (scaled by a factor of 100) and how it changes with each government intervention. The Gini ranges from 0 to 100, with values closer to 0 representing higher equality. 12 A caveat is that the Gini is calculated relative to annual income, and so does not take account of savings shifting income and consumption over time periods. Studies calculated over longer periods of time tend to show a more equal distribution of income. 12 The Treasury fiscal incidence study calculates the Gini based on individual incomes. For each income definition they equivalise the income of each household, assign the equivalised value to each individual in the household, and calculate the Gini coefficient of the resulting distribution of incomes over individuals in the Household Economic Survey sample. -100,000 -50,000 0 50,000 12345678910All Average benefit or tax ($) Household equivalised disposable income decile Direct taxIndirect taxIncome support (excl super)SuperannuationIn-kind"Net Impact" 18 62. In the Treasury’s fiscal incidence study, the initial market income Gini is 45.6, as shown in figure 8. Moving to gross income, income support (including superannuation) payments reduce the Gini by 9.7 points. Moving to disposable income, direct taxes reduce the Gini by another 2.7 points. This means the change in Gini from market to disposable income is 12.4 points. Consumption taxes increase the annual income Gini by 1. 7 points. This is because consumption taxes are a larger share of the annual income of lower income deciles. Finally, government expenditure on health and education reduces the Gini by 6.8 points. The final income Gini is 28. 63. This illustrates the importance of government expenditure in reducing income inequality with the tax system also playing an important but smaller role. Similar to other OECD countries, transfers are larger than taxes in the reduction of the Gini from market income to disposable income. Figure 8: Decomposition of changes in Gini coefficient, 2019 Source: Nguyen & Wright, 2024 64. There are several difficulties in comparing Ginis across countries, such as different definitions of income and differences in the age structure of countries. However, OECD data suggests that the reduction in Gini from market to disposable income (that is, taking account of income support and direct taxes) for New Zealand is towards the middle of the spectrum for OECD countries. Countries with higher tax-to-GDP ratios, such as Finland, France and Belgium, show the largest fall in Gini from market to disposable income (being in excess of 20 points). In contrast, countries with a low tax- to-GDP ratio, such as Mexico, Chile and Costa Rica, show the smallest fall in Gini from market to disposable income (being below 10 points). For New Zealand, the fall in Gini from market to disposable income appears to be similar to that of Australia (being in the range of a reduction of 12–13 points over recent years). 19 Box 2: Reviews of New Zealand’s tax system New Zealand’s tax system has been subject to three reviews in the last 25 years. This includes the McLeod Review in 2001, the Victoria University of Wellington (VUW) Review in 2010 and the Tax Working Group (TWG) in 2019. Further, in 2022 Inland Revenue published its first LTIB on Tax, Productivity and Foreign Investment. The main issues raised in these reviews are listed below. Comprehensiveness of income tax: All three reviews discussed gaps in income taxation, particularly income arising from capital gains, as a notable way that the income tax is not comprehensive. As discussed in the next section, New Zealand is unusual in not having a general approach to taxing capital gains – although many capital gains are captured in ordinary income. However, views have been divided on the extent of any problems this causes and the best solution. Interface of personal and entity regimes: The McLeod and VUW reviews were concerned with the interface between the personal tax system and entity taxation. One principle that our current tax system is arguably built on is that income, no matter how earned, should be taxed as close to the personal marginal tax rate of the individual earning the income as possible. As noted earlier, currently top personal rates are higher than the company and PIE rate, which results in income earned through entities not always being taxed at close to personal tax rates. The best tax mix for economic growth: Both the McLeod and VUW reviews considered arguments about the appropriate mix of tax bases, particularly the best mix of income versus consumption taxes. The VUW review, for example, argued that income taxes are more harmful to economic growth than consumption taxes. There are long- standing debates in the economics literature as to the best mix of consumption and income taxes. Impact of tax on the quantity of investment: As New Zealand’s investment needs exceed its savings, foreign investment supports growth of the capital stock, which supports productivity and higher wages. Inland Revenue’s 2022 LTIB suggests that New Zealand has relatively high costs of capital (the cost of capital is the minimum real pre- tax rate of return for an investment to be profitable after-tax) and effective marginal tax rates on inbound investment compared to other OECD countries (see figure 18). This means that investments that would be profitable in other countries may not be profitable in New Zealand due to the tax cost. Impact of tax on the quality of investment: The 2022 LTIB also suggested there can be considerable variability in costs of capital of different investment types, particularly at higher inflation rates and to the extent that tax depreciation diverges from economic depreciation. This suggests that New Zealand’s tax settings are likely to influence the type of investments undertaken, which may have economic costs if it results in investment not being directed to projects with the highest return. Taxation of savings: A related issue is the different tax treatment of different forms of savings by domestic residents. Analysis by the TWG suggested that features of the tax system create biases as to where savings are allocated. These features include the PIE regime capping the taxation of income in PIEs at 28%, differences in the taxation of foreign shares compared to domestic shares and the non-taxation of some capital gains. Further, taxation of the inflation component of the return to savings can create biases. 20 Comparison to other countries’ tax systems 65. This section looks at how New Zealand’s tax system compares to the tax systems in other OECD countries. The analysis is generally based on data in the OECD’s global revenue statistics database. 13 To enable international comparability, the analysis uses OECD data at the general government level (that is, including both central and local government). This means that data for New Zealand includes local government rates. In this section, “tax revenue” refers to general government tax revenue. 66. Further, the OECD’s data is calculated on an unconsolidated basis, meaning that it includes taxes paid by the government. This significantly affects the OECD’s data for New Zealand because New Zealand is unusual among OECD countries in charging GST on public services. In addition, New Zealand taxes its sovereign wealth fund (the New Zealand Superannuation Fund (NZSF)), whereas such funds are often untaxed in other countries. Therefore, we have adjusted the OECD’s figures for New Zealand to exclude GST on public services, to the extent it is likely to result in an artificially high ratio for New Zealand, and tax paid by the NZSF. 14 These adjusted figures are presented in the charts as “New Zealand (ad)”. Years in the graphs refer to the December year end. Tax as a proportion of the economy 67. New Zealand raises a similar level of tax revenue as a proportion of its economy compared to the OECD average. Figure 9 shows that, in 2021, New Zealand’s tax revenue as a proportion of GDP was 34.6% when including all taxes paid by the government and 33. 3% when using adjusted figures, compared to the OECD average of 34.2%. Figure 9: General government tax revenue as a percent of GDP, 2021 Source: OECD, 2024 13 Data for figures 9 to 19 and 21 were taken from the OECD’s database retrieved from https://stats.oecd.org. 14 For GST, we have removed GST relating to the salary and wage component of the funding of government departments and Crown entities. This is because in countries that do not apply GST (VAT) to public services, government expenditure on public services will generally include the amount of VAT that applies to third-party supplies to the public entity. Note, the NZSF adjustment is immaterial for 2021 at 0.01% of GDP. 33.3 34.2 34.6 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Mexico Colombia Ireland Chile Turkey Costa Rica United States Switzerland Australia South Korea Latvia Lithuania Israel New Zealand (ad) Estonia Hungary Canada Japan OECD average United Kingdom New Zealand Czech Republic Iceland Portugal Slovakia Poland Spain Slovenia Luxembourg Netherlands Germany Greece Italy Norway Belgium Sweden Finland AustriaFrance Denmark Revenue (% of GDP) 21 68. Figure 10 shows that New Zealand’s level of tax revenue as a proportion of its economy has largely tracked changes in the OECD average over time. The OECD average proportion moved from 24.9% of GDP in 1965 to 34.2% in 2021. Over the same period, New Zealand’s proportion moved from 24.5% to 34.6% on an unadjusted basis. Figure 10: General government tax revenue as a percent of GDP, 1965–2021 15 Source: OECD, 2024 Tax bases in OECD countries 69. New Zealand is similar to other OECD countries in sourcing most of its revenue from total taxes on income and from general consumption taxes. We define total taxes on income to include individual and corporate income taxes 16 (which exist in all OECD countries) as well as social security contributions (SSCs) and payroll taxes (which exist in many other countries, but only in the form of ACC levies in New Zealand 17 ). General consumption taxes include value added taxes (like GST in New Zealand) and sales taxes (like those in the United States). 70. Figure 11 shows that, in 2021, the combined revenue from total taxes on income and general consumption taxes ranged from 74.1 % to 91.1 % of tax revenue across the OECD. New Zealand’s proportion was near the top of this range at 87. 4% (when adjusted for GST on public services and tax paid by the NZSF), above the OECD average of 83.4 %. As noted in paragraph 65, these figures are at the general government level (including local government rates in the denominator). 15 Figure 10 shows the level of tax-to-GDP for all current OECD members. The maximum and minimum lines show the highest and lowest level of tax-to-GDP in any country each year. The graph is based on data available in the OECD’s database, which does not include data for every country in every year. 16 The OECD’s classification of corporate income taxes includes taxes levied on the net income or profits, and the capital gains, of corporate enterprises. 17 ACC levies meet the OECD’s definition of SSCs. ACC levy revenue is only 1% of GDP. ACC levies are not included in the OECD’s data for New Zealand to ensure consistency with countries that have compulsory work- related private insurance to cover accidents and occupational diseases. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 196519721979198619932000200720142021 Revenue (% of GDP) OECD maximumOECD averageOECD minimumNew Zealand 22 Figure 11: Sources of revenue as a percent of general government tax revenue, 2021 Source: OECD, 2024 71. Since 1990, revenue from income taxes 18 as a proportion of general government tax revenue has varied between 53.0 % and 63.0 % in New Zealand, and 32.2 % and 36.2 % on average across the OECD. Over the same period, the revenue share of general consumption taxes has increased in New Zealand (from 22.4% in 1990 to 29.3% in 2021 when including all GST on public services) and on average across the OECD (from 18.5% in 1990 to 21.4% in 2021), while the revenue share of specific consumption taxes, such as excises, has declined in New Zealand and on average across the OECD. 72. Figure 11 shows the composition of tax revenue in a country by looking at revenue from different tax sources as a proportion of total general government tax revenue. However, this does not give an indication of the total level of revenue raised relative to the size of the economy. Looking at tax sources relative to GDP takes account of differences in tax-to-GDP ratios between countries rather than just the composition of revenue. 73. Focusing on total taxes on income, New Zealand raises a similar level of revenue, relative to GDP, from these taxes compared to the OECD average. Figure 12 shows New Zealand raised 20.2% of GDP from these taxes in 2021 (or 21.2% when including ACC levies), compared to the OECD average of 21.4% of GDP. 74. As discussed, we define total taxes on income to comprise income taxes (on individuals and corporates), SSCs and payroll taxes. For these components, figure 12 shows that New Zealand sources a relatively high amount of revenue, relative to GDP, from income taxes on individuals and corporates compared to other OECD countries. However, many other countries raise significant revenue from SSCs and payroll taxes; with many OECD countries raising more than a quarter of tax revenue from these taxes. SSCs and payroll taxes have a similar effect to income taxes on wages and salaries, although they are generally linked to an entitlement to receive a future social benefit. 18 Here we are referring to income taxes on individuals and corporates and excluding SSCs and payroll taxes. 23 Figure 12: Income tax, SSC and payroll tax revenue as percent of GDP, 2021 Source: OECD, 2024 75. Individual income taxes apply to both labour and capital income, whereas SSCs and payroll taxes only apply to labour income. Corporate income taxes apply to capital income, which may be earned by domestic residents or non-residents, but also some labour income, particularly for small- and medium-sized enterprises. The fact that, when combining income taxes, SSCs and payroll taxes, New Zealand raises a similar level of tax-to-GDP to the OECD average, despite New Zealand not having significant SSCs or payroll taxes, suggests that New Zealand may be imposing relatively high taxes on at least some forms of capital income and relatively low taxes on at least some forms of labour income compared to other OECD countries. 76. We can explore this further by looking at taxes on labour income in isolation. The OECD’s annual publication Taxing Wages measures the average labour tax wedge, calculated as taxes on employees’ wages net of transfers (income taxes plus employer and employee SSCs and payroll taxes minus cash benefits) as a proportion of the costs to employers of employing labour (gross wages plus employer SSCs). In short, it measures the burden of taxes on employees’ labour income relative to labour costs. In the OECD analysis, wage earners are assumed to have standard employment contracts, and as such this measure does not cover the tax treatment of the self- employed, who in some countries have a different tax treatment, or those who earn labour income through entities such as companies. 19 77. Figure 13 shows that New Zealand’s average labour tax wedge is relatively low compared to other OECD countries. In 2022, the labour tax wedge for a single person without children at average earnings was 20.1% (or 22.2 % if ACC levies are included) in New Zealand, compared to an OECD average of 34.6%. New Zealand’s labour tax wedge relative to the OECD average was in a similar position for a single person without children at 67% and 167% of average earnings. By comparing to figure 9, we see that the countries with the highest labour tax wedge also have a high tax-to-GDP ratio, 19 Taxing Wages 2020 notes that employer liability for social insurance does not tend to extend to self- employed workers in the countries the OECD investigated. Employee social contributions can also vary across employment forms. However, self-employed workers not covered by SSCs may need to self-insure (OECD, 2020). 20.2 21.4 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Colombia Chile Mexico Türkiye Ireland Costa Rica Latvia Hungary Israel Korea United States Australia Lithuania Portugal United Kingdom Estonia New Zealand (ad) Switzerland Iceland Greece OECD average Poland Canada Slovak Republic Czechia Japan Slovenia Spain Luxembourg Netherlands Italy Germany Finland Belgium France Sweden Norway Austria Denmark Revenue (% of GDP) Income taxes (individuals and corporates)SSCs and payroll taxes 24 suggesting that high tax-to-GDP ratios are sustained in part through high taxes on labour. Figure 13: Labour tax wedge as a percent of labour costs (single person without children at average earnings), 2022 Source: OECD, 2024 78. Similarly, if we just look at income taxes levied on individuals (that is, taxes on wages, self-employment income and capital income taxed in the hands of individuals), as well as employer and employee SSCs and payroll taxes, these taxes as a percent of GDP are relatively low in New Zealand (being 14.1 % of GDP versus 17.8% for the OECD average in 2021). 20 This is consistent with New Zealand having a low tax wedge on employee’s labour income compared to other OECD countries and suggests we might be capturing relatively less tax at the individual level rather than entity level, which we investigate below. 79. The OECD does not publish data enabling us to look in isolation at total taxes on capital income (that is, income earned on things people own). However, New Zealand raises more revenue from corporate income taxes as a proportion of GDP compared to the OECD average (the level of corporate tax to GDP will vary with the level of incorporation as well as the tax rate). In 2021, New Zealand raised 5.4% of tax revenue from corporate income taxes as a proportion of GDP compared to the OECD average of 3.3%. Corporate income tax revenue has been relatively volatile over the past 30 years, but New Zealand’s revenue from corporate tax, relative to GDP, always exceeded the OECD average over this period, as shown in figure 14. “New Zealand (ad)” here removes tax paid by the NZSF and Government Superannuation Fund. 80. Considering capital taxes at the individual level, New Zealand’s imputation system and lack of a general approach to taxing capital gains reduce the extent to which capital income is taxed at the individual level (see, for example, Hourani et al). The significance of corporate taxation in New Zealand, and entities such as PIEs, has implications for the extent to which domestic residents’ income, particularly capital 20 Figures on this page for individuals’ tax and company tax exclude the category in the OECD data that is unallocated income whereas figure 16 includes this amount allocated 50/50. 20.1 22.2 34.6 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Colombia Chile New Zealand Mexico New Zealand (inc.

Figure 14: Corporate income tax revenue as a percent of GDP, 1991–2021 Source: OECD, 2024 81. New Zealand is unusual among OECD countries in not having a general tax on income from capital gains. A general capital gains tax was introduced in Australia in 1985. It raised A$25 billion in 2021–22, or around 1% of GDP. 82. Turning to consumption taxes, VATs are a widely used tax, being applied in over 170 countries worldwide and collecting around a fifth of global tax revenues (De la Feria & Swistak, 2024). New Zealand raises 1. 7 percentage points of GDP more than the OECD average from general taxes on goods and services, after adjusting for GST on public services for comparability. In 2021, New Zealand raised 8. 9% of GDP from such taxes (on a comparable basis), compared to the OECD average of 7.2%. 83. In terms of smaller tax bases, figure 15 shows that New Zealand raises more revenue as a share of GDP from recurrent property taxes compared to the OECD average, and less revenue as a share of GDP from taxes on financial and capital transactions, taxes on estates, inheritances and gifts, taxes on individual net wealth and non-general taxes on goods and services (that is, taxes on the consumption of goods and services other than general taxes like GST). 84. Every OECD country levies some form of recurrent tax on immoveable property. New Zealand does so in the form of local government rates, which raised 1.9% of GDP in 2021. Across the OECD, revenue from these taxes ranged from 0.1% (in Luxembourg) to 3.0% (in Canada) of GDP in 2021, with an average of 1%. 85. Over half the OECD countries levy taxes on estates, inheritances and gifts, raising 0.1% of GDP on average across the OECD in every year since 2000, except for 2021 where they raised 0. 2% of GDP on average. As noted above, New Zealand abolished estate duty in the 1990s and gift duty in 2011. 3.3 5.4 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1991199219931994199519961997199819992000200120022003200420052006200720082009201020112012201320142015201620172018201920202021 Revenue (% of GDP) OECD averageNew ZealandNew Zealand (ad) 26 86. Recurrent taxes on net wealth have become less common across the OECD over time. An OECD study published in 2018 noted that the number of member countries levying individual net wealth taxes fell from 12 in 1990 to four in 2017 (OECD, 2018). Switzerland raises the highest revenue from individual net wealth taxes as a share of GDP in 2021, at 1.2%. The OECD average is 0.2%. New Zealand does not have net wealth taxes . 87. Every OECD country levies some form of non -general tax on goods and services. Revenue from these taxes was 3.6% of GDP on average across the OECD in 2021, versus 2.3% of GDP in New Zealand. These taxes include specific taxes on goods and services, such as excise taxes and import duties, and recurrent taxes on the use of goods such as motor vehicles. New Zealand does not impose the latter. Figure 15: Revenue from other tax bases as a percent of GDP, 2021 Source: OECD, 2024 88. As shown in figure 9, after adjusting for GST on public services, New Zealand’s tax-to- GDP ratio is 0.9 percentage points below the OECD average. Figure 16 decomposes the elements of the 0.9 percentage point difference (figures do not add to 0.9 due to rounding). A negative number indicates the OECD average tax-to-GDP ratio is higher than the corresponding New Zealand figure. In sum, compared to the OECD average: • New Zealand has significantly lower individual level taxes as a portion of GDP when SSCs and payroll taxes are included. • New Zealand has lower taxes on net wealth and wealth and capital transfers as a portion of GDP. • For all taxes on goods and services (on a comparable basis), New Zealand raises slightly above the OECD average from these taxes as a portion of GDP. • New Zealand’s level of recurrent property taxes (local government rates) is almost 1 percentage point of GDP higher than the OECD average. • New Zealand raises a significantly higher portion of GDP from corporate tax than the OECD average. 1.9 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.3 1.0 0.5 0.2 0.2 3.6 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0 Property taxes Financial and capital transaction taxes Estate, inheritance and gift taxes Individual net wealth taxes Non-general taxes on goods and services Revenue (% of GDP) New Zealand OECD average 27 Figure 16: Decomposition of difference in OECD average tax-to-GDP ratio and New Zealand tax-to-GDP ratio, 2021 Source: OECD, 2024 Tax regimes 89. In terms of personal taxation, according to the classifications in an OECD study, New Zealand is one of eight OECD countries that operates a broadly comprehensive personal income tax system, in which labour and capital income are taxed at the same rate (Hourani et al, 2023). 21 Many other OECD countries operate a schedular system, in which different types of income are taxed at different rates. Dual income tax systems are a type of schedular system under which labour income is usually taxed at progressive rates while capital income (that is, income earned on things people own) is typically taxed at lower, flatter rates. Semi-dual systems tax some types of capital income at the same progressive rates as labour income while taxing other types of capital income at flat rates. Dual income tax systems are the most common system among the OECD countries.

In terms of the integration of corporate and personal taxation, New Zealand is one of six OECD countries in the OECD’s classification that use a type of imputation system to adjust personal tax to account for corporate taxes on distributed profits. New Zealand’s imputation system is described in paragraph 51 . 91. The most common approach to taxing dividends in the OECD is the classical system, where no explicit adjustment is made to dividend taxation to account for corporate taxes. Instead, all distributed dividend income is taxable either at the personal income tax level (in some cases at a discounted rate) or through final withholding (tax is withheld by the distributing company and no further tax is payable at the shareholder level). Some countries operate a partial inclusion system, where a portion of distributed dividend income is tax exempt, and the remainder is taxed under personal income tax.

New Zealand’s company income tax rate is currently higher than the OECD average, as shown in figure 17. In the late 1980s and 1990s, New Zealand’s rate was lower than the average of those same countries, on both a weighted 22 and unweighted basis. S ince then, although New Zealand has reduced its rate, many other OECD countries have reduced their rates by more, and New Zealand’s rate is now higher than both the OECD weighted and unweighted averages ( by 2 and 4.4 percentage points respectively). 93. In 2023, New Zealand had the eighth highest company tax rate in the OECD, taking into account company taxes levied at different levels of government. As noted above, New Zealand raises a relatively high amount of revenue from company income tax as a proportion of GDP compared to other OECD countries (which may be partly attributable to the level of incorporation). 22 The weighted average is calculated by weighting rates by nominal GDP. 29 Figure 17: Statutory company tax rates, 1981–2023 23 Source: OECD, 2024 94. New Zealand also has relatively high effective marginal tax rates on investments compared to other OECD countries. The effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) is the proportion of the real pre-tax rate of return on a marginal investment (that is, the last investment that it is profitable to undertake) that is lost in tax. 95. Figure 18 shows OECD calculations for the unweighted average EMTR across four asset classes (buildings, inventories, tangible assets and acquired intangibles), assuming a real interest rate of 3% and an inflation rate of 1%. New Zealand’s rate was calculated for 2020 when depreciation deductions were available for non-residential buildings. Under this scenario, the OECD calculated that New Zealand’s EMTR was higher than all but three other countries. 23 Figure 17 shows average statutory combined central and sub-central government company tax rates for countries that were members of the OECD on 1 January 2024.

New Zealand has a relatively small gap between its company tax rate and its top personal income tax rate compared to other OECD countries. A wider gap can increase incentives for taxpayers to shelter income in companies. The gap in New Zealand is currently 11 percentage points. Many countries have a much wider gap and manage the risks of income sheltering through measures such as capital gains taxes, limits on taxpayer discretion over the allocation of labour and capital income, retained profits taxes and general anti-avoidance rules. 97. Figure 19 shows the gap in OECD countries between the top personal tax rate, for a single person without dependents, and the company tax rate. 25 The top personal tax rate is calculated as the additional personal income tax result ing from a unit increase in gross wage earnings at the earnings threshold where the top personal statutory tax rate first applies. It does not include SSCs, which if included would result in a larger gap for some countries. 24 See Hanappi (2018) for methodology. 25 The combined top personal tax rate takes account of central and sub-central government taxes and the effects of tax credits, the deductibility of sub-central taxes in central government taxes, etc. The company tax rate is the combined central and sub-central government rate.

New Zealand’s GST regime is the broadest value added tax (VAT) regime in the OECD. As noted above, New Zealand’s GST applies to almost all goods and services (including public services). Conversely, many other OECD countries’ regimes apply reduced rates and exemptions to a wide range of goods and services such as necessities. 99. The OECD measures the extent to which a country’s VAT regime applies VAT to all goods and services through a measure called the revenue ratio. 26 A higher ratio reflects a broad-based regime while a lower ratio reflects the presence of reduced rates and exemptions. Figure 20 shows that, in 2020, New Zealand’s ratio was the highest in the OECD and significantly higher than the second highest ratio. New Zealand’s high ratio is a consequence of our broad GST base, limited use of non-standard rates and the charging of GST on public services. 26 The VAT revenue ratio is a measure of the comprehensiveness of a VAT base. It measures the difference between actual revenue and the revenue that would be collected if VAT was applied at a country’s standard rate to all final consumption expenditure. It is calculated as: VAT Revenue / \[(Consumption - VAT revenue) x standard VAT rate\]. Consumption is Final Consumption Expenditure in national accounts.

Figure 21 shows that New Zealand’s standard GST rate is one of the lowest in the OECD. In 2020, standard rates of GST in OECD countries ranged from 5% in Canada 27 to 27% in Hungary. New Zealand’s rate of 15% was seventh lowest. Despite this low rate, New Zealand raises a higher level of revenue from GST, relative to GDP, than the OECD average due to the lack of exemptions and reduced rates, as discussed above.

New Zealand’s tax system collects around a third of our GDP in tax revenue. Over 90% of central government tax revenue, and 87% of general government tax revenue, is raised from two main bases: income tax and GST. Within these bases, New Zealand has for many years followed a broad-based low-rate approach, which helps minimise economic distortions and administration costs. Previous reviews have noted the benefits of this approach, but have also identified tensions in the system, including around the comprehensiveness of our income tax bases and the interface of personal and entity tax regimes. 102. New Zealand’s tax system raises a similar level of revenue, as a proportion of GDP, as the average of OECD countries. However, New Zealand’s system is unusual in the OECD in not having significant specific taxes on labour income, such as SSCs or payroll taxes. Further, New Zealand’s comprehensive income tax system generally taxes the labour and capital income of individuals at the same rate and utilises an imputation system to align taxation of dividends with personal tax rates. In contrast, many other countries operate schedular systems that tax capital income at a lower rate than labour income. Consequently, most OECD countries typically have a higher direct burden of tax on employee labour income than New Zealand. In particular, countries with high tax-to-GDP ratios tend to have a much higher tax burden on labour income from employment than New Zealand. In contrast, New Zealand’s system has a higher company tax rate than the OECD average and high effective marginal tax rates on inbound investments. Further, recurrent taxes on property (levied through local body rates) are relatively high in New Zealand. 103. New Zealand’s tax system relies on the taxation of both entities and individuals. The rates set at the entity level often reflect a trade-off between economic costs and the desire to align the taxation of domestic residents with the personal tax rates under our comprehensive income tax. The result is that not all capital income is ultimately taxed at personal tax rates. A question is – could other approaches better align these trade-offs? This is discussed further in chapter 3. 34 CHAPTER 2: CONSIDERATIONS FOR A FUTURE TAX SYSTEM Introduction 104. Chapter 1 described New Zealand’s tax system and compared it to tax systems in other OECD countries. This chapter discusses the major emerging trends that are likely to have implications for New Zealand’s tax system over the next 50 years and examines how other countries are dealing with similar challenges. Long-term trends – a global perspective 105. In its 2021 paper The Long Game: Fiscal outlooks to 2060 underline need for structural reform, the OECD considers future trends for OECD countries. Key trends identified in the report include slower real GDP growth for OECD economies, population ageing and higher relative prices for services (such as health care). These trends combine to produce an increase in fiscal pressures for OECD countries. These same drivers are also creating fiscal pressures in New Zealand. The OECD’s projections put New Zealand close to the median in terms of forecast fiscal pressures. Long-term trends in New Zealand New Zealand’s population is ageing 106. In Stats NZ’s median population projection (2022 base), New Zealand's population is anticipated to reach over 6.0 million by 2048, and over 6.6 million by 2073. There are three key factors impacting New Zealand’s future population: life expectancy, fertility and migration. Overall, these combine such that the future population will be larger and older. 107. Currently, the average (median) New Zealander is 38 years old, however by 2073 the average age is expected to be over 47 years old. An ageing population is largely due to two factors: lower death rates (that is, longer life expectancy – when combined with the “baby boomer 28 ” cohort) and lower birth rates. 108. Figure 22 shows that life expectancy at birth has been increasing for many decades and is projected to continue to increase. This is due to a wide range of social factors including access to health care, education, and healthier lifestyles. Better medical treatments, awareness of risk factors and lower child mortality have all played a part. Healthy life expectancy (which subtracts years spent in poor health) is also increasing in New Zealand, but not at the same rate. Between 1990 and 2017, the time that someone at birth could expect to spend in poor health increased by 1.7 years for females and by 2.2 years for males (Ministry of Health, 2020). 28 Defined as people born between 1946 and 1965. 35 Figure 22: Life expectancy at birth, 1951–2073 Note: the data is in 5-year increments except between 2005–2007 and 2012–2014. Source: Stats NZ, National and subnational period life tables, 2021 & National population projections, 2022 (June years). 109. New Zealand’s current fertility rate 29 of 1.56 live births per woman (December 2023) is below the natural replacement rate of 2.1 live births. Figure 23 shows that New Zealand’s fertility rate has been in decline for some time, first falling below 2.1 live births in 1978 (and since 2013). New Zealand is not alone in experiencing a sustained weakening of its fertility rate, with countries such as Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States, amongst others experiencing similar reductions in newborn children. Figure 23: Fertility rate, 1960–2023 Source: Stats NZ, Births and deaths, 2024 (December years) 29 In most countries, the replacement fertility level is roughly 2.1 live births per woman because not everyone reaches child-bearing age, but the exact number depends on gender ratios at birth and infant and child mortality rates. Migration trends are not taken into account. 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 1951196119711981199120012013202320332043205320632073 Age MaleFemale 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 1960196319661969197219751978198119841987199019931996199920022005200820112014201720202023 Births per woman 36 110. Migration can also impact on the population age structure. Historically, New Zealand has had relatively high rates of migration, which has supported population growth. The average migrant tends to be younger, which slows population ageing (Stillman & Maré, 2009). However, the Treasury notes t here is evidence to suggest that, over time, migrants are likely to shift towards having similar numbers of children as the population of the country they have moved to, mitigating this impact (The Treasury, 2021). 111. As a result of these trends, New Zealand’s age structure is changing. Figure 24 shows that the proportion of the population aged 65 and over, compared to the total population, has been steadily increasing over recent decades and is projected to continue increasing. Figure 24: Proportion of total population over 65, 1963–2073 Source: Stats NZ, National population projections, 2022 (June years) 112. The 65+ dependency ratio illustrates the changing age structure by relating the number of people over 65 to the working-age population (aged 15 to 64 years). The 65+ dependency ratio has increased over recent decades and is projected to continue to increase. In the mid-1960s, there were 14 people aged 65+ per 100 people aged 15 to 64. By 2022 it had increased to 25 per 100. By 2073, the ratio is projected to be 48 per 100 in the median projection (or 2.1 working aged people for every person aged 65 and over). Future labour force 113. Over recent decades, two key factors impacting on the labour force have been increasing labour force participation of over 65s and increasing labour force participation by women. The labour force measures thos e over 15 years old who are working or seeking work. 30 The labour force participation rate measures the proportion of people in the labour force relative to the population (for those over 15). 114. Figure 25 shows that since the late 1990s, the labour force participation rate of those aged over 65 has increased – that is more over 65s are now working, or seeking 30 The labour force includes people aged 15 years and over who regularly work for one or more hours per week for financial gain, people who work without pay in a family business, and unemployed people seeking work. Retired people are not in the labour force but over 65s who work, or are seeking work, are. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 19631968197319781983198819931998200320082013201820232028203320382043204820532058206320682073 Population (%) 37 work, than in the past. We have also seen higher labour force participation from women, especially women of child-bearing age. Female participation rose 12.5 percentage points from 55% in 1986 to 68% in 2023. Factors driving this increase include higher female employment in traditionally male-dominated jobs, greater childcare support, and rising household costs. Figure 25: Labour force participation rate of people aged 65+ and females of all ages, 1986–2023 Source: Stats NZ, Household labour force survey, 2024 (December years) 115. Over the next 50 years, New Zealand’s labour force is projected to grow, but the growth rate will slow in the long term. Under Stats NZ’s median labour force projection (2020 base), the labour force grows from 2.9 million people in 2020 to around 3.7 million in the early 2070s. The age structure of the labour force is, however, projected to change with the proportion of over 65s nearly doubling, from 6% to 11%, while the proportion of under 45s declines from 57% to 50% in the median scenario. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 19861987198819891990199119921993199419951996199719981999200020012002200320042005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017201820192020202120222023 Participation rate (%) Female65+ 38 Figure 26: Distribution of the labour force by age group, 2020–2073 Source: Stats NZ, National labour force projections, 2021 (June years) 116. Stats NZ’s labour force projections indicate that New Zealand is currently near peak labour force participation. Projections to 2073 (figure 27) show a declining overall labour force participation rate (LFPR) in the median scenario – that is, the number of people in the labour force relative to the adult population is likely to decline over the long term. Currently around 70% of adults are in the labour force whereas Stats NZ’s median projection sees this decline to around 63% in 2073. This drop is despite assumptions of static or increasing labour force participation rates at most ages and is due to a greater proportion of the population at older ages where LFPRs are lowest (Stats NZ, 2021). 117. The economic dependency ratio measures the number of non-workers (including children) in a country relative to thos e working (it is the number of people not in the labour force per 100 people in the labour force). It aims to assess the economic burden on the workforce. Figure 27 shows that as the population ages, the economic dependency ratio is projected to increase. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 202020232028203320382043204820532058206320682073 Labour force (%) 15-2425-4445-6465+ 39 Figure 27: Economic dependency ratio and labour force participation rate, 2020–2073 Source: Stats NZ, National labour force projections, 2021 (June years) Economic growth is slowing down 118. The OECD’s 2021 long-term economic projections project that real GDP growth rates will continue to decline across OECD and G20 countries. For the OECD, growth in real GDP is projected to decline from 1.75% per annum in 2019 to 1.25% per annum by 2045. On a per capita basis, which is a better measure of living standards, real GDP per capita growth is projected to remain stable at around 1% to 1.25% per annum. Weak growth is due mainly to lower population growth and a declining share of the population in work due to ageing (Guillemette & Turner, 2021). 119. A declining share of the population in work will reduce the contribution of labour input to economic growth compared to the past. Consequently, p roductivity growth will be an important source of economic growth as populations age. Labour productivity measures the amount of GDP produced per hour of work. 120. New Zealand has a low level of labour productivity compared to the average OECD country. Galt (2023) finds that, in 2019, New Zealand’s level of labour productivity was only 62% of the median of a group of 19 OECD countries. 31 Despite relatively low labour productivity, Galt found New Zealand’s income growth performed better than the median of that group from the late 1990s to 2019. Gross national income per capita 32 increased from 68% of the median of that group in the late 1990s to 81% of the median in 2019. Galt attributes New Zealand’s relatively good performance to the following factors: an increase in the share of the population in employment, an increase in New Zealand’s average export prices relative to import prices and a reduction in New Zealand’s net international income deficit (net income earned from abroad). 121. While some aspects of New Zealand’s improved income performance since the 1990s may be enduring, there may be natural limits to others. As noted above, Stats 31 Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. 32 In contrast to GDP, (real) Gross National Income (GNI) accounts for relative changes in the price of imports and exports and income derived by residents outside New Zealand. 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 202020232028203320382043204820532058206320682073 Dependancy ratio and participation rate (%) Economic dependency ratioLFPR 40 NZ projections see a declining share of the population in employment over the long term. This suggests productivity growth will be an important source of income growth for New Zealand going forward. Fiscal pressures in New Zealand 122. These, and other, long-term trends will create fiscal pressures in New Zealand. This includes pressures on government spending and potential revenue impacts. These fiscal impacts are reported on regularly in the Treasury’s statement on the long-term fiscal position and are summarised below. Expenditure pressures from pension and health care costs 123. As a higher proportion of New Zealanders become 65 years or older, the fiscal cost of New Zealand Superannuation (NZS), relative to GDP, will increase if current settings remain in place. The Treasury’s 2021 Long-Term Fiscal Statement projected the net cost of New Zealand Superannuation to grow from 4.1% of GDP in 2020, to 6.3% of GDP by 2060 and 7.5% of GDP in 2080 based on current settings. 124. The New Zealand Superannuation Fund (NZSF) smooths some of the cost of superannuation. Since 2003 taxpayers have been contributing to the NZSF to meet some of the future costs of superannuation. In figure 28, the solid line shows the total net (of tax) cost of NZS (as a % of GDP) increasing over time. The dotted line shows the impact of NZSF contributions and withdrawals, and therefore the cost to the taxpayer (as a % of GDP) in any given year. Based on modelling in 2021, until about 2035, taxpayers are meeting the immediate cost of NZS and making additional contributions to the NZSF. After this point, the government is drawing down from the NZSF, meaning future taxpayers will only have to pay up to the dotted line rather than the solid line. Even with the NZSF, the cost to the taxpayer of NZS expenditure, relative to GDP, will increase if current settings remain in place. Figure 28: Superannuation expenditure net of New Zealand Superannuation Fund Source: The Treasury, 2021 125. The 2021 Long-Term Fiscal Statement also considered pressure on health expenditure. It notes that health expenditure has been rising significantly and this is likely to continue in the future. If government spending on health were to grow in line 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 202020302040205020602070208020902100 Expenditure (% of GDP) Withdrawal from NZSF Contribution to NZSF Net NZS expense Net NZS expense after contribution to or withdrawal from the NZSF 41 with historical trends, health expenditure was projected to increase from 6.9% of GDP in 2020–21 to 10.6% of GDP by 2060–61. This increase reflects both demographic changes, as a growing and ageing population puts more pressure on the health system, and the fact that health expenditure tends to grow more quicky than income over time in most economies due to factors such as technology and wage pressure. This growth is consistent with international trends as modelled by the OECD. 126. According to a 2013 Treasury background paper on long-term care and fiscal sustainability, l ong-term care expenditure (which includes rest-home care, home- based services to support older people and disability support services) constitutes around a fifth of all public health expenditure in New Zealand and stoo d at approximately 1.5% of GDP in 2013 (The Treasury, 2013). The paper notes that the sector is expected to face significant spending pressures over coming decades as the population ages. Projections under the Treasury's long-term fiscal model and by the OECD suggest that expenditure on long-term care could more than double over the next 50 years. Revenue impacts Impacts on tax revenues from a changing age structure 127. The ageing of the population will have impacts on the size of the income and consumption tax bases. However, there are complex effects. Research in New Zealand has suggested that the downward pressure on income tax revenue as retirees move out of the workforce would be partly offset by a higher proportion of the population moving through their peak earning years (45 to 54 age group) as shown in figure 26 (Ball & Creedy, 2013). The expected decline in the total population LFPR due to a greater share of the population at older ages (figure 27), is moderated by increases in LFPRs for women and those over 60 (figure 29). While retirees typically have lower incomes than workers, any impact on consumption will be offset to some extent by the spending down of retirement savings. Overall, we consider that the current evidence suggests that income and consumption taxes will have the capacity to gather significant revenue into the future. However, the impact of an ageing population on the size and mix of tax revenues is an area that would benefit from more research.

New platforms and business models have created opportunities for taxable activities to be delivered remotely by multinational companies based in any tax jurisdiction. This has eroded the domestic tax base and increased global tax competition, putting downward pressure on company tax revenues in New Zealand. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting is a multilateral work programme aimed at reforming the international tax system to address these issues. While some progress has been made it is likely that the underlying trends will continue to pose a risk to New Zealand’s tax revenues. Fiscal impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss 129. In 2023 the Treasury and the Ministry for the Environment published Ngā Kōrero Āhuarangi Me Te Ōhanga, Climate Economic and Fiscal Assessment 2023. The report notes that there will be economic costs from the physical impacts of climate change, as well as from the disruption arising from the transition to a low-emissions economy. Treasury modelling from the 2021 Long-Term Fiscal Statement suggested that by 2061, a higher frequency of droughts could have reduced GDP by 0.5% compared to the counterfactual (in the average of modelled simulations). A scenario with a higher frequency of storms and floods could additionally reduce GDP by about 0.7% by 2061. In the Treasury’s median scenario, the impact of increased storms, floods and droughts, on both revenue and expenditure, was estimated to result in net core Crown debt being higher, than the counterfactual, by 3.77% of GDP in 2061, although there are large uncertainty bounds. Other fiscal pressures may include higher insurance costs, spending on improving the resilience of critical infrastructure, and costs associated with supporting managed retreat. 130. Action taken to achieve New Zealand’s emissions targets (whether via regulation or spending) is also likely to slow economic growth and thereby impact revenue. The Climate Change Commission estimates that if its recommended emission reductions are achieved, GDP in 2050 will be about 1.2% lower than in a scenario with slower action to reduce emissions (Climate Change Commission, 2023). 131. There could also be significant economic impacts from biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse. This is an area where New Zealand may be particularly exposed given the size of our food and fibre and tourism sectors and their dependence on nature and biodiversity. Researchers at the World Bank have concluded that an ecosystem collapse would cost about 2.3% of global GDP annually by 2030 (Johnson et al, 2021). Impacts on tax revenue from disruptive technology 132. The gig economy, increasing automation and digitalisation, artificial intelligence and other disruptive technology are likely to change the nature of work and have implications for our tax bases and how we collect taxes. 133. As one example, artificial intelligence has the potential to expand automation throughout the economy, potentially displacing jobs in multiple sectors. Impacts are highly uncertain however, some posit that one outcome could be a reduced labour share in national incomes and increased share for capital (Brollo et al, 2024). If this were to happen, our tax system may need to adjust by relying more heavily on taxes on capital. 134. As another example, a decrease in work organised through employment relationships and an increase in casual work, including in the use of independent workers for temporary contracts (the gig economy), could make it harder to collect income tax. However, as figure 30 shows, there does not appear to have been a significant structural change in the nature of employment relationships – with only 43 around a 3-percentage point variation in the share of self-employed over the last 25 years. 135. We consider issues arising from disruptive technology and the changing nature of work are either most relevant to tax administration (which we do not intend to focus on in the next LTIB) or have highly uncertain impacts. So, we propose not to consider the impact of these factors further in the LTIB. Figure 30: Proportions of employment type, 1987–2024 Source: Stats NZ, Household labour force survey, 2024 (March years) Policy options to address fiscal pressures 136. It is proposed that our 2025 LTIB is focused on what a suitable tax system for the future would be, given the trends discussed in this chapter and matters identified in chapter 1. One consequence of future fiscal pressures is that the tax system might be called upon to lift revenue raised as a percentage of GDP. But raising the tax-to-GDP ratio is only one possible response to fiscal pressures. Policy changes that reduce spending growth or increase GDP per capita are another possible response. Below we look at policy changes that could mitigate fiscal pressures from an ageing population that have been considered by other countries. Lifting employment 137. The OECD estimates that labour market reforms that lift employment in OECD countries could boost per capita GDP growth and thereby reduce fiscal pressures (Guillemette & Turner, 2021). Examples of policy measures that raise employment generally include active labour market policies, family benefits, maternity leave, subsidised childcare and lower tax rates on work. Removing higher tax rates for secondary earners also improves workforce participation. Measures specifically aimed at increasing employment by encouraging longer working lives, other than lifting the retirement age discussed below, include encouraging employers to retain or hire older workers, retraining programmes to help older workers acquire new skills, and programmes to improve health at older ages. 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 19871988198919901991199219931994199519961997199819992000200120022003200420052006200720082009201020112012201320142015201620172018201920202021202220232024 Share of total employment Paid employeeEmployerSelf-employedUnpaid family workerNot specified 44 138. New Zealand’s policy settings already incentivise the employment of older workers. Unlike many other countries, the universal nature of New Zealand Superannuation means older individuals need not retire at 65 years old to be entitled to New Zealand Superannuation (Hurnard, 2005). Figure 25 shows that New Zealand’s labour force participation rate amongst individuals aged over 65 has increased since the late 1990s. Extending working lives 139. Many OECD countries have taken decisions to gradually lift the age of retirement. This could reduce fiscal pressures by both reducing the cost of superannuation and improving labour force participation. The eight countries with the highest future retirement age have all linked retirement age to changes in life expectancy. Other trends include the gradual disappearance of gender differences in retirement age, and the restriction or elimination of early retirement options. Figure 31: Current and future retirement ages 33 Source: OECD, 2023 140. Considering changes to the age of eligibility for NZS is one option for New Zealand. Another option is to consider whether to shift the existing policy balance between universal and contributory retirement support. The OECD classifies country pension models into three tiers: publicly provided pension schemes (Tier 1); mandatory personal retirement savings schemes (Tier 2); and voluntary personal retirement savings schemes (Tier 3). New Zealand is an outlier among OECD countries in relying primarily on a Tier 1 scheme for retirement income support. New Zealand and Ireland are the only two OECD countries not to have a Tier 2 scheme, and New Zealand’s tax treatment of Tier 3 schemes is among the least generous in the OECD (Coleman, 2011). Tax and growth 141. One issue to consider in choosing how to address long-term fiscal pressures is whether the literature provides clear conclusions as to how higher levels of taxation 33 For a male with a full career from age 22. 50 55 60 65 70 75 Denmark Italy Estonia Netherlands Sweden Finland Slovak Republic Portugal Iceland Israel Norway Australia United Kingdom United States Germany Belgium OECD average Ireland Greece Austria Canada Chile Hungary Mexico New Zealand Poland Spain Switzerland France LatviaKorea Czechia Lithuania Japan Costa Rica Türkiye Luxembourg Colombia Slovenia Age FutureCurrent 45 and expenditure may impact on the level of income per capita in New Zealand. Macro- economic level studies have provided mixed results, for two main reasons. 142. First, it is difficult to quantify the impact the level of taxation has on GDP growth, because: • while higher levels of taxation are typically correlated with higher GDP, causality either way is difficult to determine • factors such as education and infrastructure development (which are funded by tax) may be more important in determining income levels than tax, and • other policies, such as regulations, may in some cases have similar impacts to taxes, making cross-country comparisons difficult. 143. Second, governments levy tax to fund welfare enhancing expenditure, and the negative impact of taxes may be offset by the growth enhancing effect of government expenditure (Barro, 1988). Some studies show that a minimum level of tax capacity is needed to support sustained GDP growth (Gaspar et al, 2016). Given this, recent literature has focussed on what types of tax mixes have the least cost, in terms of economic growth and efficiency, rather than on the overall level of taxes and expenditure. For example, work by the OECD suggests in OECD countries (over the period 1980 to 2014) that the tax mix can have significant impacts on a country’s long- run growth (Johansson et al, 2008). 144. Given these considerations, we propose that the LTIB focus on understanding the desirability of different tax mixes (that is, the sensible set of tax bases and their relative ec onomic cost), rather than the overall level of taxation. Conclusion 145. Demographic trends and other factors will create pressure for government spending to increase as a percentage of GDP over the coming decades. If spending were to lift as a percentage of GDP, the tax system would need to respond accordingly. While it is not a given that fiscal pressures will result in higher government spending as a percentage of GDP over time, these trends create uncertainty as to future revenue needs and mean that fiscal sustainability is an important issue for our tax system over the longer term. 46 CHAPTER 3: PROPOSED LONG-TERM INSIGHTS BRIEFING TOPIC A suitable tax system for the future 146. Given the matters raised in chapters 1 and 2, we propose that Inland Revenue’s next LTIB explores what broad structure of the tax system would be suitable for the future. 147. In our view, a suitable tax system for the future is one that can raise the amount of revenue required while keeping the costs of raising that revenue as low as possible (efficiency) and meeting the government of the day’s equity goals in terms of the distribution of the tax burden. It should also be a system that is fit for purpose for different cohorts in society, for example serving Māori communities well. 148. We propose that our focus in the next LTIB be on revenue raising taxes. We do not plan to look in depth at specific taxes that are primarily aimed at changing behaviour (corrective taxes), such as reducing environmental harms or at windfall taxes. While these taxes also raise revenue, they raise different policy issues from revenue taxes. Revenue raising taxes are a large topic in themselves. Further, environmental taxes were looked at in depth in the Tax Working Group’s 2019 report and since that time an inter-governmental environmental tax framework has been developed. 149. We consider the following are important in considering how to design the (revenue raising) tax system for the future: • fiscal sustainability over the long term • economic outcomes (efficiency and productivity), and • distributional outcomes (equity). 150. Given expenditure pressures from an ageing population, a key issue is how the tax system contributes to fiscal sustainability over the long term. F uture governments have the option to address long-term fiscal pressures through expenditure control, wider use of user-pays or private funding mechanisms or increases in the tax-to-GDP ratio. Because we do not know what choices will be made, we do not know for certain what future revenue needs will be and whether they will be higher than now or not. However, we will have a more resilient fiscal system if our tax system can easily adapt to meeting different revenue requirements over time – that is, if we have a flexible tax system. This would allow a gradual adjustment to long-term fiscal pressures if, and when, they emerge. 151. Flexibility could also be considered from a distributional point of view. Different governments are likely to take different views on how to distribute the tax burden over time, so the tax system needs to have a level of flexibility to meet different distributional goals over time. 152. However, it is also important to have stability in the core tax structure to provide certainty so individuals and businesses can make decisions. Frequent large-scale changes in the tax structure are likely to be costly to society. 153. We therefore consider that the tax system of the future needs to be one with a stable core structure of bases but with flexibility to adapt to changing revenue needs and distributional goals over time. Our tax system currently displays some flexibility to achieve different revenue levels and distributional goals. Figure 1 showed core Crown tax revenue as a proportion of GDP has varied around 7 percentage points over the last 30 years (due to both cyclical factors and policy changes). Further, changes in 47 the structure of the personal income tax system have been the main way governments have implemented different goals in terms of the distribution of the tax burden. 154. However, a key element of flexibility is the ability to adjust rates on the main tax bases to change the level of revenue generated by the tax system. While it might be thought that any tax system is inherently flexible due to the ability to adjust rates, there are significant constraints on doing this in New Zealand’s current tax system. 155. In particular, t here are some tensions in our current income tax system that may limit its flexibility to achieve different revenue levels through rate changes and may have implications for productivity and equity. These are: • Integration of the personal tax system and taxation of entities. There is a tension between the efficiency and productivity objectives of supporting investment, and distributional and revenue objectives in how the entity and personal tax regimes interact. For example, to attract foreign investment, which is important to support productivity outcomes, it is important that the company tax rate not be too high. However, to support distributional and revenue goals, the personal tax system has a progressive marginal rate structure, and the top personal rates currently exceed the company rate of 28% (see Table 1, chapter 1). While the rate differential recognises these competing objectives, it also allows for income to be sheltered in companies and other entities, restricting options to raise revenue. • Comprehensiveness of the income tax base. While New Zealand’s income tax base is broad, there are gaps in the base. Specifically, New Zealand does not have a general tax on some forms of income, for example capital gains. This may constrain the ability to adjust rates to meet differing revenue levels by, for example, providing ways to recharacterise higher taxed income into a different form. 156. These features of the tax system may restrict a future government’s ability to increase revenue through the income tax system while also achieving equity goals. Alternatively, it also restricts our ability to lower effective tax rates on foreign investment below rates on domestic residents to support productivity goals. Therefore, we consider that a key issue to consider is whether there are alternate income tax design features/regimes that may allow for a more flexible revenue system or better balance these trade-offs. Given these trade-offs and future revenue needs, we think that the tax system of the future needs to be able to manage a level of difference between top personal and entity rates. 157. Value added consumption taxes (VAT) 34 have become a more important part of the tax mix in New Zealand and other OECD countries over time. Reasons cited for their popularity include their capacity to raise revenue, along with their perceived efficiency and neutrality (De la Feria & Swistak, 2024). However, as a flat tax relative to expenditure, concerns are often raised about the impact of increases in VAT rates on low-income households. If these concerns are persuasive, they may reduce the flexibility of using GST as a way of responding to long-term fiscal pressures. Therefore, we propose to consider measures that might sit alongside a GST increase that could reduce the impact of rate increases on low-income households. This would include, for example, consideration of approaches to providing low-income offsets to compensate for GST rate increases. 158. Another key consideration for our future tax system is what might be the right mix of tax bases that form the core structure of the tax system. This question is relevant at current revenue levels, but a question to explore is whether different tax bases may have greater justification at higher revenue levels and, if so, the relative merits of raising rates on the main bases versus adding new bases if revenue needs substantially 34 GST in New Zealand. 48 increased. Further, if the flexibility of our current bases to changing revenue needs is not increased, new tax bases may be the preferred approach to increasing revenue if future revenue needs increased. 159. To understand this question, we propose to first consider areas of overlap and difference between our two main tax bases and the pros and cons of changes in the tax mix between these bases. We then propose to consider what bases, if any, it might make sense to add to New Zealand’s current tax mix. Different legal bases for taxation may, from an economic perspective, tax the same factor. Therefore, it is important to understand what the differences and overlaps are between various potential bases to understand what bases it might be sensible to add. Our approach to this topic 160. As discussed, Inland Revenue is proposing that the next LTIB focuses on considering what broad structure of the tax system would be most suitable for the future. We propose to look at the broad structure of the tax system by focusing on two elements: tax bases and income and consumption tax regimes. 161. Our aim is to enable open discussion on the challenges that our tax system faces and possible options to address these challenges. 162. We will approach this topic by undertaking four main pieces of work: • Developing an analytical framework, including an economic framework to understand the effects of taxes on income and expenditure. • Considering the pros and cons of alternative income tax regimes and enhancements to our current income tax regimes. • Considering the literature on the design of alternative consumption tax regimes and approaches to low-income offsets to consumption tax rate increases. • Considering the pros and cons of new tax bases. 163. These work areas will be used to assess options for New Zealand. Analytical framework and economic effects of taxes on income and expenditure 164. The analytical framework will consider what the objectives of a good tax system should be. We will be considering tax incidence (who bears the burden of a tax), the economic costs that taxes can impose and approaches to assessing equity. Our aim is to articulate the principles to guide the design of a good and enduring tax structure for the future which is flexible enough to be an attractive structure for successive governments who may have a range of different revenue and distributional objectives. 165. We will also examine economic effects of our two main tax bases on income and expenditure and compare them to taxes on labour income only. We will discuss areas of overlap and difference between these bases and consider the pros and cons of having two main bases rather than just one. We will also discuss the arguments for differential rates of taxation on labour versus capital income, and the pros and cons of changes in the tax mix between these bases. Income tax regimes 166. As noted above, there are trade-offs between revenue integrity, efficiency and equity in the design of the income tax regimes. Given potential future revenue needs, we should not assume that the tax system of the future will align entity and top personal rates. A key question is whether alternative design features in the income tax 49 system or alternative approaches to income taxation can better manage rate differentials between different forms of income. 167. On income tax regimes, we intend to understand: • The comprehensiveness of our income tax and trade-offs in its design (such as between impacts on productivity and revenue integrity). • Would changes to our current regimes better manage differentials in the tax rates applying to income earned in different ways and provide greater flexibility to meet changing revenue and distributional objectives if necessary? • The pros and cons of alternative income tax regimes used in other countries. For example, Nordic countries use a dual income tax regime that taxes labour and capital income separately at different rates. Consumption tax regimes 168. As noted, consumption taxes have become an important part of the tax mix globally, in part due to their ability to raise revenue. 169. However, VATs have less ability to meet progressivity goals than income taxes, which may limit their capacity to be used to address increased revenue needs. While many countries’ VATs provide exemptions for various goods and services, this approach provides limited progressivity at a high cost in terms of foregone revenue. There is a literature that investigates the design of progressive consumption taxes, including how to increase progressivity within existing VAT design (for example by providing offsets for tax increases on the expenditure side of the government balance sheet). We intend to investigate this literature as part of this LTIB. Additional tax bases 170. Future fiscal pressures mean that alternative tax bases are likely to be contemplated in the future. Further, there is a question as to what mix of tax bases should form the stable core structure of our tax system, which is relevant at current revenue levels. 171. Given this, we propose to focus a chapter of the LTIB on considering the pros and cons of adding new tax bases to our current mix. We will consider the pros and cons of taxes on payroll (including social security contributions), land, real property, wealth, inheritances or estates, turnover, and transactions, and what overlaps and differences there are in these bases versus our existing bases. 172. The focuses on tax bases and tax regimes are related. Fiscal pressures mean that it is desirable to create an opportunity for open discussion of the pros and cons of introducing additional tax bases versus raising rates on existing bases if future revenue needs substantially increase. However, to answer this question, we also need to understand if adjustments to the various regimes through which income and consumption is taxed would increase the flexibility of the system to raise more revenue through increasing rates on our existing bases. 50 REFERENCES Ball, C. & Creedy, J.

Ngā utunga tōpū Lump sum payments
=================================

Lump sum payments – also called extra pay – include:

*   annual or special bonuses
*   cashed in annual leave
*   retiring or redundancy payments
*   payments for accepting restrictive covenants
*   exit inducement payments
*   gratuities (tips)
*   back pay, including backpaid holiday pay
*   lump sum holiday pay
*   employee share scheme benefits – if you choose to deduct tax.

Overtime or regular payments are not lump sum payments.

Calculating PAYE
----------------

You must deduct PAYE on lump sum payments. How you calculate PAYE depends on your employee's tax code, including whether they have a student loan or are enrolled in KiwiSaver. 

### If your employee uses an M SL or ME SL tax code

You must deduct student loan repayments from the lump sum payment if your employee earns more than $464 a week.

Find out how much you need to deduct by calculating the following steps.

1.  Add up gross earnings for the pay period. This is regular pay plus any extra pay.
2.  Subtract the loan repayment threshold.
3.  Multiply the remaining amount by 12%. Employees may present you with a student loan special deduction rate certificate. In this case, use the rate specified. If not, the standard rate is 12%.

If you have already applied the threshold to regular wages and paid those separately, do not apply it to the lump sum. In this case, deduct 12% from the entire lump sum. The above calculation avoids this situation by combining regular pay and any extra pay.

### If your employee uses an SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL tax code

You’ll need to deduct 12% from the whole lump sum payment to cover their student loan repayment. The pay period threshold does not apply.

### If your employee is enrolled in KiwiSaver

You’ll need to deduct KiwiSaver contributions from all lump sum payments except:

*   redundancy payments
*   accommodation you provide
*   an accommodation allowance
*   free or discounted shares under an employee share scheme
*   payments under a voluntary bonding scheme funded by the Ministry for Primary Industries, Te Whatu Ora – Health New Zealand or the Ministry of Education.

Filing employment information
-----------------------------

You need to tell us about the lump sum payment in the same period you made the payment. There are 2 options.

### File separate employment information about the payment

This is outside your regular employment information filing schedule.

File the information about the payment within:

*   2 working days of the date of the payment, if you file electronically
*   10 working days of the date of the payment, if you file by paper.

### Include information about the payment in the next regular reporting schedule

In some circumstances you can include the payment when you file employment information about the employee's next regular payday.

You can only do this if you:

*   file electronically
*   tell us about the payment before your ‘end date’ for the payment of PAYE and other deductions to us.

Your end date is the:

*   last day of the month if you pay PAYE and other deductions to us monthly.
*   15th of the month and the last day of the month if you pay PAYE and other deductions to us twice a month.

Our people are the reason we can do our work and make our workplace a great place to be. Our work is driven by our aspiration – improving oranga for current and future generations. We recognise that we make our biggest contribution to oranga though the activities we support and deliver to our customers. This year, we have continued our strong focus and commitment to responding to the needs of our diverse workforce and building an inclusive workplace for everyone. We do this by providing a workplace where everyone can feel respected, valued, and supported to do their best work every day, regardless of background. Our behaviours of Whanaungatanga, Manaakitanga and Mahi tika which are encompassed in Te Pou o te Tangata, are also vital in creating an inclusive workplace, where diversity is valued, and we are open and accountable for what we do. Last year when we developed our Māori Representation Roadmap, we committed to understanding the experience of Māori at Inland Revenue in terms of career development and barriers they face. We worked in partnership with our people to establish the actions that will create a positive impact on Māori representation, reduce the pay gaps and support meaningful career outcomes. Our 2024-25 roadmap builds on the work already underway and highlights the progress we are making towards our three Māori representation goals. These are to increase Māori joining our organisation, increase Māori in leadership roles and increase Māori representation across higher level/higher paid technical roles. We will continue to focus on four key areas that will help us meet our Māori representation goals as follows: • attraction and recruitment • career and development • leadership and the role of people leaders • our wider working environment. The actions outlined in this roadmap continue to support the goals in Kia Toipoto – Public Service Pay Gaps Action Plan relating to Māori representation. While I recognise that many of the actions in this roadmap will take time, I am encouraged by the progress we are making in creating positive change and improving Māori representation across Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake. 4 Developing the Māori Representation Roadmap 5 Our Māori representation roadmap responds to the insights we have gathered from our people to identify tangible actions that can support meaningful career outcomes for Māori. This roadmap continues from the 2023 Māori Representation Roadmap, which was created with engagement and partnership with Māori from across Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake. Many of the actions on the journey to create positive change in Māori representation are longer term and systemic - therefore this roadmap provides an update on progress on the actions to date, and the impact of these. Specifically, this year we have: • Held an open hui with Whānau Māori, followed by opportunities to share thoughts and feedback • Updated our unions and invited specific feedback from PSA Rūnanga • Worked with Te Kāhui Tūhono (our Māori/Crown team) to ensure that their work programme is reflected accurately, and that we are considering a broad range of factors that contribute to Māori representation. Developing the Māori Representation Roadmap 6 Diversity, equity and inclusion has had a dedicated focus at Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake since 2017. When developing our 23/24 roadmap last year, we committed to understanding the experiences of Māori, in terms of career development and the barriers that have been faced. Through on-going kōrero, and kanohi-ki-te-kanohi (face-to-face) engagements, Māori have shared their experiences and insights. We have worked in partnership to establish the actions that will create a positive impact on Māori representation, and in turn reduce the pay gaps. This focus is supported and reinforced through Kia Toipoto – Public Service Pay Gaps Action Plan guidance, from Te Kawa Mataaho Public Service Commission. Over the last 2 years we have taken an active approach in working with Māori to understand lived experiences. This has been through wānanga, hui and leveraging existing insight and resources. Understanding our peoples’ experience This helped us to establish the high-level areas of focus of: • People leaders - leaders gaining a better understanding of the cultural needs, practices and value of Māori. • Recruitment practices – focused on Māori cultural practices and enabling Māori to be unapologetically themselves. • Individual skills and support – support and empower the individual to realise their potential. • Promotion and visibility of Whānau Māori networks – increase feelings of inclusion and provide opportunities for capability growth. • Māori career pathways – supporting the overall increase of Māori representation at senior level and in technical roles. Our engagement with Māori also helped us to shape up the approach to work on Māori representation in partnership with Māori, in parallel with work undertaken as part of the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Roadmap. 7 Our focus on Māori representation supports our public sector priorities, with Kia Toipoto reflecting specific outcomes relating to Māori. Our Diversity Equity and Inclusion roadmap reflects our other Kia Toipoto actions. Kia Toipoto comes from the saying: “Waiho i te toipoto, kaua i te toiroa Let us be united, not wide apart.” The name speaks to closing gaps and creating unity and fairness for all peoples. Launched in November 2021, Kia Toipoto - the Public Service Pay Gaps Action Plan 2021–2024, has 3 goals relative to Māori representation mahi: • make substantial progress towards closing Māori pay gaps • accelerate progress for wāhine Māori • create fairer workplaces for all, including disabled people and members of rainbow communities. Public sector priority 8 Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake collects data through our People Experience Pulse (PXP), and through our employee management system. This roadmap uses data and insights collected about gender, pay, representation of Māori across the organisation and within roles. We use this data to help shape our organisational work programmes and provide insights into our representation and pay gaps. We use longitudinal data to help understand the changes and incremental shifts, and to show our progress to date. When referring to gender pay, the measurements do not include employees that identify outside the gender binary, due to limited numbers and the risk associated with publishing figures that may cause individual employee data to be identified. Māori data sovereignty The data in this roadmap is collected from our internal communities in accordance with the Privacy Act 2020. Māori data is collected in partnership with our Māori communities, and is treated with the respect and care of other taonga. Data and insights 9 Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake has been working over several years to ensure gender and ethnicity are not a determining factor in what people get paid. Measuring progress and change 10 Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake has been working over several years to ensure gender and ethnicity are not a determining factor in what people get paid. The drivers of our gender and ethnic pay gaps relate to representation. This means that although we have diversity within our frontline roles and lower paid roles, the level of diversity reduces in higher paid, more senior or influential roles. As of 30 July 2024, Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake has a Māori pay gap of 8.06%. This pay gap is driven by representation, although we have high representation within our frontline and lower paid roles, the levels of Māori reduce in higher paid, more senior or influential roles. The average pay for tāne Māori is $103,171 and for wāhine Māori is $81,286. • Data collected over the last 3 years on pay and ethnic identity, indicate average Māori pay has increased for both wāhine and tāne Māori. • Considering Māori representation has remained relatively steady at around 12%, the increase in average pay (and decrease in pay gaps) indicate positive progress, therefore we want to maintain the momentum.

This dimension has continued to trend in a positive direction since the People Experience Pulse (PXP) survey was introduced in 2020 with 86% of employees (non-Māori included) who responded in 2023 indicating they felt ‘mostly included’ (4) or ‘really included’ (5) in their day-to-day experience at work. Since 2020, reported feelings of inclusion for Māori have trended positively, with a minor decrease in May 2023. Completion rates for Māori were very similar to other groups, with equal rates or less than 3% difference in completion.

Our three representation goals are to: • increase Māori joining our organisation. • increase Māori in leadership roles, focusing on Team Lead roles and senior leadership, with a particular focus on wāhine Māori. • increase Māori representation across higher level/higher paid technical roles, with a particular focus on wāhine Māori. Since 2020, Māori representation has increased from 12.3% to 12.47%. Aotearoa New Zealand working Māori population is 15% (Statistics New Zealand Household Labour Force Survey March 2024).

In the past year we saw a minor drop in tāne Māori representation, counteracted by a slight increase in wāhine Māori representation. Exploration of attraction campaigns intentionally designed to attract Māori may help to further increase Māori representation, however we understand bringing more Māori into our entry roles is likely to negatively impact the pay gap data until we increase representation in senior leadership and technical roles.

Major improvements to GST to be introduced next week
====================================================

**01 February 2017**

Improvements to how New Zealanders file and manage their GST will be introduced next week as part of Inland Revenue’s multi-year programme to transform the tax system.

Deputy Commissioner Transformation Greg James says one of the most significant benefits for customers will be the ability to file and pay their GST at the same time, as opposed to the current system of having to pay via internet banking after filing a GST return.

“The new capabilities will enable customers to register for GST, register as a preparer of tax returns, amend GST returns and accounts, file and pay GST at the same time, set up payment plans, and track their GST payments and refunds – all online,” Mr James says.

“Other benefits will include the ability for new migrants and organisations to be able to apply online for an IRD number, and businesses will be able to use their New Zealand Business Number when they or their advisors contact us.”

The improved GST services are designed to make it easier for customers to get their tax right from the start, and will further reduce the time spent on tax compliance.

Mr James says the changes are the first tangible benefits for customers of Inland Revenue’s transformation programme, and are being delivered ahead of schedule and within budget.

More than half of New Zealand businesses file their GST through Inland Revenue’s secure online service myIR, or direct from their accounting software. From February 7, a new myGST tab on their myIR account will provide access to all their GST information.

As a consequence of the switch to the new GST improvements, Inland Revenue customer services will be unavailable from 3pm on Thursday February 2 until 8am on Tuesday February 7. This will include access to myIR, contact centres, and front of house services.

Mr James says the new technology will allow taxes and entitlements to be processed faster and more efficiently.

More information about the improved GST services is available at [www.ird.govt.nz/mygst](campaigns/2016/bt-new-gst-services-update.html)

Major overhaul for IRD social policy payments
=============================================

**17 July 2017**

The Government is planning major changes to how IRD pays social support so that people can know better what their entitlements are and be sure of receiving the right amount, Finance Minister Steven Joyce and Revenue Minister Judith Collins say.

“The Working for Families system is very complex and has been since it was introduced,” Mr Joyce says. “More than 40 per cent of people receiving Working for Families are underpaid, while a quarter of all people get paid too much and end up owing money to Inland Revenue.”

“The old IRD system wasn’t designed to handle income support payments like Working for Families,” Ms Collins says. “Our new system will allow us to base payments on better information and allow IRD to be much more accurate and adaptable to families’ changing circumstances and incomes.”

The Government has released a new consultation document, _Better administration of social policy_, which goes through the proposed changes and how they will affect families.

“As well as lifting family incomes, this year’s Budget began the process of simplifying people’s taxes and entitlements so they can easily see what they should be receiving. These proposals are the next step in creating a more straightforward tax and transfer system which responds quickly and simply as people’s circumstances change,” Mr Joyce says. “It will provide a better system for hundreds of thousands of New Zealand families.”

Along with Working for Families changes, the _Better administration of social policy_ consultation document also contains proposals for improving processes for child support and student loans.

“Child support payments will be automatically deducted from the wages or salary of all liable parents, and more comprehensive information about both parents’ incomes taken into account, including income from trusts. And if the receiving parent wishes, Child support payments could be passed on to them as soon as Inland Revenue had processed the payment,” Ms Collins says.

“We’re also proposing that a wider range of employment income would have student loan repayments deducted from New Zealand-based borrowers, reducing the chance of large end-of-year bills.”

Full details of the proposals are in the discussion document Better administration of social policy available at [www.makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz](http://www.makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz "www.makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz")

cutover of the BT Release 4 solution into the IR production environment, scheduled from Thursday 9 th to Thursday 16 th April 2020. This document describes the scope, approach, and planned execution timeline for all the technical cutover activities. This document also describes key information about entry and exit criteria, escalation processes, communications, roles and responsibilities, stakeholders, rollback/contingency plans, and the support/handover plan during the pre- and post-deployment process. The activities associated with the stopping/starting/ramping down of business activities to support the cutover will be covered in the Business Deployment Plan. The details around the internal and external communication will be covered in the Release 4 Comms Plan. Overview Business Transformation (BT) is a multi-year / multi-release transformation of IR’s core operating model and involves significant changes to its people, processes and technology. Stage 1 was successfully deployed in February 2017, focussing on improving the GST product and service for taxpayers and included the first use of the START core tax system, enabling new secure digital services to IR’s customers, New Zealand Business Number digital registration, and digital registration for migrants. Release 2 further extended the number of the tax products managed in START and introduced key legislative changes. R2 included: • Moving Withholding Tax, Gaming Machine Duty and Fringe Benefits Tax core tax services from FIRST to START (17 tax types were migrated to START, compared to only one tax type during Stage 1). • The collection of provisional tax information and payroll data in START, while the processing remains in FIRST. • Introduction of the new Accounting Information Method (AIM) and PAYE Pay-Period Reporting services for software vendors to provide to customers. • Delivery of New Zealand’s contribution to the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) to reduce offshore tax evasion. Release 3 further extended the number of tax products managed in START and supported more key legislative changes introduced by the ARMTARM Bill - Taxation (Annual Rates, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) and includes: • Moving income tax services from FIRST to START, including the introduction of new approaches to meeting tax obligations and paying tax. • Working for Families products will be administered from START. • Moving the Customer master from FIRST to START. • Improvements to the collection and use of Investment Income information. • Enabling auto-refunds and electronic submission of Tax Donation Credits. • Several digital changes including a revamped IRD.govt.nz as well as gateway services including customer onboarding capability and a new MyIR landing page (eServices). Release 4 is focused on extending the START capabilities further to continue making tax simpler for New Zealanders including: BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 6 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Moving KiwiSaver from FIRST and CAS into START. • Moving Student Loans from FIRST into START. • Moving Reserve Scheme processing from IERS into START. • Moving the Heritage Customs and StudyLink interfaces to START. • Implementing several changes to Tax at Source including moving end-to-end processing of employer obligations from FIRST to START. • Several digital changes including fully transitioning IRD.govt.nz to the new revamped website and making additional improvements to gateway services. Document Audience This document is intended for use by the following: • BT Programme Leadership team • BT Programme Deployment team • BT Business Deployment team • BT Deployment leads • BT PMO • BT Early Life Support team • BT Change and Comms team • Impacted IR Technical and business teams • Vendors • Enterprise Change Authority • IT&C • IR Incident Management team Deployment Overview Deployment within the IR BT programme comprises all activities required to implement the new solution in the Production environment and to ensure that the business is ready for the change. Deployment Readiness includes training, communication, Change Management, technical, environmental preparation, etc. The relationship between the Cutover and how it fits into the overall BT Deployment Plan is described in the following diagram: BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 7 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] All the BT Release 4 deployment activities are covered in the overall BT Release 4 Deployment Plan, which describes the different components that make up Release 4.0, and the different deployment phases. The Release 4 Deployment Plan is supported by the various Workstream Deployment plans (e.g. Business Deployment, Heritage, FAST etc.), as well as this document (BT R4 Deployment Approach). The Deployment Approach and Master Cutover Schedule are also supported by the different work stream cutover plans and describe the activities required to move the new Release 4 solution to the IR Production environment. The Deployment Approach does not contain the specific technical details of different cutover tasks, it manages the interactions between Workstreams and describes the complex, high risks tasks required to move from BT Release 3 to BT Release 4. Details of particular technical tasks are covered in the Workstream specific cutover plans.

Out of Scope: The following items are out of scope for the BT Release 4 Cutover: • Any activities outside the main cutover window (before Friday 3 and after Friday 17 April 2020), including but not limited to: o Business Deployment activities o Pre-deployments o Data cleansing o Post go-live production quality assurance (‘prod QA’) checks o Communications to External Stakeholders (will be done through the Marketing team or IR Relationship Managers). o Training and Change Management activities as per Organisation Change Management team’s scope. o Business Readiness Checkpoints. o Early Life Support. BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 9 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Assumptions The following assumptions have been made for the BT Release 4 Cutover: • All environmental / infrastructure changes to support BT Release 4 will be made as part of the preparation for the cutover. • Where possible, sub-systems and components will be deployed early to reduce the impact on the overall cutover. • Run sheets containing detailed implementation steps are managed by the Workstream Deployment Leads, while only high-level tasks will be tracked in the Master (Integrated) Cutover Schedule. • Any cutover activities performed by the Integration partners (Westpac, Charities, Companies Office, Customs and StudyLink) will have oversight by the IR Digital Ecosystem (DES) team. K ey milestones from these deployment events will feed into the Master Cutover Schedule. • Any cutover activities performed by external vendors (e.g. Exigen, SPK2IR, FIRST mainframe all require vendor support) will have oversight by the Heritage Deployment team. The exception to this are Spark changes, these will require oversight by the START deployment team and START Technical Team. • The Cutover Control Centre will be the source of authority for the duration of the cutover and will control all cutover activities. Decisions around escalations and rollback sit with the BT Deployment Manager in consultation with the BT Release 4 Programme Manager and the BT Programme Director. • The Cutover Control Centre will be fully engaged to gather timings and dependencies (twice daily reporting will be sent to project and Workstream leads and key IR business stakeholders). • Business verification testing (BPIV) will not test the full functionality of the solution but will be a validation of a subset of the high risk, critical business scenarios, to prove the cutover process (that the solution is working end-to-end as expected). BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 10 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3 BT Release 4.0 Cutover Proving the Cutover Schedule via Mock Go Lives The implementation of the BT R4 cutover plan will be rehearsed via a series of Mock Go Lives (MGL). MGLs allow the BT R4 deployment team to realistically simulate the implementation of the R4 cutover plan in IR’s qual environments. Given the complexity and duration of the R4 cutover plan, the MGLs are viewed as a series of necessary intermediate steps to prove the entirety of the R4 cutover schedule prior to implementation within IR’s production environment. In total, three MGLs will be performed. The lessons learned from one MGL will be incorporated into the cutover schedule for the subsequent MGL. Over the course of the three rehearsals the master cutover schedule will be refined with the intention that a full and complete cutover schedule is ready by the third MGL – such that this rehearsal can simulate the production cutover as closely as possible. Given that MGLs involve rehearsing the end-to-end cutover schedule, they are a lengthy and resource intensive exercise. While many elements of the R4 cutover schedule will not benefit from more than three cutover rehearsals, some cutover tasks are more complex and would benefit from further rehearsals to prove they can be completed to expected levels of quality and timing that will be expected during the production cutover window. In addition to MGLs, a series of smaller Supplementary Mock Conversions (SMCs) will also be run. The purpose of the SMCs is to specifically rehearse the end-to-end START data migration process. The data migration process is a higher complexity and higher risk component of the end-to-end cutover schedule – additional rehearsals of this process is beneficial identifying and resolving data issues ahead of the production cutover. The MGL and SMC approach will result in the integrated cutover processes being refined and success criteria being identified to achieve the most suitable outcome for the eventual go-live cutover. The purpose of MGLs is to rehearse the: • implementation of the end-to-end cutover schedule: completing technical and business cutover tasks in accordance with runtimes and dependencies within the cutover schedule. This extends to also confirm that all required tasks have been identified and sequenced correctly in the master cutover schedule. • running of cutover rituals: notably the status updates that are issued at regular intervals and via multiple channels during cutover. • running of cutover processes: such as issue management and escalation for complex issue triage and decision making, task initiation, and monitoring of task progress. The main lessons learned from the MGL during the previous BT Releases are: • To successfully manage an issue requires a dedicated resource and good communication. The process should include email comms to all parties working on the resolution for updates and letting them know when the issue is resolved, and they can stand down. • The interaction between the different teams around file management requires more handholding to ensure the correct files are picked up, moved and processed. • Spending a few minutes up front to clear old test files will save a lot of time later. • Having dedicated (named) resources from the IR vendors makes it easier to get tasks done and work through issue resolution. • The Cutover Control Centre must manage the coordination of issues to ensure all teams are working together and know what the other ones are/are not doing. BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 11 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Cutover Overview The BT Release 4 cutover window runs from 8am Thursday April 9 to 6pm Thursday April 16. The outage to core systems and channels (i.e. FIRST, START, myIR, contact centre) is planned from 4pm through to 8am on the respective shutdown and start-up days. The high-level sequence of cutover tasks during this window is illustrated in the high level cutover block diagram below. Refer to Appendix A: BT Release 4.0 – High Level Cutover diagram for the detailed block plan of the BT R4 cutover window. BT Release 4 Cutover Sequence The approach for the BT Release 4 Production Cutover is to execute all tasks in the Master Cutover schedule within the allocated cutover window. The Production cutover formally commences on Friday 3 rd April at the Checkpoint 4a meeting where the formal approval to commence the cutover will be sought from the BT Go Live Committee. Once the approval has been received, some of the early/pre-deployment activities will commence. The business ramp-down (which consist of finalising and stopping work) and system shutdown (the actual shutting down of systems and channels, like myIR, CAS, eServices, B2B’s with other agencies, etc.) activities will commence progressively from 5pm on Wednesday 8 April, with the full shutdown completed by 4pm on Thursday 9 April. Any users still working in any of the operational systems by 4pm will be kicked out of the system(s) and lose any work they are in the middle of. At 4pm, a subset of the daily FIRST and START batches will be performed to process the daily transactions and ensure all in-flight transactions and payments are processed prior to any technical changes occurring. Once the START end-of -day production jobs have been completed a backup will be taken, the START system will be upgraded by deploying the latest Release 4.0 code. System changes will then be made to prepare for the Data migration from FIRST. A number of other deployments will also be completed on Thursday. Once the FIRST end-of-day batch run has completed, the changes will be passed through to DPS/START. Once the FIRST changes have been passed through the DataBridge and the two systems are in sync, the FIRST to START Data Conversion can begin. This is expected to be at 12pm on Friday BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 12 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 10 th A pril and continue until 5am on Monday 13 th April. The Data Conversion consists of transforming the FIRST data into a different format, for it to be loaded into START, followed by a reconciliation to ensure both systems are in sync. The successful completion of Data Reconciliation is one of the four main items required for go live. The reconciliation will be followed by the Heritage and START Post Conversion and Co-existence activities. This is where the Release 4 tax products are “zero’ed” out from FIRST as they will now be mastered in START. At the same time the START system will be prepared for the BPIV activities by processing any financial transactions from the Westpac bank files. START will also be updated to be ready for go-live. The Crown reconciliation will be performed in parallel at this time, to verify that the financials between\[Information redacted\] reconcile. Any discrepancies will be investigated, and no unexplained differences are allowed. A successful Crown reconciliation is the second criteria required for go live. The Heritage portal deployments will be performed on Tuesday afternoon; this includes myIR, xPression and LOLA. The Business Verification testing (BPIV) is scheduled for s even hours on Wednesday 15 April, starting from 8am. The BPIV scope not only covers the new Release 4.0 functionality in START and FIRST, but also the transferring of transactions between the two systems as required to support the ongoing co-existence solution. The successful completion of BPIV is the third criteria required for go live. The output of Data Reconciliation, the Crown Reconciliation and BPIV will then be presented to the BT Go Live committee to get their approval to go live. This is the Checkpoint 4b meeting scheduled for 5pm on Wednesday evening. The purpose of this meeting is to give the BT Go live Committee an update on the outcome of the cutover and seek their formal approval to ‘go live’. This go-live decision is the point of no return, as it is thereafter that the backlog will be processed, resulting in large customer data changes. Rolling back past this point will require substantial unpicking of customer transactions across multiple systems. The CP4b review is a formal assessment, based on the below criteria: # Requirement Description Accepted Quality Criteria Accepted By 1 Cutover Data migration / conversion Data Conversion - all data successfully processed into START and the conversion reconciliation approved Has the R4 converted data reconciled against the source/Heritage data within acceptable limitations set by the business (i.e. no P1/P2 discrepancies identified)? 2 Crown Reconciliation Reconciliation of financials between FIRST / START and SAP Have Crown financials, pre- data-conversion, reconciled between FIRST, CAS and FMIS? Have Crown financials, post-data-conversion, reconciled between FIRST, CAS, IERS, FMIS, and START? 3 Business Verification (BPIV) completed successfully Success of the cutover confirmed through series of end-to end verification tests Has BPIV successfully completed with no open Sev 1 or 2 defects and any open Sev 3 defects have acceptable work-around in place? Go Live Committee BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 13 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] # Requirement Description Accepted Quality Criteria Accepted By 4 Go Live completed successfully Cutover completed, all tasks completed and solution ready to use (refer to section 4.2 for further details of these tasks.) Have all cutover tasks been executed? Are there any open Sev 1 or Sev 2 cutover incidents? Go Live Committee Once the Go decision has been received at Checkpoint 4b, the team will commence catch up processing of the backlog work that has been held leading up to and during the Cutover window. The start-up activities will commence on Thursday morning from 6am where, external channels and interfaces will be brought back up progressively throughout the day and access to all systems restored. The support of the new solution will be handed over to the BT ELS team on Thursday 16 th April at the 12pm ELS handover meeting. Product Specific Deployment Approaches In addition to this over-arching deployment approach, detailed deployment approaches are also developed for those products that: • are in scope for migration to START during the R4 window, and a detailed plan is required in order to ramp down BAU activity associated with this product in the Heritage environment prior to cutover, or • require detailed work-around plan to ensure continuity of key business events prior to and/or following the outage associated with the BT R4 cutover window. Each of these product specific deployment approaches have been developed separately from this document, and include: • KiwiSaver • Student Loans • Child Support and Working for Families • Payment Processing • EMP Processing • Income Tax • Disbursements Refer to Appendix E: Product Specific Deployment Approaches for further details on these. Key Cutover Milestones In addition to the detailed cutover sequencing outlined in section 3.3, a series of R4 cutover milestones will also be scheduled. The purpose of these milestones is to track critical path progress and/or status of critical cutover tasks that are require a successful result in order to satisfy the R4 cutover exit criteria. These milestones are as follows: Description Start Date and Time Finish Date and Time Checkpoint 4a Friday 3 rd April at 2pm Friday 3 rd April at 3pm Outage Commence Thursday 9 th April at 4pm Data Reconciliation Checkpoint Monday 13 th April at 10am Monday 13 th April at 11am Extended Outage Checkpoint Monday 13 th April at 4pm Monday 13 th April at 5pm Crown Reconciliation Checkpoint Tuesday 14 th April at midday Tuesday 14 th April at 5pm Checkpoint 4b Wednesday 15 th April at 5pm Wednesday 15 th April at 6pm Outage Over Thursday 16 th April at 8am BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 14 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Description Start Date and Time Finish Date and Time Handover to ELS Thursday 16 th April at 12pm Thursday 16 th April at 1:00pm Cutover Response to COVID-19 Due to the global pandemic and movement being severely restricted with New Zealand under lockdown for all but essential workers, the Release 4 cutover will mostly be performed remotely from the homes of the team members, with some high touch type activities being completed from one of the IRD offices (e.g. Asteron or Te Rapa). This is being done to ensure the wellbeing and safety of all staff involved in the Cutover process. The decision on which activities should be performed remotely was based on: • If system was available to perform tasks remotely • Complexity of the task • Number of people involved • Ease to manage/troubleshoot Based on the above, it was identified we needed to run a remote trial of the following activities prior to the Cutover to prove they could successfully be completed remotely. Task Remote Trial BPIV 1pm on Wednesday 1 st April Data Verification 9am on Thursday 2 nd April START Manual Tasks 11am Thursday 2 nd April Although there were some challenges identified during the remote trials, they were ultimately a success. It was therefore agreed that these activities could be completed with the majority of the resources based remotely. The lessons learned from the trials were applied to improve our remote working approach and ensure everyone is aware of what will be required of them during these three key cutover activities. (Refer to Appendix C: Remote BPIV Approach for further details) BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 15 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4 Success and Exit Criteria Cutover Success Criteria Going live will constitute a successful cutover but the criteria below will be used by the programme to measure the overall success of the cutover. The general success criteria for the BT Release 4 Production Cutover are defined as: • Successfully completing all planned cutover tasks within the agreed outage window (Thursday 9 th April at 4pm until Thursday 16 th April at 6pm). Refer to section 4.2 for a detailed breakdown of these tasks. • Successful migration and reconciliation of data and financials that is extracted from FIRST & CAS and loaded to START – no unexplained discrepancies. • Crown Reconciliation between FIRST, START and \[Information redacted\] reconcile with no unexplained variances – or with no unaccepted variances specific to KiwiSaver product. • BT Release 4 solution verified to be working as expected through the BPIV activity. • No open severity 1 or 2 defects at the end of the cutover, any open severity 3 defects with a business impact will have a business acceptable work-around in place. Core Cutover Deployment Tasks to Meet Exit Criteria To deem the cutover a success, the following cutover tasks must be completed within the defined R4 cutover window: Deployment Activity Description Successfully Achieved Partially Achieved Not Achieved Checkpoint 4a approval Formal approval in place to commence with the cutover.    Shutdown Successfully completed Business Ramp-down, shutting systems and channels in preparation of the cutover.    FIRST Batch (part A) Overnight batch runs completed to finalise all R4 tax information in FIRST and prepare FIRST for data migration.    START production job stream Overnight START batch runs completed to prepare START to be upgraded.    START Code deploy and Upgrade stream START code and config successfully deployed, while START upgraded in preparation for the Conversion.    DMSII to DPS reconciliation Reconciliation successfully completed between DMSII and DPS.    Data Conversion Complete FIRST 7 CAS data extracts, transform and load into START as well as the Data Reconciliation, with no unexplained discrepancies.    BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 16 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Deployment Activity Description Successfully Achieved Partially Achieved Not Achieved FIRST Application Data Batch Change jobs Complete FIRST Data changes to remove credit/debit balances and close periods/accounts for the migrated tax accounts.    FIRST Code deploy (part 2) Complete the FIRST Code Deploy (part 2).    START manual post conversion tasks and B- PIV prep Complete START post conversion tasks and BPIV prep stream in preparation for B-PIV.    Deploy Heritage Third Party Application changes Complete Code Deploy and System changes for Third Party Applications    Deploy Heritage Satellite changes Upgrade OFM to cater for the R4 interfaces.    Crown Reconciliation Crown Reconciliation completed approved, with no unexplained discrepancies.    START Go-Live stream Complete all activities to “ready” START for go-live.    FIRST Co-existence Complete FIRST co-existence jobs in preparation for B-PIV.    Business PIV Production verification tests must all PASS (no Sev 1 or 2 defects) to prove the solution works end-to- end and in scheduled sequence.    Checkpoint 4b approval Formal approval in place to “go” live.    Backlog processing All backlogged transactions processed into START and FIRST, ready for actions by the different IR business teams.    Start-up Successfully completed start-up activities to allow business operations to resume.    These criteria should be checked as part of a cutover close-out session where the Cutover Lessons Learned will be discussed in preparation for future cutovers. Consideration should be given to: • Were tasks well planned? • Were they completed in the correct time and was duration correctly estimated? • Were dependencies correctly identified? • Were any issues experienced with the group of tasks? • What could have been done better? BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 17 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5 Cutover Control Centre (CC) During the cutover window, all cutover tasks will be under the control of a Cutover Control Centre Manager. As this cutover spans over several days, the Cutover team will be rostered to ensure the entire cutover period is covered and that there will always be someone present in the (virtual) Control Centre. Additional support people will be on call to attend if required (this includes the IR Major Incident team as well as technical support teams). A formal escalation process will be in place. All tasks that deviate from planned process or duration will be formally escalated so appropriate mitigation can be put in place. The CC Manager is responsible for ensuring the escalation process is activated. Typically, the Cutover Control Centre would be primarily based from meeting room 7.1.01 of IR Headquarters within the Asteron Centre. Given the New Zealand Government’s response to COVID- 19 and enforcing of level 4 lockdown rules during R4 cutover, the Cutover Control Centre will be primarily based online via Microsoft Teams. The CC will perform the following tasks: • Manage and co-ordinate all cutover activities; • Act as the first point of contact for any escalations; • Escalate issues to the BT Deployment Manager (as necessary); • Log any issues arising from the cutover in the Cutover Issues Register; • Assign a Control Centre Issue Owner, and manage the issue to resolution; • Advise the BT Release 4 Programme Manager of any technical issues arising from deployment; • Schedule and run-status update meetings during the cutover period; and • Distribute status/progress updates at key points during the cutover (see section 7.1.1 for schedule of key Progress Checkpoints) The following contact details have been set up for decision points and discussions required during the management of all technical and business-related issues or escalations during the deployment. Contact Name Contact details Teams Meeting As per invite Control Centre email address BTCutoverControlTeam@ird.govt.nz Cutover team email addresses BT R4.0 Deployment Lead BT R4.0 Cutover Manager Control Centre Responsibilities The BT R4 Deployment Lead is responsible for the Cutover Control centre. Key responsibilities include: • Executing the Cutover Plan task by task to completion. • Directing cutover task owners to initiate and execute tasks on the Cutover P lan. • Issuing regular cutover status updates to project stakeholders. • Managing a register of issues/defects encountered during cutover. • Escalating technical issues arising from cutover to the BT R4 Release Manager and others as required. • Escalating business issues arising from the cutover to the IR Lead Business Transformation Manager and the Business Deployment Lead. BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 18 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Revising the Cutover Plan as a result of adding new tasks, deleting obsolete tasks, or changes to the scheduling, duration or dependencies of tasks, and executing the updated plan. • Conducting a Lessons Learned sessions post cutover to capture any lessons learned for future cutovers. 5.1.1 Agreeing and Executing the Cutover Plan Prior to cutover commencing, a Cutover Plan must be agreed with both the Technical Cutover teams and Business stakeholders. During the cutover the CC will: • Execute the cutover according to the Cutover Plan. • Update the plan as tasks are initiated and completed. The BT R4 Cutover Manager is responsible for the Cutover Plan. 5.1.2 Cutover Task Initiation Cutover task initiation will be managed by the Cutover Control Centre, this involves: • Sending a task initiation email to advise when the task owner needs to start their task (or a series of consecutive tasks performed by the same task owner). • Follow up with a phone call to the task owner to start a task, if no response has been received within 5 minutes of sending the Task Initiation email. (as required). • Monitor tasks and follow up by phone if a task owner has not advised completion of a task by the scheduled time, to ensure subsequent or dependent tasks are not delayed and can be started expediently. 5.1.3 Responsibilities of Cutover Task Owner Each task (or activity) owner is responsible for completing their tasks during Cutover, as follows: • Do not start a task until they are requested to by the CC. • Advise the CC promptly by return email when they commence the task. • Advise the CC promptly by email when they complete a task (including the actual duration) so CC can kick off subsequent tasks. • Immediately log with the CC any issue that arises during their cutover task(s) that results in/or is very likely to result in a delay or deviation in the Cutover schedule by more than 30 minutes. • Manage to resolution, any issues arising from their cutover task(s), with the assistance of the Cutover Control team. • Execute the task to completion, even if errors, issues and problems cause the task initiator to have to work beyond normal working hours. • Make accurate records/notes of any unplanned or exception issues/events so that they are available should analysis in the context of a future event be required. 5.1.4 Cutover Status Updates The CC will provide regular cutover status updates – for more details on Cutover Communication, see Section 7 - Communications. 5.1.5 Report & Manage Deployment Issues During the cutover, every issue, problem, question or deviation from the Cutover Plan will be recorded in a Cutover Issues Register. Each task initiator will be responsible for reporting any actual or potential deviation (outside of the agreed tolerance/thresholds) from the Cutover Plan to the CC. BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 19 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The CC will manage all issues/defects arising during cutover, escalate as required, and manage to resolution. The Cutover Issue Register will be reviewed as part of the “Lessons Learned” session, so that knowledge can be learnt prior to future cutovers. During BPIV, the volume of issues under management will rise significantly, so a more agile approach to issue resolution will be employed. This is demonstrated by the diagram below: Key Points to Note: - All issues will be added to the virtual BPIV Issue whiteboard. This will be the source of truth for anyone to monitor where all BPIV issues are at. - BPIV Control Room will remain logged into the BPIV Control Room meeting for the duration of BPIV. - Cutover Control will monitor BPIV Issue whiteboard and add Cutover Issue number as required. - BTM to advise BPIV Control Room once all of their scenarios have been successfully tested. - Issues found during BPIV will be logged directly into FCR as a Production SQR. Any outstanding SQRs at the completion of BPIV will be loaded into SNOW retrospectively to ensure a Production Support SQR is created for resolution post R4. Cutover Issue Resolution Process During the cutover, any task that deviates, or may cause a deviation from the Master Cutover Plan, to the extent that it may put Go-Live (or the Go-Live time) at risk must be escalated to the Cutover Control Centre. The CC will follow the issue resolution framework below to facilitate resolution of cutover issues: Cu tover Co ntr ol Team BPIV Team SME finds is sue w it h sc ne ari o SME, Dev l ead and BTM initial t ri age of iss ue in J el lybe an t eams meet ing Raise PROD SQR, li nk fai led scenarios and assi gn to DEV Le ad DEV t o Invest iga te / Resolve PROD SQR an d adv i se FA ST B PI V Le ad o nc e r ea dy f or m igr ati on Dev action Quick Fix and advise SME & BTM via JB tea ms on ce c om pl et e Qu ic k fi x?

Notify Cutover Control of the issue. This can be telephonically or via teams, so long as the conversation is followed up with an email confirming: • Task number and name • Details of the issue • Impact or potential impact • Proposed resolution (if one is known) • Recommended next steps Where the issue relates to a BPIV scenario, the following additional information should be supplied: • Number and name of failed B-PIV scenario • The IRD number that is being used to test this scenario • Confirmation the scenario been repeated / re-tested to eliminate user error as a possible cause • Whether or not the scenario has been re-tested with a different IRD number • Any technical requirements for the scenario to complete (e.g. a FAST batch process) Cutover Control Validate issue and log information in the Cutover Issue Register Tracking email is sent to the affected Deployment lead(s) containing • BT R4.0 | ISSUE NOTIFICATION | Issue #<ID>, <ISSUE TITLE> • Severity and details of the issue • Next steps Determine if issue should be managed by the Major Incident team, IT service des, or within the Programme by the Deployment Workstream. Major Incidents will support the Cutover by resolving network and environment issues, as well as facilitating approvals for any emergency change that R4 cutover is dependent on. The IT Service Desk will resolve any desktop related issues. BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 21 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Person Activity Major Incident team When notified of a major incident, the Major Incident team will record the incident in Service Now (SNOW) and follow the standard BAU processes to resolve the incident. During the resolution process, Cutover Control will be updated with the progress towards resolution (these updates in turn will be shared by the Control Centre with the Major Issue Updates comms group) Once Issue has been resolved, Cutover Control will be notified, and the incident will be closed in SNOW. Cutover Control Where issue relates to a programme/cutover issue, Cutover Control will work with the Workstream lead to resolve Workstream Lead Work with direct technical and/or business team to identify root cause. Determine solution, or potential solution options. If more than one option, will work closely with Cutover Control (who in turn will work with business representatives) to determine the impact of the different options and select the most appropriate course of action. Cutover Control will receive regular updates on the progress, (these updates will be shared with the Major Issue Updates comms group). Once the solution has been agreed, the fix (or work-around) will be implemented. Cutover Control Where a fix cannot be implemented (not enough time, or too complex), and a work-around is introduced, the issue will be handed over to the ELS team on conclusion of the Cutover. The Cutover Issue Register will be updated with any progress updates as well as the resolution. All impacted parties, as well as the Major Issue Updates Comms group will be updated with the resolution. Once the issue is closed, a final email will be sent to the Deployment lead(s) that worked on this issue to notify them that the issue should be considered as closed. The same Tracking email will be used throughout to ensure the email trail is clear to all. 5.2.1 Cutover Issue Severity & Escalations The Cutover Control Centre will be responsible to triage the issue with the required programme and/or business resources to determine the severity and impact. The Cutover Control team will make an informed decision on the severity, and therefore escalation, based on the type of issue and potential or actual impact, as per the tabled definitions below: Severity Issue Impact & Control Centre Action Escalation Point (1) Critical Impact: • Cutover is at risk and urgent action required to ensure overall success of the cutover; • Unable to fix within contingency window, will impact timing of official go live; • Rollback might be required. Control Centre Action: • Complex Issue Team engaged to support issue triage and next steps • Cross-workstream issue team organised to work on developing and testing potential fixes Hourly reporting on progress, or earlier if updates are available Deputy Commissioner Transformation OR BT R4 Go-live Committee BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 22 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Severity Issue Impact & Control Centre Action Escalation Point (2) High Impact: • Critical cutover task at risk. Scheduled run-time likely exceeded but fix forecasted to be implemented within allowable contingency window. • Critical path not yet impacted, but will be if fix not identified and implemented within contingency window; • Issue needs to be resolved before we go live; • Workaround may be available. Control Centre Action: • Complex Issue Team engaged to support issue triage and next steps • Cutover Issue Manager assigned • Two hourly reporting, or as updates become available. BT R4 Programme Manager (3) Medium Impact: • Cutover task at risk, but fix expected within the scheduled run-time of that task; • Issue confined to a single workstream and can be managed by that team; • Acceptable workaround available. Control Centre Action: • Cutover Issue Manager assigned to engage with workstream and facilitate resolution. BT R4 Deployment Lead (4) Low Impact: • Negligible impact to cutover task, reported primarily for visibility • No impact to cutover schedule, possibility a post go-live lesson learned to factor into future releases. Control Centre Action: • Issue logged and resolution tracked as a background task (noting that post go-live resolution may be an acceptable approach) • Issue reviewed post go-live for any potential lessons learned.

Business Severity of open issues In the event where issues are identified that cannot be resolved during the cutover, the issues will be carried into go live and a Production Support issue will be logged. The following severity definitions will be used: BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 24 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Severity Cutover Control Centre Action (1) High Major business impact, no work-around in place. (2) Medium Large business impact, work-around in place however not sustainable. (3) Low Minor business impact, sustainable work-around in place. (4) Insignificant No Business Impact, or negligible. BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 25 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6 Rollback Overview Rollback is the process of reverting R4 changes that have been applied to system code, system configuration, and or/or master data. These changes would be reverted to a stable R3 recovery point that was either just prior to the R4 cutover window commencing, or early within the R4 cutover window but prior to any material changes being implemented. Rollback would be invoked as a worst-case scenario during the BT cutover window if one or more business critical issues are identified and cannot be resolved or quarantined within the defined R4 cutover window. In this situation, there is a fundamental flaw(s) with the R4 solution build or data migration process that will compromise IR’s ability to deliver business/mission critical operations or meet legislative requirements – in this situation rollback to a stable, pre-cutover state of both system code/config and data is required before IR re-opens to both internal staff and external customers. The end-to-end BT R4 rollback sequence will require 30 hours to implement. Rollback Triggers Given the legislative and programme pressures to deploy the R4 solution in mid-April, most cutover issues will rely on a fix and roll-forward approach – this includes fixes that need to be applied following go-live and result in the business needing to endure some short-term pain. However, there are a few ‘show-stopping’ cutover issues that could trigger a rollback scenario. In order of their likeliness to trigger rollback, these are: • Converted Data Verification fails: there are multiple P1/P2 data issues that cannot be resolved prior to system and channel start-up. • Crown Reconciliation fails: In previous BT Release the key crown criteria for rollback was that there is no unexplained variance. Most R4 migrated products will be held to this standard, however it is expected that some level of variance is accepted for migrated KiwiSaver products as a result of historical data issues. A failure for KiwiSaver crown reconciliation is that this variance is not accepted for sign-off. • Business/mission critical BPIV scenarios fail: Noting that this would only trigger rollback under exceptional circumstances. Given BPIV runs past the rollback checkpoint; if a fix can’t be implemented within the remainder of the cutover window then it’s more likely that an interim work-around will be implemented, the relevant business units will be advised, and a fix and roll-forward approach be taken. 6.2.1 Rollback Checkpoints In line with the rollback triggers above, progress checkpoints have been built into the cutover schedule. These will be used to assess: • How we are tracking (both from a timing and quality perspective) to key R4 cutover tasks/events within the schedule, and depending on the outcome of this assessment; • Is there a need to invoke the rollback plan? While rollback can be invoked at any time, these checkpoints represent the most likely points in the R4 cutover schedule where are a decision to invoke rollback may be required. Rollback Checkpoint Description of Checkpoint Timing of Checkpoint 1 After completion of the FIRST / START data conversion and reconciliation Monday 13 th April at 4:00pm BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 26 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Rollback Checkpoint Description of Checkpoint Timing of Checkpoint 2 After completion of the Crown Reconciliation Tuesday 14 th April at 4:00pm 3 At successful conclusion of BPIV, just before the Checkpoint 4b go live approval meeting Wednesday 15 th April 4.30pm Rollback Scope, Sequence, and Timings The end-to-end BT R4 rollback sequence takes 30 hours. To meet the start-up requirement of having core systems (i.e. FIRST, START, CAS) online and available from 8am Thursday April 16 th , the drop- dead time to invoke rollback is 2am Wednesday April 15 th . The end-to-end rollback plan comprises the following high-level sequence and run times: • Rollback decision point (1 hour) • Technical rollback (15 hours): Technical rollback includes rollback of system code/config as well as data to an R3 state. Rollback of the DPS/CDC middleware component between FIRST and START is the longest running element of the technical rollback window. Rollback of START is expected to take 7 hours, after which co-ex and catch-up processing within START will kick- off – the start of this process this is not dependent on technical rollback of other systems. The system scope of R4 rollback, including the requirement for code rollback vs data rollback, is as follows: System Code/Config Rollback Data Rollback Comment ✓ ✓ Data recovery: restore from 8am April 10 th Code recovery: restore from 9pm April 9 th ✓ ✓ Data recovery: restore from 8am, April 10 th Code recovery: restore from 12pm April 6 th ✓ Retain latent R4 datasets (with change disabled for R4 datasets) ✓ Manual reversal of FMIS journal file ✓ Re-enable business user access and batch processing ✓ Re-deploy ‘n-1’ version ✓ Re-deploy ‘n-1’ version, retain latent R4 pipes ✓ Re-deploy ‘n-1’ version, includes heritage XIAMS changes ✓ Re-deploy ‘n-1’ version ✓ Re-deploy ‘n-1’ version ✓ Re-deploy ‘n-1’ version ✓ Re-deploy ‘n-1’ version • Co-existence processing (12 hours): Co-ex processing within START is the critical path during this portion of the rollback schedule. A 12hr full nightly job stream will be run, during this all co-ex files for FIRST will be generated and sent to the FIRST pick-up directory. • Rollback verification checks (5 hours): This includes 1hr to bring relevant systems and channels online, followed by 4 hours to test key rollback scenarios across the eServices, BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 27 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] contact centre, returns and forms, payments, and financials jellybeans. If scenarios are completed prior to 4hrs then the next tasks of the rollback schedule will be progressed. • System & Channel start-up (2 hrs): This includes the key technical start-up activities to enable core system access to IR business users, and B2B / Gateway Services accessible to external customers. • Catch-up processing: This runs beyond the R4 rollback window and includes the following events and cross-system exchanges: o processing of consolidated EI file from START (backlog from April 3 rd onwards) o E- File backlog (held since April 7) o misdirected payments o IIT (Individual INC Returns) o Tax Agent EOT, ARP Payments) During the following week, the FIRST contingency solution will be deployed in order to allow for key Legislative changes for R4 products to be support by FIRST. It should be noted that the deployment approach will always be to resolve any technical problem and roll forward. Rollback is the final option if the BT R4.0 solution is not stable, or crown/data reconciliation failed and sign- off is not obtained. The high-level sequence diagram below illustrates the sequencing of the rollback process: BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 28 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 7 Communications Cutover Communications Plan 7.1.1 Cutover Stand-up meetings During the cutover period, there will be two daily stand-up meetings. The purpose of these meetings is to ensure a shared and consistent understanding of current progress, issues under management, and key next steps. The stand-up meetings will be run via the Microsoft Teams App (details will be included in the email invitation). The Cutover team stand-ups will be run daily at 8am and 6:30pm (with the first session planned for Thursday 9 th April at 8am). Duration 15 minutes Purpose Confirm Task Status (started, in-progress, complete) and update on any open issues. Issue management occurs outside of this meeting. Attendance: Cutover Control, Workstream Leads, Programme Manager. Stand-up meetings will also be done for key Progress Checkpoints.

Issue notifications will be sent through email to the stakeholders identified as required for the regular communications and will continue on a regular basis until the issue has been resolved. The content of the email will be: • Unique Issue Tracking number • Deployment Central Issue owner • Severity • Issue description (what went wrong and the impact) • Next Steps: Investigation / Resolution (progress towards the resolution) BT Release 4 – Deployment Approach & Plan Page 31 of 41 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 8 Post Cutover activities Following go-live of the BT R4 solution and exit of the R4 cutover window, two key streams of BT R4 work kick-off: • Early Life Support: a period of heightened production support to ensure stability of the R4 solution over the months immediately following R4 cutover. • BT R4 Deployment close-out: a retrospective on BT R4 deployment planning and execution to identify opportunities and areas for improvement that can be applied to BT R5 deployment. Early Life Support – Pou Whirinaki At the successful completion of the cutover, there will be a period of Early Life Support (ELS) that will run until the 30 th of September 2020. Included in this is a period of Hypercare, where BT staff will be onsite to support IR staff with the new solution. ELS will be managed by \[Information redacted\] for the agreed period and will provide the processes and support to ensure a smooth resolution of post- implementation incidents, problems, and information requirements by: • Managing and co-ordinating all technical queries and issues while working closely with the programme, vendors’ and Information Technology & Change (IT&C) teams. • Managing and co-ordinating all business process queries and issues while working closely with the SMEs and the business support teams. The ELS Team will also work closely with IT&C over this period to make sure that all the handover collateral is available and understood, and that IT&C are ready to support both the technology solution and the associated business processes as required. Details of the Early Life Support process and procedures can be found in the Early Life Support Strategy document. Deployment Close-out & Lessons Learned At the end of the BT R4.0 Cutover, Lessons Learned sessions will be held by the BT Cutover team with each of the key cutover stakeholders. The purpose of these sessions is to review the success of the cutover process, identify any lessons learned (good or bad), and to come up with remedies to address flaws in the process for future BT cutovers.

Classified In Confidence: Inland Revenue Highly Protected \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] BT Transition to BAU Overview Document: BT Major Release Deployment Framework Version: 1.0 FINAL (HURINGA REFERENCE DOCUMENT) Author: BT Deployment Services Date: November 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Overview and Context | Purpose of this Document This document details the deployment framework that developed by the BT Deployment Services team to ensure a consistent approach to the planning and execution of BT major release cutovers. The Deployment Services team is a BT function that will not endure beyond BT, and as such, the purpose of this document is to: •Serve as a transition artefact– a “how-to” support guide for major release deployment planning at IR. This will be available beyond the life of the BT programme for reference by IR’s enduring release and deployment function(s). •Define the explicit processesf or planning, rehearsing, and executing the Deployment & Cutover of a BT major release. •Document implicit/tacit knowledgea ccumulated by the BT Deployment Services team across 5+ years of involvement with BT and 6 major release deployment & cutover cycles. This document is split into four topic areas: #TopicOverview 1a High level deployment framework Introduces the three phases of deployment that guide the planning and execution process, as well the granular set of tasks that underpin each phase. 1b Detailed deployment framework Focuses on each granular tasks associated with the high level deployment framework and provides a number of topic areas, key questions to answer, and further considerations. 2 Deployment capabilities Provides a high level view of the different capabilities and skillsets required; (a) within the BT Deployment Services team, and (b) more broadly within the BT programme or IR organisation, to reliably plan for and execute the deployment & cutover of a BT major release. 3Deployment sizing framework Introduces a guide for sizing the deployment/cutover footprint of a release. This is to reflect that BT major release cutovers are exceptionally large and complex, and that these types of events are much less likely once the BT-led transition from Heritage to START has completed. NOTEthis document captures current state processes and knowledge as it relates to the Deployment Services team in a BT context. In referencing this please, please note: •This document DOES NOT detail the roles and responsibilities of other BT/BAU teams that are required to support the d eployment and cutover planning – e.g. org change management and training, data purification, release readiness, hypercare & early life support. •This document should not be used as an official IR framework for deployment and cutover planning, but rather as a tool to s upplement quality and right-sized deployment & cutover processes. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Overview & Context | BT Deployment Services Team The Deployment Services team is a BT function that was established during Stage 1 of IR’s Business Transformation programme. Throughout the course of BT, Deployment Services has been responsible for: 1.Leading the integrated deployment & cutover activities associated w ith each BT major release. This broadly covers three domains: oBusiness deployment planning – e nsuring impacted business units understand and execute tasks required of them to; (a) successfully prepare for a BT major release to be deployed to IR’s production environment, and (b) transition through the disruptive cutover period and adjust to new ways of working following go-live. oTechnical deployment – e nsuring all system code/configuration changes and data changes required to deploy a BT major release to IR’s technology production environment have been planned for and are validated. oIntegrated deployment planning– e nsuring; (a) a fully integrated cutover plan with correct sequencing and dependencies between all business and technical deployment tasks, (b) stakeholder groups active in the cutover understand in detail the deployment tasks assigned to them and have been involved in at least one rehearsal of the integrated cutover plan, (c) any areas of overlap/dependency in the cutover plan between different groups or systems have been thoroughly workshopped and planned with input from all relevant stakeholder groups. 2.Assuming the role of ‘Cutover Control’ during major release cutovers – i .e. the integrator function that owns the master cutover plan, orchestrates the various teams involved through cutover, and facilities triage and resolution of cutover issues.

Included in this: •Extract / Transform / Load of Heritage data into START, and reconciliation to verify that data has been accurately converted. •Crown Revenue reconciliation to verify thatrevenue associated with the migrated products has been unaffected by data conversion and continues to reconcile. •System upgrades required to shift the ownership of tax & social policy products from IR’s Heritage platform to the enduring START Core Tax & Social Policy solution. •System co-existence processing dependencies that must be completed during cutover – as well as managing dependencies with partnering organisations that are disrupted by cutover (e.g. file exchanges). 2.An outage to IR’s core systems (e.g. FIRST, START) and channels (e.g. myIR, Contact Centre, Gateway Services) to ensure a stable production environment necessary for data migration to run uninterrupted. These outages have spanned one or more business days and have had significant impact to customer and business stakeholder groups. 3.Legislative change that is built into the deployed system/channel upgrades. The effective date for legislation often dictates when the major release must be deployed and go-live – as well as detailed contingency ‘plan B’ for enforcing legislative changes if the technical solution is not ready to go-live in time. During the BT Programme the Deployment Services team have been responsible for the deployment planning & cutover execution for START major releases. As such, the BT Deployment Framework detailed in this document has been developed in response to the deployment andcutover characteristic associated with the START major releases – as detailed in the boxes below. START Stage 1 •Migrated to START: GST •Go-live: February 2017 •Duration: 3 days START Release 2 •Migrated to START: Withholding tax, Gaming Machine Duty, Fringe Benefit Tax •Go-live: April 2018 •Duration: 3.5 days START Release 3 •Migrated to START: Income Tax, WfFTC •Go-live: April 2019 •Duration: 7.5 days START Release 4 •Migrated to START: KiwiSaver, Student Loans, PAYE •Go-live: April 2020 •Duration: 7 days START Stage 4, Release 1 •Migrated to START: PPL, Unclaimed Money, Duties, NZ Foreign Trusts •Go-live: February 2021 Characteristics of a BT START Major ReleaseBT Examples NOTEthat START major release cutovers have been highly complex and long running. Most START releases beyond BT should have a significantly smaller cutover footprint for which many of the processes in this documented Deployment Framework will either not be requiredor at least require a significantly scaled effort. Section 4 of this document provides a framework to guide the right sizing of this Deployment Framework for future post-BT releases that will likely have significantly simpler cutovers. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 1.

Key Cutover exit criteria met: •Business deployment and technical cutover tasks complete within the approved cutover outage window. •Verification checks have proven the deployed solution is functioning as expected, no business-critical defects. •Reconciliation of migrated data and crown revenue has passed. Key ELS exit criteria met: •The deployed change has been successfully embedded within business operations and heightened support is no longer required. •The volume of solution-related defects has stabilised, heightened triage and issue response processes can ramp-down. •Review of the deployment planning and delivery activities has provided material improvements to carry forward to the next release cycle. •Any open items have been assigned to the relevant teams for follow up and action. •Deployment approach has been agreed – there is a plan for when the release will be deployed and what must happen beforehand. •Cutover is understood and planned for – e.g. size of window, outage requirements, impact to business and customer groups and work- arounds to minimise this. Key Deployment Outcomes BT Deployment Framework The Phases and Activities Required in Deploying a BT Major Release The BT Deployment Framework captures the end-to-end set of deployment-related activities that must be completed for any given BTmajor release. Each deployment phase and respective set of activities is underpinned by a subset of artefacts, topic areas, and key questions &considerations. These are overviewed on the following slides, and then in detail in section 1b of this document. Handover ELS to BAU Review and Exit ELS Deployment activities that have been the responsibility of BT Deployment Services. This framework documents these tasks in detail. Deployment activities that have been the responsibility of other BT workstreams or BAU units. Detail on these tasks are not included in this deployment framework. Key ‘Wrap-around’ functions required to support and/or guide the deployment planning and implementation of a BT major release. Details on these tasks are not included in this deployment framework. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] BT Deployment Framework | Overview Pre-deployment Phase Artefact / EventPurpose (artefact) Deployment Strategy and Approach Describes at a high level how changes will be deployed to production, providing enough detail to guide detailed deployment planning and inform impacts on other workstreams within the release.

Post-deployment Purpose & Structure The purpose of the Pre-deployment phase is to identify the technical and business requirements necessary to successfully deploy a release, and to develop an approach and plan for how these requirements will be delivered. This up-front period of deployment planning and design enables the detailed cutover plan to be built and subsequently rehearsed and validated during the ‘Deployment’ phase. For BT Major Releases, the pre-deployment phase comprises two sub-phases: 1.Deployment Strategy & Approach.Defines at a high level how the changes (business and/or technical) associated with a release will be transitioned to the production environment, with consideration given to: oWhat is being deployed – i.e. the scope of the release. There may be technical system/data changes, business process changes, legislative changes, amongst others. The strategy needs to identify the areas of deployment complexity and risk and establish an approach to manage this risk and allow the successful deployment of the release. oWhen to deploy – i.e. cutover window options analysis. This is typically driven by the scope of change, complexity of change being deployed, and forecasted cutover runtime. BT Major Release cutovers require system and channel downtime to deploy. Outage windows should not conflict with key customer and business events. oHow to prove the deployment plan – what level of testing (i.e. deployment rehearsals) is required to build confidence in the deployment approachand cutover plan? 2.Detailed Deployment Design. Extending the high-level deployment strategy and deployment approach plans into a more detailed and executable plan. This involves the following for BT major releases: oProduct transition plans, which detail how business processing and customer events will be reliably transitioned through a period of disruption during the cutover window. Transition plans are almost definitely required for those tax and social policy products that are in scope of the release. Transition plans for other products may also be required if their BAU schedule is impacted by a system and/or channel outage required for cutover. oCutover task planning – Details the granular set of tasks and people required to deploy technical system/data changes and/or support business transition through the cutover period. This is captured in an integrated cutover run-sheet that also identifies dependencies between tasks as well as expected runtimes and critical path duration. Artefacts & Events \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] BT Deployment Framework | Overview Deployment Phase Purpose & Structure The purpose of the Deployment phase is to action the detailed deployment plan – by first rehearsing, refining, and validating the detailed plan before then using this plan to deploy the release to IR’s production environment. For larger releases the deployment phase is typically coupled with a period of enterprise change control – whereby other change activity is prevented OR minimised and closely monitored, in order to ensure a consistent and stable environment for the eventual production deployment. The deployment phase comprises three sub-phases: 1.Cutover Rehearsal(s) & Preparation. Pr actising of the detailed deployment run-sheets under production-like conditions, including: oDeploying technical changes to the QUAL / staging environment (i.e. the ‘n- 1 ’ environment on the path to production) oUsing the same people that will be involved for the production cutover oMaking use of the deployment practices and rituals that will be used for p roduction cutover (e.g. issue management, comms, task tracking, etc.) Multiple fully integrated rehearsals are required for longer running, complex, high risk cutovers – such as the BT major releases. This is necessary in order to fully validate and prove the complex cutover plan prior to attempting to cutover in the production environment. 2.Cutover. T he period of deploying technical changes to the production environment and/or transitioning business processes to the new solution. Typically comprises a standard pattern of events: oRamp-d own business activity and system processing shut-down systems, channels, and business/customer activity deploy and verify system and data changes receive approval to go-live start-up system, channel and business/customer activity complete any business/system catch-up processing. 3.Stabilisation/ELS. A time limited period of enhanced support immediately following cutover when system stability issues and business transition challenges are most likely. ELS is typically supplemental to existing BAU support process. The ELS period for BT major releases has not been managed by the BT Deployment Services team. As such, go-live approval and system / channel start-up have typically serves as a handover point from the Deployment Services team to the ELS team. Artefact / EventPurpose (event)Deployment Integration Forum Regular meeting to maintain alignment of planning and progress, discuss key risks and issues, track readiness, and socialise relevant deployment artefacts amongst those workstreams directly involved in the release deployment. (event) Enterprise Change Control Enforcing a period of reduced change or no change in order to maintain environment stability in the lead-up to production cutover. (artefact)Cutover rehearsal plan and run- sheet Confirm scope of cutover rehearsal, and adapting production cutover schedule accordingly. (event) Cutover rehearsalPractising the execution of the cutover run-sheet in order to validate if cutover exit criteria can be met with the cutover plan as it currently stands, or if further refinement and updates are required. (artefact) Cutover rehearsal exit report Describes the outcome of the dress rehearsal lessons learned, if the objectives were achieved and makes a recommendation if another dress rehearsal is required. Deployment Readiness Checkpoint #2 Are we ready to proceed with deploying the release to IR’s production environment? (event) Production Cutover Dedicated window during which all elements of the new solution are deployed to production – i.e. technical system and data updates, transition of business processes etc. (artefact) Go-live decision report Describes the outcome of cutover and details the results of each exit criteria. Deployment Readiness Checkpoint #3 Are we ready to go-live with the deployed release and re-open IR’s core systems and channels? (event) ELSHeightened monitoring and support while the solution stabilises across technical and/or business domains. NB: This is out of scope for Deployment Services. Artefacts & Events 1. Pre-deployment2. Deployment3. Post-deployment \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] BT Deployment Framework | Overview Post-Deployment Phase ArtefactPurpose (artefact) Deployment Close-out Report Describes the key lessons learned from the Readiness, Deployment Planning and Cutover stages of a release and how those lessons will be turned into improvements for future deployment approaches. (artefact) ELS Exit Report Describes the outcome of ELS, documents and proves that exit criteria have been met, and details any open issues and their resolution plan. Deployment Readiness Checkpoint #4 Are we ready to exit the intensive support and fully transition support of the deployed release to BAU support processes. Purpose & Structure The purpose of the Post-deploymentphase is to formally acknowledge the completion of all deployment activity, and to exit the deployment phase. The post-deployment phase is typically split between: 1.Deployment/Cutover close-o ut. This typically involves a series of deployment retrospectives with the relevant technical and business deployment groups that were involved throughout the deployment planning, rehearsal, and cutover phases. These sessions focus on identifying: oWhat went well and should be continued in future releases? oWhat could have been planned/managed/implemented better and s hould be stopped or done differently in future? 2.ELS exit and close-ou t.Formal exit of the ELS phase will require proof of a number of stabilisation exit criteria being met, such as: oNo open significant issues (i.e. sev 1 / sev 2) associated with the d eployed changes. oOther open defects are under control – i .e. sev 3/4 defects have been remediated or there is an action plan to resolve these. oSolution stability – i .e. technical and business service levels are being met and there is confidence in BAU support structures being able to sustain this. oHandover complete –i .e. technical and business knowledge has been transferred to respective BAU units.

Deployment Planning Rehearsals & Preparation CutoverStabilisationDeployment Review DP1DP2DP3DP4 BT Deployment Framework Deployment Planning Phase | Key Questions & Considerations Topic AreasKey Question & Areas for ConsiderationHuringa Artefact(s) Release scope KEY QUESTION | What’s in scope for change with the release, how will this influence cutover planning? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Systems/Channels.What systems/channels are having changes deployed to them, do these changes require a full outage to implement, and if so does this have a downstream impact to other systems/channels/services also being unavailable during the change window? (e.g. an outage to START would also require myIR, Gateway Services, and Contact Centre to be offline). •Legislation.Are there any legislative changes coupled with the release, if so what is the effective date for the new legislation or is there potential to influence this? Are system changes required to support new legislation, if so must the system changes be in place by this date or is the change less-tightly coupled to the effective date? What is the contingency plan for meeting legislative requirements if system changes are not ready to be deployed by the legislative effective date? •Data migration.What products are in scope for migration, what are the key cyclic business events associated with these products? These will need to be considered in determining when to cutover. •External changes.Are changes required to system(s) of one or more partnering agencies/organisations or customer groups? Can the deployment and go-live of changes IR-side be decoupled from external partner-led changes? If not, how will this external delivery risk (and dependency) be managed? •People.Whichunits/roles will be required to support deployment planning and how will they be managed – i.e. roles and responsibilities during deployment planning and deployment phases. Which vendors must be engaged? n/a, Release scope is used to provide context in the Deployment Strategy. Typically scope will lead to deployment-related challenges that will require a strategic response to be thought through – e.g. what is changing, how do we transition this change from ‘old’ to ‘new’ through the cutover period. Cutover outages and impact to business operations & customer events / expectations KEY QUESTION | What is the likely duration of cutover and any associated system/channel disruptions? Do these outages cause impact to business and/or customer groups and if so how can this be minimised? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Cutover sequence & duration. What is the high-level sequence of tasks that must be completed during the cutover window? Based on early analysis what is the expected runtime for completing each task? •Cutover disruption & options to minimise.What options are there to minimise business and customer impact caused by system/channel outages for cutover? Options include: o Re-sequencing. Condensing the cutover window by shifting long running cutover tasks to run in parallel. o Pre-deploy viable technical components. Explore options to pre-deploy applicable components of the solution – particularly if this reduces the runtime or technical risk associated with the main production cutover window. Pre-deployments typically involve components that can be deployed to production in a silent state and are then activated during the main production cutover window. “Major Release Deployment, High Level Cutover Block Diagram”. An early draft of the high level plan cutover plan that provides an indicative view of task sequencing, run time, associated system & channel outages. Deployment Strategy Deployment Design Detailed Deployment & Cutover Planning Deployment Strategy Phase |The strategy is the starting point for planning the deployment of a release. The Deployment Strategy is informed by inputs relevant to the release and provides just enough guidance on how the deployment will be completed – to inform more detailed deployment planning that will be defined in later deployment deliverables. IN CONFIDENCE – EXTERNAL RELEASE Topic AreasKey Question & Areas for ConsiderationHuringa Artefact(s) Cutover window options assessment KEY QUESTION | When should the release be deployed to production? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Cyclic Events.Many IR events run on monthly or annual cadences. These times coincide with periods of higher business processing and customer activity (e.g. Returns filing and associated payments) and should be avoided for disruptive cutover events that require system/channel outages. oCrown reporting . Typically runs the first 7 business days of the calendar month. oEmployer deduction payments . Due by the 20 th of each month, extra payment due the 5 th for large employers. oCustomer disbursements . Social policy products such as Child Support, Working for Families, and Paid Parental Leave pay customers on weekly or fortnightly basis. These payments may need to be rescheduled to avoid any payment runs coinciding with a disruptive cutover window. oPeak season processing periods : Families Peak season runs Feb-March. Income Tax peak season runs March – May. System/Channel outages due to cutover over these time will need to give special consideration for how business workload and customer activity might be impacted. April is also the beginning of the new tax year and often coincides with legislative changes coming into effect. oVolumes Analysis . How do customer volumes vary across key channels (e.g. myIR – login volumes and web requests, Gateway Services, Contact Centre call volumes). Cutover outages should coincide with lower volume periods to minimise customer disruption. •Minimising impact of cutover outages: Can cutover be completed outside of business hours, for example: oOvernight : Contact Centre shuts from 8pm – this is typically the last dependency for core system access. oWeekend : Contact Centre runs through to 1pm Saturday and re-opens 8am Monday. This is typically the last dependency for core system access (though consideration must also be given to the peak season periods and whether there is any planned overtime work scheduled for Saturday and/or Sunday). oExtended public holiday weekend : Contact Centre and front of house are shut for public holidays, and sometimes Saturday too if the public holiday falls on that day. oCustomer exemptions : If a disruptive cutover is near to, or contends with, a key filing and payment date, then late filing/payment penalties may need to be relaxed to avoid unfair customer penalties. •Approval.Who is required to approve any system/channel/business outage, and approve the cutover window? •Contingency.What’s the back-up date for deploying changes? “Major Release Deployment, Cutover Window Recommendation – Analysis”. Documented analysis to identify the most suitable window to run the production cutover event. Analysis to determine the ‘most suitable window’ often balances minimising business & customer impact against meeting delivery deadlines. This analysis is used to receive formal governance approval of the cutover window. “Major Release Deployment, Cutover Window Recommendation – Governance Paper”. This is an example of an executive-level paper that was presented to IR Governance (EPPC or PGC) in seeking approval for a recommended window of time in which to run a BT major release cutover.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Products migrating to new system/platform.These typically need to be ramped down to a quiet point prior to cutover to support their successful migration – what associated processes must be stopped prior to cutover, and by when? •Other products/events overlapping with cutover. Products may not be in scope for change or migration to new system, however they have key business processing or customer activity that overlaps with cutover. Does this need to be rescheduled to avoid the cutover outage (e.g. weekly/fortnightly customer payments)? “Major Release Deployment, Product Transition Approaches”. An early draft on how key products and associated business or customer events will transition through cutover outage (NB: to be refined during ‘Deployment Design’ activity). Managing Contention with the Enterprise Release Plan KEY QUESTION | Are there other initiatives with similar delivery timeframes that contend with one another and introduce constraints. KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Identify contention between different releases.Are there other approved releases following a similar delivery timeline, if so what types of constraints does this introduce: oEnvironment limitations .Are there separate pathways to production for each release, or must they pass through the same non-production environments prior to deploying to production? If different pathways are not possible then how will separate code bases between the two releases be managed? If technical contention can’t be worked around then is there a need to reschedule one of the initiatives? oResource limitations. Are key technical or business SMEs or vendors occupied with other releases? •Maintaining a view of other releases.How will progress with other releases be monitored to ensure their risk / issues / schedule delays don’t have a downstream impact. n/a, Requires interfacing with Enterprise Change and Release function, as well as any other programmes of work that are delivery change at the same time. Lessons learned from previous releases KEY QUESTION | How can the deployment & cutover planning, rehearsal, and delivery be improved based on previous experience? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •What insight has been gained from similar releases in the past – both for items that; 1) went well and should continue, and 2) caused issues and should be improved or avoided? n/a, typically covered as a section in the Deployment Strategy. Strategic Response to Deployment Planning KEY QUESTION |What principals and guiding approaches should be agreed to direct the subsequent more detailed levels of deployment planning? “Major Release Deployment, Deployment Strategy”.High level document that sets the strategic direction for further deployment planning and implementation of the release(s).

KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Approach to proving cutover.How will cutover be rehearsed prior to the production deployment? oNumber of rehearsals . e.g. a single deployment to QUAL (suitable for small/medium sized releases) vs. multiple mock go-live cutover rehearsals (suitable for larger releases with more complex change that will require rehearsals to prove the end-to-end cutover process). o Simulating production-like conditions. Should cutover rehearsals be performed under production-like conditions –e.g. running 24/7, performing all technical cutover tasks as well as cutover management & comms practices? oOutcomes . What must be achieved during each cutover rehearsal to prove readiness for production cutover? oSchedule for rehearsals . When will rehearsals be performed. Scheduling must factor in other delivery items (e.g. testing), people availability, and environment availability. •Technical environment management.How will non-prod environments be managed to support cutover rehearsals, including: oData Refreshes . Which environments must be refreshed with unscrambled production data to enable cutover data processing tasks to be accurately rehearsed (e.g. data migration & reconciliation)? oData Refresh Snapshots . When should these snapshots be sourced from production –i.e. are there any relevant business/customer events that run prior to production cutover and materially change datasets that are in scope of the release? Snapshots may need to run following these events to ensure cutover tasks are rehearsed on data that will best reflect it’s state at the time of production cutover. oPathway to production . Which non-production environment will code be progressed through? Are these environments available to use and reflective of the production environment, or is there contention with other initiatives or BAU activity? •Roll-out options.How will the release be deployed to the business and how will technical changes be deployed? o Business Roll-out: Phased approach (e.g. progressive rollout to different business units) vs big-bang approach? oTechnical Deployment : De-risk production cutover window by pre-deploying viable technical components, or deploy all technical changes during a single cutover window? •Deployment Management. How will the end-to-end deployment cycle be managed? oManagement model . Federated model (e.g. central integrator & management function with workstreams / functional groups reporting into) vs. centralised single unit vs. hybrid model. oRoles & Responsibilities . What are the requirements of each unit (for federated model) or role (for centralised model) to support deployment? How do roles, responsibilities, and reporting lines vary between the different deployment phases (i.e. planning  rehearsals final preparation cutover)? •Approach to Deployment Readiness.Is there an overarching readiness framework (e.g. separately assessing readiness across business, customer, and programme domains)?, andat what point in the release cycle are readiness assessments required? How will readiness assessments differ between major releases vs. any minor/pre-deployment releases? What governance is required for readiness reporting and deciding to; (a) enter the cutover and, (b) exit the cutover window or rollback? What roles and responsibilities are required for readiness assessments? “Major Release Deployment, Deployment and Cutover Approach”. Details how the deployment will be managed, rehearsed, and proven prior to production cutover. (NB: typically also details the production cutover approach – refer to next page). “Major Release Deployment, Environment Data Refresh Plan for Cutover Rehearsals” Details which environments will be refreshed, timing of refreshes and production snapshots, and details of administrative change request & approval activity. This is typically accompanied with environment bookings via the Environment Usage Dashboard. Release checkpoint plan and readiness assessment framework.NOTE this was not owned by BT Deployment. Deployment Planning Rehearsals & Preparation CutoverStabilisationDeployment Review DP1DP2DP3DP4 Deployment StrategyDeployment Design Detailed Deployment & Cutover Planning BT Deployment Framework Deployment Planning Phase | Key Questions & Considerations Deployment Design Phase |The purpose of the design phase is to build out the direction-setting approach established in the Deployment Strategy into actionable deployment approaches and plans. These set the high level approach for proving the cutover process, demonstrating readiness to proceed with cutover, and how the cutover event itself will be run and managed. IN CONFIDENCE – EXTERNAL RELEASE Topic AreasKey Question & Areas for ConsiderationHuringa Artefact(s) Cutover Approach KEY QUESTION | How will the production cutover be sequenced, managed, and controlled to best position the release for a successful go-live? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Cutover sequence & execution.What is the high-level sequence of cutover tasks and their indicative runtimes: oAre there areas of high risk in the cutover schedule (e.g. long-running tasks and associated system outages, complex migration/reconciliation tasks), how will these be mitigated through the deployment approach (e.g. multiple rehearsals)? oAre there key milestones through cutover? These are often progress checkpoints that are tied to the outcome of major cutover tasks that feed into the go-live decision (e.g. data migration or financial reconciliations). oWho is required to implement each component of the cutover sequence – is it an outsourced service that requires vendor support or is it managed internally to IR? •People planning & logistics. How will cutover resources be planned and engaged. Are there HR requirements to consider (e.g. after-hours work or long-running shifts?), what support arrangements will be required for after- hours work (e.g. transport and/or accommodation arrangements, health & safety arrangements)? •Cutover Management Practices.Who will be responsible for the Cutover Control function, and what practices are required to ensure cutover is run in a controlled manner? oTask initiation . How will cutover task doers be instructed to begin their cutover task? How/when will they provide updates back to Cutover Control on progress, issues, and completion of their action(s)? oCutover location . Will cutover be performed on-site in an office space, completed remotely, or a hybrid mix between the two? How will cutover control practices be enforced across these two different modes of working? oProgress Checkpoints . How frequently will the cutover team come together to provide an update on progress of the integrated cutover schedule? Who must attend these updates? oCutover Update Communications . How will updates on cutover progress be communicated (e.g. 2 hourly, twice daily), and through what channels (e.g. email, conference calls, messaging application)? oIssue Management . What is the process for triaging and resolving cutover issues? What are the thresholds for escalating to programme leadership / executive leadership? oIntegration with BAU Functions . What Service Management functions should be included in cutover progress and issue updates for visibility and support purposes (e.g. Major Incidents, Enterprise Change, Service Desk / desktop support)? oSupporting tools . For each cutover management practice, what tool(s) supporting tools will be used and are they easy and secure to access for IR staff and vendors involved in cutover? •Cutover entry criteria.What cutover readiness items must be completed as part of the final release readiness assessment to gain formal approval to proceed with the production cutover? •Cutover exit criteria.What specific criteria must be met to prove cutover was successful and the go-live decision can be endorsed? “Major Release Deployment, Deployment and Cutover Approach”. Details the controls that will be used to manage the cutover window (NB: typically combined with the deployment approach referenced on the previous slide). “Major Release Deployment, High Level Cutover Block Diagram”. Further iteration of the early draft that was produced during the Deployment Strategy phase. This updated view informs some of the topic areas covered in the cutover approach – e.g. cutover risk areas, milestones, people/support requirements (NB: to be further refined during the detailed cutover planning phase).

KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Shutdown & outage requirements: Is there a need to take systems/channels offline to deploy the change? oChannel vs. System shutdown . Is there a need to stagger the shutdown of channels (e.g. myIR) and systems (e.g. START) to ensure any in-flight business or customer activity has time to pass through and store in their respective back-end system OR can in-flight transactions be reliably held, allowing for a simpler shutdown in which channels and systems are shutdown in parallel? oData conversion . For products that are being migrated between systems, is there a need to stop relevant BAU processing in the day(s) leading up to cutover to allow the data to reach a stable, quiet point prior to data migration? If so, is user lock-out required to support this ramp-down period? o Broadcasting outages internally in the lead-up to cutover. How will system and channel outages be communicated to IR business units – e.g. Process Integrity Snapshots, Service Alert widget on IR intranet homepage, Featured News articles, Executive email, integration forums, START broadcast messages? oBroadcasting outages externally during the cutover . How will customer impacting outage be communicated? Who will draft these messages and ensure they deployed to their appropriate channel? oContact Centre – outage message applied to 0800 numbers. omyIR – outage splash page on myIR login page, xIAMS maintenance mode applied (only used if myIR must be opened for PIV activity during cutover and specific users must be whitelisted for access). oGateway Services – outage Splash page applied to production URLs. oIRD website –Outage banner applied to IR SiteCore website. oWhat other channels can be used to communicate the outage – e.g. Outage banners applied to IR website, Service Outage page on IR website, marketing campaigns (radio/TV), social channels, Account Management team liaising with key external partners (e.g. other government agencies, banks, tax bodies etc.)? oExternal interfaces . Can these remain online but in an idle state (e.g. accept and hold files/messages from externals) or must they be shut completely? If so which external partners and specific interfaces are impacted and how will shutdown be run in a controlled manner to ensure final messages/files are confirmed as being sent and received by the respective parties? What should the external agencies do on their end to hold messages? oOutage start time. Can system/channel outages be deferred to start outside of business hours (e.g. 5pm, or 8pm if accounting for Contact Centre) or are there technical dependencies that require the outage to begin earlier in the day? “Major Release Deployment, Cutover Shutdown-Startup Block Diagrams”.High-level view of the sequence in which key channels and systems will shutdown and start-up, noting: •This is often detailed in the Deployment & Cutover Approach given it’s relevance to the cutover event. •This is a first draft that will be refined during the detailed cutover planning phase. “Major Release Deployment, Shutdown and Start-up Approach for IR Partnering Organisations”.This approach document overviews those external organisations that share information via a digital interface with IR. Awareness of the timing of these exchanges is necessary for cutovers with outages that will result in disruption. Planning may be required to arrange out-of-cycle exchanges prior to and following cutover. Deployment Planning Rehearsals & Preparation CutoverStabilisationDeployment Review DP1DP2DP3DP4 Deployment StrategyDeployment Design Detailed Deployment & Cutover Planning BT Deployment Framework Deployment Planning Phase | Key Questions & Considerations IN CONFIDENCE – EXTERNAL RELEASE Topic AreasKey Question & Areas for ConsiderationHuringa Artefact(s) Shutdown / start-up approach (continued from previous page) KEY QUESTION | What systems & channels must be shut to enable the cutover to proceed under stable conditions? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Start-up. How to successfully bring systems and channels back online and verify full service availability? oSequencing . Is there a specific system start-up sequence that must be followed to avoid unintended errors? E.g. Core systems brought up before channels. o Verifying start-up. Are any checks required to prove that system/channel start-up completed successfully? E.g. confirming login to relevant systems, monitoring relevant B2B inbound/outbound B2B messaging and file exchanges. o Soft go-live. Is there an opportunity to bring systems online prior to the communicated start-up? This provides time for the cutover team to run their own verification checks in the live production environment, while also monitoring low levels of external activity. A soft launch is typically only possible if the cutover runs ahead of schedule and start-up can run earlier than expected OR if the added time this approach would add to the shutdown period is approved ahead of cutover. oContingency planning . If cutover delays are encountered, does the cutover schedule allow for system/channel start-up to be deferred without significant impact to business and customer groups? If start-up is scheduled for outside of business hours then this typically provides contingency where the start-up is delayed. oHandover to ELS and ProdQA teams . At what point in the start-up approach is cutover considered completed and can the handover to the ELS support team commence? (Refer to previous slide) Deployment Planning Rehearsals & Preparation CutoverStabilisationDeployment Review DP1DP2DP3DP4 Deployment StrategyDeployment Design Detailed Deployment & Cutover Planning BT Deployment Framework Deployment Planning Phase | Key Questions & Considerations IN CONFIDENCE – EXTERNAL RELEASE Topic AreasKey Question & Areas for ConsiderationHuringa Artefact(s) Rollback approach KEY QUESTION | What would cause a rollback during the cutover window and how would this be sequenced, managed, and potentially rehearsed to ensure rollback to a stable recovery point is possible? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Scope. What technical changes must be restored to their pre-cutover state? Consideration to both code/config changes applied to system and data changes. •Rollback triggers. What issues would trigger rollback, as opposed to taking a fix and roll-forward approach? oRuntime . Cutover is delayed and can’t be complete within an acceptable timeframe. oMigration/data issues . Data migration and/or reconciliation results do not pass, and the variance isn’t accepted (e.g. root cause of variance unknown) or can’t be resolved within the cutover window. oMajor functional issues . Business critical functions are not working correctly and will result in unacceptable business consequences and reputational harm to IR if go-live proceeds. •Rehearsal approach.How should rollback be rehearsed (e.g. it may be a simple exercise that is proven through regular environment refresh tasks)? What elements of rollback scope should be rehearsed (i.e. focus on areas of complexity, areas that are untested, or the full scope of rollback)? •Rollback Roles & Responsibilities. Rollback governance / decision makers, integrated rollback schedule execution, technical rollback task ownership, issuing of comms/marketing. •Rollback Comms: Key rollback messaging, business & customer groups to engage, channels for distributing rollback comms (e.g. website, Account/Relationship Managers, internal channels). •Interplay with policy contingency approach.What solution changes would need to be deployed as part of a rollback scenario in order to provide a minimum level of functionality to support any legislative requirements that were coupled to the production cutover window? •Back-up go-live window.If rollback was triggered, then when could the cutover be re-attempted? Must consider windows with minimal business/customer disruption, and enough separation from the initial cutover window to complete root causes analysis, remediate issues, and re-test / re-rehearse. “Major Release Deployment, High Level Rollback Block Diagram”. Similar to the cutover block diagram, this details the high level sequencing of tasks required to rollback the production changes deployed during a cutover. Also refer to the rollback section of the “BT Major Release Deployment, Deployment and Cutover Approach”. Contingency approach KEY QUESTION | What are the backup go-live dates if the baseline/target go-live date is no longer achievable OR rollback is triggered during an attempted cutover? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •What other suitable cutover windows exist? Identifying windows of lower customer/business activity and confirming if these contend with other IR programme delivery milestones (or if this contention can be removed). •Legislative dependencies & minimum solution requirements.Are there legislative changes associated with the release? If so, consideration should be given to: oContingency solution .In the event that the core solution does not pass final readiness assessments to deploy to production OR if rollback is required during the cutover window then what is the minimum viable contingency solution that would need to be deployed to ensure IR can meet all new legislative requirements? oIs the contingency solution a series of manual work-arounds, or would system changes be required? oMonitoring the need for contingency . If a contingency solution requires system changes then how will this additional build and test activity be built into the delivery schedule, what triggers the need to start build/test? n/a, this is typically detailed in the deployment strategy, however refer to: “Major Release Deployment, Go-live Contingency Planning” for a specific paper that was created for the final BT major release (S4.1.R2).

KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Identify impacted business units.Deployment impact may be consolidated to a relatively small cutover window, or could span more broadly across the deployment preparation phase. •Identify types of impact and business response required.Common deployment-related impacts on business operations may include: oCutover outages . One or more key systems or channels need to be down during business hours, resulting in: a work-around being required in order for impacted business units to continue to work (e.g. access to read- only systems), OR agreement on alternative work being completed during the cutover outage window (e.g. training in preparation for new system changes). oData migration . This may require longer-running business involvement in order to support data clean-up tasks necessary to support a clean and stable data migration process, or to prioritise and work-through back-logged work items that are in scope for conversion. Consideration should be given to: What specific items require ramp-down focus? Which business units are responsible for these items? Who will engage with these units and monitor progress? Other than the start of cutover, is there a drop-dead time for completing this data processing? If ramp-down doesn’t fully complete, then what manual data migration work is required, and by when would this need to be completed post-cutover? oShifting business events . Some events may coincide with the cutover outage window and need to be rescheduled to avoid customer impact and reputational damage to IR – e.g. Working for Families weekly payments. The relevant business unit(s) need to be engaged to agree the shift in time for such events, and rescheduling of necessary preparation/processing tasks to enable this. •Identify Transition requirements.Any cutover related outages may require the timing of other business event(s) to be adjusted to avoid this disruption. “Major Release Deployment, Business Deployment Traffic Light Diagram”. High level illustration of when key services and systems will be shutdown in preparation for cutover, and brought back online for go-live (NB: this is refined during the detail cutover planning phase). Early Life Support Approach •Business support– additional support to the business to ensure they’re able to get up to speed as quickly as possible with the new solution and continue to meet the needs of customers and service providers, who are also getting used to a new solution. Additional support in this area includes deskside support, additional service desk people to help with extra calls, urgent knowledge base articles. •Technical support - This is where additional people are added into the standard system support processes to provide solution specific knowledge and extra capacity to match the increase in support requirements. In general this support uses existing processes but with additional people who have the technical knowledge of the new solution. NB: Early Life Support was not a responsibility of BT Deployment Services •n/a, Early Life Support was not the responsibility of BT Deployment Services Deployment Planning Rehearsals & Preparation CutoverStabilisationDeployment Review DP1DP2DP3DP4 Deployment StrategyDeployment Design Detailed Deployment & Cutover Planning BT Deployment Framework Deployment Planning Phase | Key Questions & Considerations IN CONFIDENCE – EXTERNAL RELEASE Topic AreasKey Question & Areas for ConsiderationHuringa Artefact(s) Comms & Marketing approach KEY QUESTION | How and when will cutover updates be communicated to relevant stakeholder groups? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Target audiences.Which customers and stakeholders must be informed of the release and associated cutover? E.g. customers split by relevant segments (e.g. Tax professionals, Employers, businesses, individuals), internal business units, vendors, partnering agencies & organisations, general public). •Content of comms & marketing.Is there a subset of key messages that can be used to guide comms to external groups, and likewise for internal groups? Any specific impacts must also be captured and included in appropriate comms – e.g. shutdown of information shares with partnering agencies, shifting payment dates for WfF customers, unavailability of core systems for business processing, etc. •Timing of comms & marketing. When should comms material be distributed to impacted stakeholder groups, and how does this timing differ for internal groups and external groups? What triggers comms material to be issued – e.g. successful stage-gate assessment point, successful completion of a cutover rehearsal etc. If there are multiple releases of comms then how will detail of cutover increase? •Channels for distributing comms & marketing. Which channels will be used to distribute key messages, and how does this vary between: oInternal messaging – e.g. Snapshots, Intranet home page & service alert widget, People Leader briefs, email groups, Yammer. oExternal messaging – e.g. IR website, pre-recorded Contact Centre message, Front of House posters, customer correspondence (e.g. email and letters), social channels, IR Account Managers, Ministerial briefing notes, Commissioner/Executive email to key stakeholders. •Contingency comms & marketing. How will comms be managed through contingency scenarios – e.g. pre- prepared material for rollback, delayed go-live – either due to cutover being deferred, or cutover runs but needs more time to complete, so communicated go-live times need to be updated on relevant channels (e.g. IR website). •Content creation. Who is responsible for drafting comms & marketing content? •Approval. Who is responsible for approving comms & marketing material prior to distribution? NB:Comms and Marketing was not the responsibility of BT Deployment Services, however, the deployment team did interface with the Comms and Marketing team to ensure they understood key dates and customer/business impacts associated with each major release cutover. “Cutover Communications Strategy & Plan”identifies target audiences that must be engaged about the release and cutover, key messages to distribute, and timing of the distribution. NB:This deliverable was owned by the BT OCMT team. The BT Deployment team provided input with key dates and timings, however it was not the responsibility of this team.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Integrated cutover run-sheet.Captures at a high level all tasks that must be completed to ensure a successful cutover. There are four main categories of tasks: 1. Pre-cutover dependencies: Tasks that must be completed in the lead-in to the official cutover window (e.g. technical pre-deployments, business & technical ramp-down activities, internal & external comms, decision gate(s) for proceeding to production cutover). 2.Cutover tasks : All tasks required to deploy the solution and manage the cutover window. Covers business deployment tasks, technical cutover tasks, and support domains (e.g. comms). Each entry in the cutover run- sheet represents a unique task and should include: oA brief description of what the task is. oScheduled start-time, forecast duration, and scheduled stop time. oDependencies to any other cutover tasks (both upstream predecessors and downstream successors). oTask Owner who will be performing the task, and who their back-up person is. 3.Cutover milestones : All points within the cutover run-sheet that represent a stage-gate to proceed with the next set of tasks within the cutover run-sheet. Cutover milestones for BT major releases include: oSign-off of data reconciliation and converted data verification results. oSign-off of crown reconciliation results. oCompletion of BPIV. oGo/No-go decision point. 4.Cutover checkpoints / meetings : Pre-arranged meeting where the cutover team discuss current progress & issues, and whether any adjustments to the cutover schedule are required. •Cutover block diagram. Provides a simplified one-page view of the cutover run-sheet (i.e. key tasks, runtimes, and sequencing). This is a useful aid for cutover planning workshops when the integrated cutover run-sheet may be too detailed to facilitate productive conversation. •Critical path tolerances.By how many hours can the critical path slip before the cutover window (and associated system/channel outages) exceeds the designated cutover window. What is the drop-dead point in the cutover window to call a rollback decision and at what point in the cutover schedule must recovery points for data and/or code be established? NB: Topic area is continued on the following page. “Major Release Deployment, Integrated Cutover Runsheet”. Run- sheet that provides a high level view of all technical and business tasks required to execute the end-to-end cutover.

IN CONFIDENCE – EXTERNAL RELEASE Topic AreasKey Question & Areas for ConsiderationHuringa Artefact(s) Cutover run- sheets (continued from previous page) KEY QUESTION | How will the step-by-step detail for executing all cutover related tasks be logged and tracked? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Detailed workstream run-sheets.Captures at a detailed level the cutover tasks for a particular workstream and provides enough detail & instruction for the task owner to execute their task(s): oOwners . Who is responsible for each workstream run-sheet? Close working relationship is needed with these people to ensure detailed plans are correctly built and incorporated into the integrated cutover run-sheet. oDependencies . Are there any cross-workstream or cross-system dependencies? These are often areas of complexity and require detailed planning that involves all relevant workstreams. •Restricted User Access.During cutover does system/channel access need to be restricted to individuals/teams supporting cutover? “Major Release Deployment, Workstream Deployment Runsheet - CDC Example”.Detailed cutover run-sheets that detail at a granular level the technical implementation steps that are required to deploy change for a specific system. Designed to be used by the task doers implementing the technical change, with key events and milestones rolling up to the integrated cutover schedule.

IN CONFIDENCE – EXTERNAL RELEASE Topic AreasKey Question & Areas for ConsiderationHuringa Artefact(s) Building the integrated cutover run- sheet (continued on the following page) KEY QUESTION | What tasks, dependencies, and milestones need to be captured in the master integrated run- sheet? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Decision Gate.Meeting where go-live committee agrees that cutover can proceed. System/channel shut-down and distribution of cutover comms is dependent on this approval. The lead-time needed for these tasks should partly inform when this decision should be made – e.g. if multiple days are required to complete the ramp-down of a specific product(s) to support it’s migration, then timing of the cutover approval must factor this in. •Shutdown of systems, channels, and business activity.Consideration should be given to progressive channel/system shutdown to allow final transactions to pass to the back-end; monitoring of channels (e.g. B2B) to confirm receipt of final files/messages; shutdown of any external partner systems if they need to stop sending files; switching off monitoring & placing START servers to maintenance mode to avoid security alerts during cutover; applying relevant outage messages for customer channels; whitelisting access to relevant systems; disabling SMS & email alerts from START; publishing a START broadcast message; issuing comms to impacted agencies and partner organisations once shutdown has been completed and reminding them of any upcoming cutover related obligations. •Batch processing. Consideration should be given to the scope of final system batch processing – including any out of cycle job runs and disabling of irrelevant jobs that can be delayed until after the cutover; interfaces (internally between IR systems, or external to IR needed to stay online to support final batch processing. •Technical system(s) upgrade. Consideration should be given to pre-upgrade back-ups of code/config & data to ensure a reliable rollback point; disabling of automated START back-ups through the cutover; which systems/channels are in scope for upgrade and any dependencies between them? •Data migration. How to source data extracts (e.g. are firewall changes required to enable transfer from the conversion environment to production?); what is required to ensure data extracts are fully up to date before taking them; independent balance reports to support reconciliation; verification checks by business SMEs. •Post conversion data processing. What processing can be completed via batch-job as opposed to run manually by developers or SMEs? Any manual ‘house keeping’ tasks may require system access. •Business Verification (BPIV). Verifying that key business scenarios are functioning as intended. Consideration should be given to whether any BAU files must be retained or generated to support core business processes required for verifying relevant business scenarios. Systems and channels will need to be brought online to enable business scenarios to be run – how will access be restricted to only those performing the BPIV scenarios. oCore Systems : START security controls omyIR : Maintenance Mode oContact Centre : n/a, technical components to be enabled for small windows of time.

Access can be to more than one system, and access to different systems is administered by different technical SMEs. “Major Release Deployment, Shutdown and Start-up Approach for IR Partnering Organisations”. This should be used to determine which partnering agencies have file/message exchanges that are impacted by cutover outages to core systems or channels. From there, out of cycle exchanges prior to and following cutover may need to be arranged to minimise the disruption to these exchanges and any subsequent processing.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Go / No-go decision. What milestones/inputs are required to inform this decision? •Start-up. What cutover processing must complete prior to start-up & what can run in parallel to start-up; what must be up and operational before the first nightly batch stream commences; what engagement with externals is required to support channel start-up (e.g. confirming messages); how must system and channel start-up be sequenced to avoid unintended start-up errors; verifying successful start-up of relevant interfaces (i.e. those that were paused, shut, or changed through cutover); processing of any backlogged transactions held either by IR or external agencies through cutover, re-enabling automated DB back-ups and removing servers from maintenance mode? n/a – refer previous page.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Pre-cutover environment smoke-testing: oWhat technical changes can be verified ahead of time (e.g. connectivity tests for external end-points, confirmation of storage requirements, certificate renewals)? •Technical Post-Implementation Verification (TPIV): oFor each system with technical changes, what checks can be performed during the cutover window to verify that the technical deployment of those changes were successful? •Business Post-Implementation Verification (BPIV): oEnsure scope is reviewed with a holistic approach across both functional areas and systems to ensure sufficient coverage is achieved with minimal scenarios, e.g. what key regression checks should be verified, what scenarios / business processes are in scope for change and definitely need to be verified before go-live? oAnalyse both Business and Customer impacts of each proposed scenario to ensure the BPIV scope will avoid any ‘showstoppers’ on day-one.BPIV scenarios should be focussed on those that are business critical for day 1 of go-live, other less critical scenarios should be tracked as ProdQA tasks following go-live. oIdentify business resources to execute BPIV scenarios, and technical resources to support issue resolution. Both groups will require access to relevant systems during the BPIV window of cutover. “Major Release Deployment, BPIV Approach”.Details the verification steps pre/during/post cutover and how these were run for BT major release cutovers.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Cyclic business events.Which business events (and associated back-end system processing) may be impacted by the cutover outage and require a change in schedule? Consideration should be given to: oProducts in scope for migration that must be ramped down . How much time is required for in-flight work items to be processed through to completion? Across this ramp-down period, how will system and business-user processing progressively ramp-down to position the system and data at a quiet point for data extraction? For example: Manual business tasks. E.g. scanning or refund/payment processing that must be complete by a certain time prior to cutover commencing to ensure they are fully processed before cutover outages are enforced. System processing. E.g. daily / weekly / monthly jobs that either must not be run any later than a given time to avoid WIP build-up OR must be run out-of-cycle before cutover begins to clear WIP items. o Other products conflicting with the cutover window that must be re-scheduled. Are there key events with customer-impacting implications if they are not re-scheduled clear of the cutover outage window? E.g. payments for social policy products – Working for Families, Child Support etc. •Key business stakeholders.Who are the relevant business teams needed to; a) provide input the each transition approach, b) required to support the actual execution of these approaches, and c) provide endorsement from a business perspective? How will these groups be involved through the rehearsals, and how their tasks will be tracked in the lead-up to cutover? •Comms.Do the product transition approaches cause additional business and/or customer impact by changing event dates? If so, what comms are required: oExternally to impacted customer groups oInternally to impacted business units “Major Release Deployment, Product Transition Approaches”. These plans detail how the administration of specific products will: •Ramp down to a quiet point prior to cutover (if they need to be brought to a quiet point to support migration to a new system) •Operationalised following go-live e.g. when the ‘firsts’ of key processing jobs run. •Have key business or customer events rescheduled to avoid conflicting with system and channel outages for cutover (e.g. processing & issuing customer disbursements). Deployment Planning Rehearsals & Preparation CutoverStabilisationDeployment Review DP1DP2DP3DP4 Deployment StrategyDeployment Design Detailed Deployment & Cutover Planning BT Deployment Framework Deployment Planning Phase | Key Questions & Considerations IN CONFIDENCE – EXTERNAL RELEASE Topic AreasKey Question & Areas for ConsiderationHuringa Artefact(s) Detailed Rollback planning KEY QUESTION | If go-live criteria are not met during cutover and rollback is required then what is the sequence of technical rollback tasks, system co-ex processing / catch-up processing, and verification checks that are needed to fully rollback systems and data to a pre-cutover state? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •High priority rollback scope.What rollback tasks must be completed before core systems/channels re-open: oTechnical rollback . Code/config rollback for each system that has had technical changes deployed during the cutover window. Data rollback for any datasets that have had data updates applied during the cutover window. oBusiness tasks . Information redacted. oSupport tasks . E.g. issuing rollback comms to internal and external stakeholder groups. •Lower priority rollback scope.Are there any technical/business rollback items that don’t need to be completed before core system/channel re-opening? If so, these should be deferred to simplify the immediate rollback focus to those business critical systems and datasets. •Post rollback catch-up processing / re-processing. Was any processing held through the cutover window that must either be; a) re-processed in a different way due to rollback, or b) be processed as a priority to enable upcoming business events to run correctly? The product transition plans often result in items being held in the days/week leading into cutover, these held items often needs to be processed as a priority following system/channel start-up. •Establishing rollback points in the cutover / roll-forward schedule. Which systems require back-ups to enable rollback vs. systems that will be manually rolled back. Any required back-ups must be scheduled into the cutover schedule, with consideration given to: oOwnership . Who is responsible for this back-up activity? Many outsourced services will require the respective vendor to take the back-up. oEstablishing logical data recovery points . If data back-ups are required across multiple systems, is there a need to ensure data is synced between these systems (i.e. no in-flight transactions) prior to taking back-ups? •Minimum rollback window. How much time is required to complete rollback of the high priority scope and complete system/channel start-up? This should inform the drop-dead point in the cutover schedule for making a rollback decision – if rollback begins beyond this then then system/channel start-up will be delayed beyond the communicated start-up time. •Rollback checkpoints. Is there a need to assess rollback at multiple points through the cutover schedule, or is a single decision expected at the drop-dead time? If multiple checkpoints are required then how does the rollback schedule grow and evolve between these checkpoints? •Rollback verification.How will rollback be proven successful? Consideration should be given to: oTechnical rollback PIV . TPIV checks required at a system-level as part of any technical deployment. oBusiness verification scenarios . Business scenarios that are critical to day-1 operations – similar to BPIV but testing end-to-end business processes with the rolled back solution. “Major Release Deployment, Integrated Rollback Runsheet”. Schedule containing all business and technical steps required to rollback an attempted cutover that failed to meet go-live criteria. Deployment Planning Rehearsals & Preparation CutoverStabilisationDeployment Review DP1DP2DP3DP4 Deployment StrategyDeployment Design Detailed Deployment & Cutover Planning BT Deployment Framework Deployment Planning Phase | Key Questions & Considerations IN CONFIDENCE – EXTERNAL RELEASE Topic AreasKey Question & Areas for ConsiderationHuringa Artefact(s) Logistics Planning KEY QUESTION | What arrangements are needed to support any irregular working hours that that are required through the cutover window? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Arrangements for after-hours work.If cutover runs outside of standard business hours, must consider: oAccommodation requirements . If Hotel rooms are required for out-of-town individuals to support cutover (e.g. cutover run on-site at Wellington Asteron Centre), or are working irregular / night time hours and need to remain close to the cutover site for quick response to any high priority cutover issues as they emerge. Rydges hotel has been used for previous BT major release cutover. oTransport requirements . People working after-hours may need transport arrangements to get home at the end of their shift, this is usually supported one of two ways: Pre-paid taxi card, Arranging car park access across L2 and L3 of the Asteron building. oHealth and Safety . Ensuring a Fire Warden and First Aid rep are on-sight throughout the cutover period and where one or more individuals are on-sight for cutover purposes (i.e. there may be some quiet after-hours where cutover tasks are either being performed remotely or cutover has stood down for the night. Fire Warden and First Aid training should be arranged if additional coverage is required. o After-hours Security. Using a buddy system for after-hours taxi pick-ups and travelling to the hotel – i.e. no one should have to go outside on their own. •Arrangements for office-based cutover:If cutover is to be run/hosted from IR office space, must consider: oCentral Control Centre . Where will this be based, do any room bookings need to be made? oShared spaces / cutover hubs . Is a shared space required for complex tasks that require a lot of individuals and desk space / work stations (e.g. BPIV, data verification)? •Arrangements for remote cutover:If cutover is to be run remotely then ensure all necessary arrangements are in place to keep the team connected through the cutover period, and that everyone is equipped with their necessary remote working permissions. Consideration should be given to: oCutover Control . Providing a virtual replacement to the Cutover Control room (e.g. Microsoft Teams group) where cutover progress updates and issues are published and accessible to anyone involved in cutover. oVirtual collaboration groups . Ensuring any complex tasks that require interaction between different groups have an online collaboration space to do so (e.g. dedicated Microsoft Teams group). This is often required to so people can share screens and talk through any issues in real time. oSystem remote access . Ensuring that technical teams have remote access to the systems/tools/environments required for them to perform their technical implementation tasks. All remote access requirements should be confirmed prior to the cutover window, however on-call support from the IR Service Desk should also be arranged to ensure any remote access issues encountered during cutover can be resolved under urgency. oCalendar invites . Any cutover meetings must be accompanied with a dial-in option. oVendor access . Vendors involved in cutover must able to access IR’s remote working tools from their own network. “Major Release Deployment, Cutover People Roster”. Master list of each individual required to support one or more cutover task. Includes details of accommodation and/or taxi requirements per individual. “Major Release Deployment, Cutover Information Pack”.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Identifying who is required to support cutover.People are most likely required for cutover to; (a) provide technical implementation skills to deploy the new solution, (b) are from the business and required to complete ramp-down processing in the lead-in to cutover, (c) are a system expert and need to be available to provide on-call support, (d) are part of the release leadership team and need to be available for issue escalation and go-live approval. Key resource groups to consider include: oProject/Programme members . Those involved in the design/build/test of the solution and are required to implement and/or verify the solution. oSystem SMEs . May be required to support system/channel shutdown, as well as deploying change relevant to their system. oRelevant Business Units . Required to support ramp-down of transaction processing in the lead-in to cutover, and will need to be engaged to support any post go-live manual processing / catch-up processing / or work- arounds due to unexpected cutover issues. oIT Service Management Support Groups . BAU support required to facilitate unplanned/emergency change, major incidents, desktop support issues (e.g. Service Management Tower – Change, MIM, Service Desk). oVendors . Key vendors are often required to perform technical cutover tasks, to monitor the infrastructure/ platform/ service that they provide to IR, and provide on-call support for triage and resolution of technical issues. oRelease Management . To support the triage and management of high severity issues that may risk rollback or impact cutover critical path duration. oExternal agencies / organisations . Needed to support the channel shutdown process (e.g. sending and receiving of B2B messages or files during shutdown and start-up). May also be required to deploy equivalent technical changes to their systems if required as part of the solution. o Governance/ Go-Live Committee. Group responsible to approve major decisions relating to cutover (e.g. go-live and rollback decisions). •Confirming when people are required through the cutover window. Should have people roster that details hour-by-hour who is required to support cutover. This register should also detail: oWhere each person will be (e.g. on-site vs remote) oWhether they’re required for a specific task, or in an on-call support role oContact details (e.g. phone, email, desk location) oAn appropriate back-up person should they become unavailable for unforeseen circumstances The Cutover roster should then be used to drive some of the logistics planning detailed on the previous slide (e.g. accommodation requirements, transport requirements, who has Fire Warden / First Aid training). “Major Release Deployment, Cutover People Roster”.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Comms issued pre-cutover oKey changes/enhancements associated with the release oGeneral timing of cutover – i.e. timing of the shutdown, cutover, and start-up periods oPer stakeholder group, any impacts that are specific to them (e.g. ramp-down of a product for data migration may require an external information share to be shutdown prior to the advertised outage period) oWho to contact / where to look (e.g. IR website) for further information. •Comms issues post go-live. Have pre-drafted comms with key go-live messages ready to distribute for different scenarios/outcomes from the cutover window. o Go-live was successful and ran to plan. o Go-live successful, but with known issues. The impact of these issues should be communicated to impacted stakeholder groups – i.e. what this means for them, and whether any adjustments are required on their end. o Go-live successful, but delayed. Meaning that system/channel start-up begin at a later time that was communicated. This often requires pre-drafted, pre-approved comms ready to publish to key channels (e.g. IR website banner and service outage page, myIR outage splash page) to ensure these service outage details contain the updated start-up time. o Go-live unsuccessful and rollback required. Messaging should be kept simple (i.e. no need to detail reasons why rollback was actioned). Further detailed comms would be required once a new cutover window is identified, however further analysis and decision making would be required before these comms were ready to draft and distribute. •Approval process. Who is required to review and approve comms material prior to distribution? The deployment team typically provides input and early review given they understand the nuances of the cutover shutdown process, however formal approval is typically required at the Manager/Sponsor/Executive lead. •Timing for distributing comms. As comms are drafted the target release date and channel should also be agreed. Detailed Cutover Comms (Internal) and Marketing (external) plans.Cutover- related comms to distribute to relevant stakeholder groups both in the lead-up to, during cutover, and following go-live.

Deployment Planning Rehearsals & Preparation CutoverStabilisationDeployment Review DP1DP2DP3DP4 Deployment StrategyDeployment Design Detailed Deployment & Cutover Planning BT Deployment Framework Deployment Planning Phase | Key Questions & Considerations IN CONFIDENCE – EXTERNAL RELEASE Topic AreasKey Question & Areas for Consideration Planning for Cutover Rehearsals KEY QUESTION | How can cutover rehearsals be planned to ensure they simulate production cutover conditions as closely as possible? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Planning for production-like rehearsals.Cutover rehearsals should be planned to be as like-for -like with the production cutover as possible. Give consideration to: oPeople . Anyone required for production cutover (i.e. cutover task owners, support roles, management) should be practising their role during the rehearsal(s). If more than one rehearsal is planned then consider giving the back-up resources an opportunity to practice their task(s). oGovernance . The go-live decision making process should be rehearsed with the go-live committee members. o Non-production environments. Rehearsal of technical cutover tasks should occur in the ‘n-1’ non-production environment – i.e. one environment removed from production. Special consideration should be given to: Performance considerations .The ‘n-1’ non-production environment should ideally have a similar performance level to production in order to give an accurate indication of runtimes. If there is a difference in environment specifications then there needs to be a reliable method for calculating production runtimes based cutover performance in the ‘n-1’ non-production environment. Availability .Environments must be booked for cutover rehearsals, and should not be shared with other groups (like testing) for the duration of the rehearsal. This is necessary to preserve the integrity of data in these environments. oCutover Management Practices . The processes and enabling tools for these should be ready to make use of during the rehearsals and includes: Task initiation, issue management, and communicating cutover updates. Single point of contact for Cutover Control team (e.g. shared Email Inbox, control room). Establishing communication channels and distribution lists for issuing progress updates throughout the rehearsal. Integrated run-sheet with updated details that reflect the rehearsal conditions. oPurpose . The purpose of a rehearsal is to prove that cutover tasks and processes will run successfully in the production environment within the allocated window. What outcomes must be achieved during the rehearsal to realise this? E.g. Successfully meeting go-live criteria. oHours of Operation. Will the rehearsal run 24/7, extended business hours, business hours? •Constraints and work-arounds.If specific cutover tasks can’t be performed – e.g. due to a technical constraint associated with the ‘n-1’ non- production environment – then what can be done to realistically simulate them as best possible? For example: o Paper-based cutover tasks.If a cutover activity can’t be performed as an actual task (e.g. shutdown/start-up) then paper-based walk- throughs should be arranged in which the cutover task, the respective up/down-stream dependencies, and run times are reviewed bythe relevant people. oPeople availability . If people aren’t available during the rehearsal window then make use of their back-up. This then becomes a training opportunity for the back-up people. oRequired Provisions . Some cutover tasks may not be ready to be fully/accurately completed at the time of rehearsal. If so, how might this compromise the intended outcomes of the rehearsal and what arrangements / work-arounds can be made? Deployment Planning Rehearsals & Preparation CutoverStabilisationDeployment Review DP1DP2DP3DP4 BT Deployment Framework Rehearsal(s) & Preparation Phase | Key Questions & Considerations Rehearsal & Preparation Phase |The purpose of the rehearsal phase is to validate the deployment and cutover plan by completing one or more practice runs of the cutover schedule. Refinements and lessons learned will be made to the cutover approach, master schedule, and cutovermanagement practices as a result of rehearsals. The outputs from this phase inform the official governance approval to proceed with the production cutover event.

Refer to the Cutover section of the Framework for details of these artefacts. IN CONFIDENCE – EXTERNAL RELEASE Topic AreasKey Question & Areas for Consideration Tracking readiness for rehearsal KEY QUESTION | What tasks must be completed to prepare the cutover team & technical environments to proceed with the rehearsal? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Monitor rehearsal readiness tasks.What must be completed before the rehearsal begins? oPeople . Everyone performing cutover tasks are booked for their respective cutover task windows, and anyone providing a broader support role knows when they must be available. All relevant people have been involved in run-sheet walk-throughs and understand what is required of them. o Cutover run-sheets.Completed to the necessary level of detail to enable the cutover tasks to be accurately performed by the person performing the task. Summary / high-level tasks have been accurately captured in the integrated cutover run-sheet. oChange management . Change approval obtained from the Enterprise Change Approval Board (non-production CAB for cutover rehearsals). oVendor Service Requests . Request for vendor support have been raised (typically as non-standard service requests in SNOW) and confirmed. Vendors have been engaged through the run-sheet design and walk-throughs and are familiar with the cutover processes that will be used. oLogistics . If 24/7 cutover; food/dinner plans, accommodation plans, transport/taxi arrangements, after-hours building access, after-hours health & safety wardens secured. oEnvironment readiness . Data refreshes complete for relevant non-production environments. oAccess . Cutover task doers have confirmed they’re able to access the necessary systems/servers/tools required to complete their tasks. oCutover Comms . Draft versions are ready to distribute to Cutover Control Team and be reviewed as part of the rehearsal. o Pre-deployment dependencies.Testing has completed in lower environments and is ready to be promoted OR testing cycle has completed and the environment can be reset and redeployed to (e.g. when there are multiple cycles of deployment and testing activities in the same environment). •Ownership.Who owns each readiness task, and by when is it due? •Tracking progress updates: How frequently will readiness be tracked, and when (e.g. weekly integrated forum, daily readiness stand-up, etc.). Perform cutover rehearsal(s) KEY QUESTION | How to run the cutover rehearsal as production-like as possible? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Executing the cutover run-sheet. Refer to ‘Cutover’ ‘Perform Technical Cutover’ for details. •Maintaining production-like standards. Specific consideration should be given to cutover management practices and whether these are being adhered to as they would during production cutover, including: oIssue management and escalation thresholds . What sorts of issues will require senior-level involvement to support triage and decision making? oManaging schedule updates . If delays in task completion cause downstream impacts, who needs to be informed, what tasks should be rescheduled, what is overall impact to the schedule and consideration should be given to the rollback points? oTask initiation and people availability . Ensuring that cutover rehearsal is the highest priority for all involved in cutover, and that they aren’t getting distracted by other work (e.g. BAU responsibilities, unrelated meetings etc.). oLogging observations & results . Keep record of issues, delays, observations through the cutover rehearsal. These should be used to drive lessons learned and improvements for subsequent rehearsals / production cutover.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Source feedback.Lessons learnt sessions with all key workstreams to identify areas of improvement for either the next rehearsal or deployment to production. Key topics to explore include: oWhat went well and we should continue doing? oWhat didn’t go well and either needs to be stopped or improved, or substituted by something new? Specifically this should focus on cutover issues and how these can be prevented in subsequent rehearsals / the production cutover. oRun-sheet: Were runtimes and task dependencies accurate? oCutover verification: Review scope after each rehearsal and amend as required. •Apply corrections to cutover approach and plan.Feedback and lessons learned must result in material changes to the cutover approach and run-sheet. This may require further cutover design workshops to revisit and refine certain parts of the cutover schedule. •Review impacts.Are there material changes to the cutover schedule that will influence; (a) expected runtimes and associated system/channel outages, or (b) the content of any comms material that already been published to internal or external groups, or has been drafted and ready to publish? Rehearse rollback KEY QUESTION | Is there a need to rehearse and validate the rollback schedule prior to the production cutover? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Scope of rehearsal.What elements of the rollback schedule could or should be rehearsed? Consideration should be given to: oElements of rollback that have not been tested prior, or not tested/actioned in recent history, and therefore are higher riskof failing. oElements of rollback that are complex – e.g. technical dependencies between the rollback of two separate systems. oThe end-to-end rollback scope – if necessary to prove that it can complete within a specific window (i.e. the minimum rollback window) oConsideration should be given to each of the main components of the BT rollback pattern: Technical rollback of system code/config changes and database restores. Rollback verification – i.e. regression testing business critical scenarios to validate correct pre-cutover functionality. Catch-up data processing – any data processing that would need to complete as a priority under rollback to allow key BAU events to run to schedule. •Outcomes.What are the expected outcomes of the rehearsal – e.g. prove a technical rollback process, prove runtime, prove that rollback schedule is correctly integrated with proper dependencies? •Limitations. How might rollback testing constrain the scope of testing and outcomes that can be proven? Consideration should be given to: oIf people and/or environment bookings limit the window for rollback testing, what components of rollback should be tested as a priority? oDo the non-production environments have the correct cross-system integration to enable a full rollback test? oWill other release activities (e.g. testing) limit the time available to test rollback? •People.Who is required to support rollback, and do these people at all differ from the roll-forward / cutover roster?

KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Have rehearsals proven production cutover is well positioned to succeed?Has the cutover rehearsal process proven the following: oThe integrated schedule is accurate & complete . All cutover tasks required to deploy the new solution have been identified and successfully rehearsed – including verifying any dependencies between tasks. oCutover runtime and associated system/channel outages confirmed . Is this consistent with the previously approved cutover outage window? oCutover exit criteria successfully met during rehearsals . E.g. sign-off of data conversion & crown reconciliation results, business critical BPIV scenarios successfully validated, cutover runtime & associated outages confirmed as completing within the approved window? oIf cutover rehearsals have not met these criteria then additional supplementary rehearsals may need to be scheduled to prove allnecessary outcomes prior to receiving approval to proceed with production cutover. On-going business integration KEY QUESTION | Are relevant business stakeholders receiving the necessary updates on deployment progress in order to manage their own set of cutover readiness tasks, and are they being engaged in a timely manner where business input is needed to inform a change in cutover approach? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Transition approach updates.How have product transitions changed as a result of cutover rehearsals? Who from business must be consulted to agree on proposed changes? •Cutover updates.How has cutover schedule changed as a result of the cutover rehearsal(s), what is material impact of this to business? •On-going updates and communication.Who from the business must the deployment team regularly engage with to share progress updates, monitor business readiness (e.g. progress with burndown tasks), and work through issues as they arise? What frequency of updatesmakes sense, and what’s the best way to engage? Release deployment forum KEY QUESTION | Is an integration forum necessary to regularly engage the different groups involved in the cutover planning & implementation? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Audience.Who to involve (e.g. workstream deployment leads / workstream leads / key vendors / business representatives). •Frequency.How often does it makes sense to run the integration forum? Typically weekly, with more frequent checkpoints as go-live nears? •Agenda.Is there a standard list of topics to cover – e.g. risks and issues, readiness tracking, cutover walk-throughs, roundtable updates? Support Enterprise Change Management KEY QUESTION | How might other change / other releases introduce unintended environment contention with your changes? Is there a need to support Enterprise Change and Release team impact assess other proposed changes? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Change Boards.Providing coverage across both non-production and production change approval boards. •Change Control.Is there need for a change freeze or heightened change awareness period in order to maintain environment stability in the lead-up to deployment? oHow many days/weeks out should this be enforced prior to and following cutover? oAre there exemptions to this period? E.g. security patching, emergency change, P1/P2 incident fixes?

If so, does it make sense to do so (i.e. to remove complexity and risk from cutover) and who will be responsible for each pre-deployment? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Pre-deployment impact confirmed as minimal.Can the solution be pre-deployed in a dormant state, only to be activated during the production cutover window? The dormant solution must not impact on current state business processes or technical services. •Pre-deployment window. When does it makes sense to deploy the change, and is an outage required to deploy the change? If so cutover may need to be deferred to outside of business hours – e.g. overnight or during a weekend period. If an outage is required, what services will be impacted, who will be impacted, and what level of comms and stakeholder engagement will be necessary to communicate the impact? •Solution readiness confirmed.Testing has been completed and test-exit approved? •Deployment readiness confirmed.Deployment resources confirmed (incl. vendors if needed), cutover validated through rehearsal / deployment to QUAL, environment smoke testing complete etc. A readiness checklist similar to that used for the main production cutover window can be used to track, confirm, and report on readiness. •Change Management. Change request raised and approved by the Change Approval Board. Execute comms & marketing plan KEY QUESTION | Are we on track to distribute comms to the agreed timings/milestones established in the cutover comms plan? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Changes in cutover approach as a result of cutover rehearsals. Is there a need to review and amend any pre-drafted cutover comms material based on changes to the cutover approach that have resulted from cutover rehearsal lessons learnt? E.g. Changes to the shutdown/ start-up times, additional business ramp-down/deployment tasks identified. Who is needed to support these reviews and updates: oDeployment team . Reviewing any pre-drafted comms material to confirm existing content is still accurate, or identifying areas that require updating based on changes to the cutover approach. oComms & marketing . Applying relevant updates to any pre-drafted comms material, creating any new comms material as identified by the deployment team, maintaining the master source of comms material and owning any further executive review and approval processes prior to distribution. oConsistency of language . Ensuring internal comms and external marketing groups are integrated and using consistent dates, times, and messaging. •Distribution of cutover comms. Ensure we remain on track to distribute cutover comms to the agreed timings / release milestones. Consideration should be given to: oSequencing . Comms are typically distributed to internal audiences first, and followed by external groups. oMeans of distribution . Who from IR must be engaged to support the distribution of comms – e.g. Account Management Team for communicating with partnering agencies/organisations, CTO for key vendors, Commissioner for Ministerial briefing(s) and engagingwith other public agency CEs etc. Deployment Planning Rehearsals & Preparation CutoverStabilisationDeployment Review DP1DP2DP3DP4 BT Deployment Framework Rehearsal(s) & Preparation Phase | Key Questions & Considerations Cutover Rehearsal(s) On-going business integration Release deployment forum Support Enterprise Change Management Solution pre- deployment(s) Comms & marketing Topic AreasKey Question & Areas for ConsiderationHuringa Artefact(s) Track final cutover readiness (continued on the following page) KEY QUESTION |Have all final preparation and readiness tasks being completed ahead of the production cutover window?

Each person has been engaged through the cutover rehearsal(s) and so understands the cutover practices and expectations. •On-site requirements accurately logged.If cutover is to be run on-site as opposed to remotely then there is a on-sight hours for each individual are accurately logged in the cutover roster. 2. CUTOVER SCHEDULES •Detailed technical run-sheets finalised: oAll tasks and their respective runtimes and dependencies are captured in the integrated cutover run-sheet. oWalk-throughs for detailed technical run-sheets have been completed with relevant technical experts and cutover task doers, these details are accurately captured in the integrated run-sheet. •Rollback run-sheet finalised.Detailed rollback tasks are included in each workstream run-sheet. These have been reviewed through detailed walk-throughs and are accurately captured in the integrated run-sheet. 3. CHANGE AND RELEASE MANAGEMENT •Production CAB approval.All production change requests have been raised and approved by the Production Change Approval Board (CAB). •Change controls.Enterprise Change and Release have been engaged to support cutover though: oEnforcing change freeze . All unrelated changes are on hold during the cutover window, with change freeze potentially extending days/weeks either side of cutover to ensure environment stability. oSupporting unplanned change . The process, roles, and responsibilities are confirmed for deploying unplanned changes (necessary to support cutover) during the production cutover window. •Vendor Service Requests.Vendor support for cutover has been raised and accepted through standard IR channels. Work has been budgeted for and POs are in place to enable payment. 4. ENVIRONMENT CHECKS •Smoke testing.Any pre-cutover smoke testing has been completed and validated (e.g. database storage checks, telnet connectivity tests, certificate renewals). •Access controls.Cutover user access controls to relevant systems have been confirmed.

IN CONFIDENCE – EXTERNAL RELEASE Topic AreasKey Question & Areas for ConsiderationHuringa Artefact(s) Track final cutover readiness (continued from previous slide) 5. LOGISTICS (readiness tasks are largely dependent on whether cutover is run on-site or remotely): •After-hours arrangements confirmed.Accommodation and transport requirements have been arranged. •Health and Safety arrangements.There is Fire Warden and First Aid coverage throughout the cutover window. •Cutover location.Location confirmed – including floor/room/desk space bookings and after-hours building access. •Calendar bookings.Cutover milestones/checkpoints and updates have been booked in relevant calendars. •Cutover update comms & distribution lists. Comms distribution lists have been carried forward from the cutover rehearsals, other people know how to access request to cutover comms. 6. COMMS & MARKETING •Go-live comms drafted, approved, ready to issue through the cutover window.Pre-drafted comms are ready to distribute through the cutover window and cover multiple scenarios: oWe go-live as planned oWe go-live but with a delayed start-up oWe failed to go-live and had to rollback to current state systems and business processes. •Business deployment snapshots.Drafted and ready to issue as per business deployment plan. •Pre-cutover comms distributed and/or ready to publish.Any relevant marketing material has been posted (e.g. heads-ups notification banners and service update page on IR website, myIR carousel, myIR splash page drafted and ready to publish at the time of cutover shutdown, front of house posters are ready to display if business shutdown is required). 7. BUSINESS READINESS FOR CUTOVER •Burndown work has been completed, or is on-track to complete before cutover begins. Where an issue has occurred an agreed work-around has been developed that involved both business and technical cutover teams. •Business users required for cutover understand what they will be doing and when, they also know who to report to during the cutover window. •Business units understand their focus/priority areas following go-live – e.g. supporting manual catch-up processing from cutover, preparing for next business event, etc. •Business integration points have been identified and will be updated through the cutover window. •Business units understand what work can progress through the cutover window and are equipped to do so. 8. OUTSTANDING ACTIONS FROM CUTOVER REHEARSALS Was there anything that needed to be re-tested / re-validated due to issues encountered during the cutover rehearsals? n/a, refer to previous page.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Executing the Cutover run-sheet: o Ramp-down. Have ramp-down tasks been completed as expected, or were there unforeseen errors that require a work-around to be implemented pre/during/post-cutover? Will this impact data conversion? oSystem/Channel shutdown . Have all pre-shutdown checks completed as planned? (e.g. final files / messages / transactions processed to back- end systems)? Have simple access checks been run to validate key systems and channels have been properly disabled? Once shutdown completes, has this been communicated to relevant technical contacts of impacted organisations? oOvernight batch. Have required integrations remained online to support batch processing? If unexpected errors arise, can they be fixed during the batch window or must they be deferred to a later point in cutover or following go-live? If errors result, is there a need for annual business intervention following go-live? oUpgrade stream . Have all pre-dependent tasks been completed prior to running the upgrade? Have TPIV checks confirmed that the technical upgrade/deployment ran as expected without unintended issues? oConversion . Have final heritage/legacy data updates been tracked to completion prior to beginning the data extract process? Have all required independent balance reports been run and passed to the conversion team to support their reconciliation process? o Post-conversion processing. Are there any critical jobs that must run to completion before allowing users in the system? oBPIV . Have all identified scenarios successfully been completed without issues? Where open issues, does a resolution plan exist and business work-around scenarios been agreed with business owners? oGovernance . Have all go-live exit criteria been met? If not, is there confidence that issues can be resolved in time to complete cutover within the approved window? Is there a need to request more time to complete cutover and what’s the business and customer impact of this? Is there a need to seek approval for rollback? o System/Channel start-up. Has each system/channel/interface been confirmed as working correctly – including connectivity testing with relevant partner agencies and organisations? (NB: relevant agencies/organisations are typically those that have deployed system/channel changes during the cutover too, if no external change then typically no need to liaise directly with external partners and can instead monitor network traffic). oTransition to ELS .What cutover issues remain open? What’s the impact to business ops or customer experience, and what’s the timeline to resolve (e.g. by when must a resolution be in place to prevent an escalating issue)? •Track Critical Path oAre tasks on the critical path running ahead of schedule? Can downstream tasks be brought forward and start earlier than planned – and are the right people available to support this? oAre tasks on the critical path running behind schedule? What are the downstream impacts to the cutover schedule and key milestones? Can cutover still be completed within the approved window? Do people with downstream tasks need contacting to inform them their planned start will be delayed? “Major Release Deployment, Cutover Go- live Decision Paper”.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Who needs engaging to support the triage and resolution of each cutover issue? •For high risk areas, is there 24/7 resource coverage to support issue triage? •What’s the issue severity and cutover impact – e.g. exit criteria at risk, delay to schedule, business-critical functionality is not correct? This should inform urgency to resolve and whether escalation is required or not. •Is there a fix or work-around ready to apply? •Is there any residual issue for go-live (e.g. temporarily out-dated or quarantined data, an approved manual business work-around required etc.), if so what must be communicated to the business and potentially customers? •Is an unplanned change required in order to resolve the issue? If so, who must be involved to support the change? “Major Release Deployment, Cutover Issue Register”. Spreadsheet detailing each issue reported to cutover control during cutover. Also includes detail on root cause analysis and resolution. Cutover Control Comms & Progress Updates KEY QUESTION | Is the cutover comms plan being adhered to, and is there a need for any out-of-cycle comms? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: Communicating Updates: •Is there a standard message format for each type of comms? E.g. tasks completed since last update, update on open issues, whether we’re tracking ahead or behind of schedule. •Is there a need for an out-of-cycle update to communicate a major milestone accomplishment or major issue? Initiating & Tracking Cutover Tasks: •Cutover tasks are typically initiated via email from Cutover Control to the task doer. If multiple tasks must be kicked-off at the same time then task initiation emails should be pre-drafted so they’re ready to be quickly send at the appropriate time. •How will people be reminded of upcoming cutover task responsibilities? E.g. issuing reminder email x-hrs prior to beginning, and asking for email confirmation. •Are there delays in schedule that need to be communicated to task owners with upcoming cutover tasks? This could be via email or phone call depending on the urgency. “Major Release Deployment, Cutover Comms Examples”which provides worked examples of the different types of comms and comms channels that are used by the BT Deployment team during a major release cutover. Manage people and logistics KEY QUESTION | What adjustments, if any, are required to the cutover people plan? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Are adjustments to transport, accommodation, or after-hours working arrangements needed? A dedicated co- ordinator should be nominated to handle the associated planning. •If there has been changes in timing of the cutover schedule then are there any calendar invites that must be updated with accurate times? •Do back-up resources need to be called in due to unplanned / unexpected absences? n/a Deployment Planning Rehearsals & Preparation CutoverStabilisationDeployment Review DP1DP2DP3DP4 Track final cutover readiness items Perform technical cutoverBusiness transition processesComms & marketing BT Deployment Framework Cutover Phase | Key Questions & Considerations IN CONFIDENCE – EXTERNAL RELEASE Topic AreasKey Question & Areas for ConsiderationHuringa Artefact(s) Ramp-down processing KEY QUESTION | Was the business ramp-down plan able to run as expected, have issues/delays resulted that now require work-arounds to be agreed and planned for? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Milestone tracking and business integration.Are business ramp-down tasks being tracked through the integrated cutover run-sheet? What’s the line of communication between the cutover control team and the business unit(s) supporting ramp-down? I.e. through the business deployment role. •Exception management: What is the impact to cutover if business burndown tasks can’t be completed to their schedule time? Are any adjustments required to tasks within the cutover plan, is there an action for the business to complete this post-cutover or not? Who must be involved to support triage and next steps? E.g. Conversion team, Business SMEs, Business Deployment, Business Unit Lead(s). n/a BCPKEY QUESTION | Are there business critical work items that relevant business units should be progressing, even while the core system is down for cutover? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Have any reports or data extracts been generated and sent to relevant business units enable them to work under BCP conditions? n/a Go-live Catch-up processing KEY QUESTION | Is there a need for the business to support any unplanned processing tasks that were a result of cutover issues? E.g. cutover processes errored and require one-off business action to manually process errored items. KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Post-cutover adjustments.How does this change the priority of tasks, and by when must these new tasks be completed (e.g. to ensure adherence to SLAs, or completion prior to relevant business events)? •Enabling information.Do relevant business teams have access to the necessary information to complete these unplanned tasks? n/a Issuing go- live comms & marketing material KEY QUESTION | Is comms and marketing engaged through the cutover period and updating content based on updates resulting from cutover issues? KEY CONSIDERATIONS: •Are any final amendments required to go-live comms before issuing to internal and external groups? E.g. unexpected cutover issues require a specific work-around to be detailed, or a change to the time of system/channel start-up etc? •Are channel teams on standby to enable updated messaging to be published quickly across the relevant channels? E.g. IR website (outage banners and service update page), myIR login page (Splash page outage message). •Do we have the right coverage of comms out to partnering agencies and organisations – i.e. messaging delivered at both the executive level and to the technical teams supporting cutover. n/a – OCMT and Marketing managed comms plans.

Deployment Sizing Framework This Section Covers: A framework for sizing the deployment and cutover associated with a release, and recommendations for down-sizing the BT Deployment Framework for smaller sized releases. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The BT Deployment Framework and associated activities, artefacts, and events have been developed by the Deployment Services Team for the purpose of guiding the deployment planning, preparation, and cutover of BT major releases. These cutover events are complex, long-running, and disruptive. The deployment framework reflects this through a number of detailed planning and rehearsal activities that serve to validate the cutover approach, and build confidence that the cutover outcome will be ‘go-live’ as opposed to ‘rollback’. However, very few releases are as large scale and complex as BT major releases. This will be particularly true for IR once the BT delivery is complete and the organisation has fully transitioned to the enduring core tax and solution policy solution that the BT programme implemented. At this point IR’s Change and Release model is expected to shift to deliver smaller scale and more frequent releases (in contrast to the approximately once-yearly BT major releases). To avoid over-investment in deployment planning for smaller scale releases, the deployment framework (and associated activities, artefacts, and events) must be capable of being right-sized to reflect the relative cutover size and risk profile associated with smaller releases. Right-sizing Deployment & Cutover Effort BT Major Releases vs Other Releases IR releases, and their associated cutover events, are expected to be smaller scale and less complex beyond the final BT majorrelease. How does the BT Deployment Framework scale to allow these cutovers to be sufficiently planned and proven without significant over-investment that the Deployment Framework for BT Major Releases would result in? •Large volume data migration, and associated reconciliation of business data and crown accounts. •Long running cutover window – i.e. 3-7 days – with associated outages resulting in: oDisruption to core business functions caused by core system outages. oLarge customer impact caused by outage to key channels – e.g. myIR, Contact Centre, Front of House. •Co-existence dependencies between systems on the Heritage and NSP platforms. Areas of High Cutover Risk Associated with BT Major Releases •Dedicated deployment team with 8-12 month lead time to plan and validate the production cutover. •Multiple cutover dress rehearsals to validate the plan. •Enterprise change freeze to support production stability in the lead-up to cutover. •Extensive external comms to customer segments and partners to communicate cutover outage and associated impacts. •Detailed cutover planning across multiple technical, business, and external groups – with on-going revision and refinement required. Controls for Managing High Risk Profile for BT Major Release Cutovers LARGE cutover risk profile caused by long running, disruptive, and complex cutover LARGE investment in risk mitigation controls required to provide assurance of successful cutover Question Cutover Complexity Negligible Complexity Low Complexity Medium Complexity High Complexity Cutover Disruption Negligible Disruption Standard P3/P4 break-fix Small Risk Profile Small Risk Profile N/A Low Disruption Small Risk Profile Small Risk Profile Medium Risk Profile N/A Medium Disruption Small Risk Profile Medium Risk Profile Medium Risk Profile Large Risk Profile High Disruption N/AN/A Large Risk Profile Large Risk Profile The risk profile associated with a cutover is the primary input for determining the amount of planning, validating, and preparin g that is necessary to prove readiness for cutover and ultimately receive formal approval to proceed with deploying the change. The greater a cutover risk profile is: •The greater likelihood there is of issues arising during cutover that result in a ‘rollback’ as opposed to a ‘go-liv e’ decision. •The greater the reputational damage to IR of failing to successfully go-live at the planned and communicated milestone date. •The more time and/or effort is required to plan and prepare for a reattempt of the cutover. T he sizing matrix below can be used to determine cutover risk by considering a combination of: •How disruptive the cutover is – g reater disruption leads to more business and customer impact. •How complex the cutover is –greater complexity increases the likelihood of business critical issues arising during the time-pressured cutover window. The sizing matrix is ultimately an extension of the BT Deployment Framework. It should be used to right-size the level of cutover and deployment planning and preparation. As with the deployment framework it focuses specifically on cutover impacts and does not consider the broader change impacts associated with each release. As such, it should not be used to inform the planning of other release elements outsideof deployment & cutover (e.g. org. change management and training, testing etc). Examples of Different Sized Releases •Large: BT major release cutovers, START major version upgrades. •Medium: Launching a new product in START (e.g. small business cashflow scheme) •Small: Minor functional or technical enhancements from production support backlog.

Each cutover domain comprises a number of categories. The highest rating category determines the impact score for that respective domain. Cutover complexity comprises a set of categories covering both technical and business elements, however they are not assessedseparately – i.e. high technical complexity and low business impact still results in a ‘high impact’ score for cutover complexity and vice versa.

Te utu i ngā utu tautoko tamaiti Making child support payments
==============================================================

Child support payments are due from the [liable parent](/api/glossary/item?id={2BD1C350-B91A-4EA6-A784-C7C311502E33})
 on the 20th of the month. We pay them to the [receiving carer](/api/glossary/item?id={ECAE3AEF-DAB7-4A41-BB04-B4E94EFA1B55})
 by the 23rd of the month.

Compulsory employer deductions
------------------------------

### From October 2021

If you're a liable parent, it is compulsory for you to pay by deductions from your income if you earn salary and wages. We'll let your employer know when and how much to deduct.

### Before October 2021

If you were registered as a liable parent before October 2021, you can choose whether to pay by employer deductions or to pay by other payment options - for example, payment plan, direct debit or credit card. However, if you miss payments, you’ll be registered automatically to make payments through compulsory employer deductions.

There are times when we may agree to you organising your payments yourself, even when you are earning salary or wages. For example, because your income is irregular.

If Work and Income pay you a benefit, they'll deduct your child support payments before your benefit is paid to you. We'll let Work and Income know when and how much to deduct.

Let us know if you change jobs or stop or start a benefit. By letting us know, we can help you make sure you still make your payments on time.

Other payment options
---------------------

If you do not have employer deductions for child support payments, there are other ways to pay.

### Child support payment plan

If you do not have salary or wages we can deduct child support from, you may want to use our child support payment plan. The plan will help you remember how much to pay and the date the payments are due.

You can choose to pay weekly, fortnightly or monthly and we'll work out how much you need to pay. You can set this up by calling us or doing it yourself in myIR.

[Set up a child support payment plan](/child-support/managing/making-payments/set-up-a-child-support-payment-plan)

### Direct debit

When you set up a direct debit, it means you're letting us take a certain amount of money from your bank account. You can set up regular payments or make a one-off payment. Direct debits can be from New Zealand and some overseas banks.

[Set up a direct debit](/managing-my-tax/make-a-payment/ways-of-paying/paying-electronically/set-up-direct-debit)

### Credit card or debit card online

You can make payments to us with credit and debit cards. We accept Visa and Mastercard.

The bank charges a convenience fee of 1.42% for any credit or debit card payment made to us. Convenience fees are charged and paid directly to the bank. There may be a delay in processing the fee (up to 24 hours) and it will show as a separate transaction on your bank statement. 

You need to log into myIR to make credit or debit card payments.

Making sure multinationals pay their fair share
===============================================

**18 February 2019**

New Zealand is to consult on the design of changes to tax rules which currently allow multinational companies in the digital services field to do business here without paying income tax.

Finance Minister Grant Robertson and Revenue Minister Stuart Nash say Cabinet has agreed to issue a discussion document about how to update our tax framework to ensure multinational companies pay their fair share of tax in this country.

“Highly digitalised companies, such as those offering social media networks, trading platforms, and online advertising, currently earn a significant income from New Zealand consumers without being liable for income tax. That is not fair, and we are determined to do something about it,” Grant Robertson said.

“International tax rules have not kept up with modern business developments. In the longer term this threatens the sustainability of our revenue base and the fairness of the tax system.

“The current tax rules also provide a competitive advantage to foreign companies in the digital services field compared to local companies who offer e-commerce, online advertising, and social networking services.

“The value of cross-border digital services in New Zealand is estimated to be around $2.7 billion. We are determined to ensure that multinational companies involved in this sector of the economy pay their fair share of tax. Our revenue estimate for a digital services tax is between $30 million and $80 million, which depends on how it is designed,” Grant Robertson said.

“New Zealand is currently working at the OECD to find an internationally agreed solution for including the digital economy within tax frameworks,” Stuart Nash said.

“Our preference is to continue working within the OECD, which was also recommended last year by the interim report of the Tax Working Group. However, we believe we need to move ahead with our own work so that we can proceed with our own form of a digital services tax, as an interim measure, until the OECD reaches agreement.

“This is the same approach being considered by Australian authorities, who released a discussion document late last year. The OECD has also released a discussion document on its proposals. Officials will now finalise the New Zealand document which is likely to be publicly released by May 2019.

“The document will make it clear we are determined that multinational companies pay their fair share of tax. We are committed to finding an international solution within the OECD but would also consider an interim option till the OECD finalises a position,” Stuart Nash said.
