1 Unclassified Note (not part of the Rulings): These Rulings are a reissue of BR Pub 14/01 to 14/05 and apply from the beginning of the first day of the 2017/18 income year (ie the date of the expiry of the previous Rulings). These five Public Rulings, BR Pub 18/01 to BR Pub 18/05, deal with the ability of a New Zealand resident partner of an Australian limited partnership to claim foreign tax credits for Australian income tax and dividend withholding tax paid by an Australian limited partnership. The Rulings do not consider any other situations involving foreign income and foreign tax paid. The Rulings discuss Australian limited partnerships that are corporate limited partnerships for Australian tax purposes and are treated under Australian tax law as companies while in New Zealand they retain partnership and flow through tax treatment. A foreign tax credit will be available to the New Zealand partners of an Australian limited partnership for Australian income tax or dividend withholding tax that is paid by the limited partnership in certain situations (detailed below). The amount and timing of the tax credit is determined under subpart LJ of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Foreign tax credits for Australian tax paid by Australian limited partnerships are available to New Zealand resident partners, in proportion to their partnership share, when all the following are met:  the Australian limited partnership is treated as a company for Australian income tax purposes but not for New Zealand tax purposes;  the income on which the tax was paid is assessable in New Zealand; and  the Australian tax paid was paid on the income that is assessable in New Zealand. 2 Unclassified Background 2. The question being considered is whether a foreign tax credit is available to New Zealand residents that earn Australian source income through a limited partnership registered in a state of Australia (that is an Australian limited partnership). 3. BR Pub 18/01 to BR Pub 18/05 are reissues of BR Pub 14/01 to BR Pub 14/05 published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 6 (July 2014). BR Pub 14/01 to BR Pub 14/05 were reissues of BR Pub 10/01 to BR Pub 10/05 and expired on the last day of the 2016/17 income year. 4. The relevant Australian limited partnerships are those that are treated as corporate limited partnerships for Australian income tax purposes, under s 94D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust), but do not meet the definition of “company” in s YA 1 of the New Zealand Income Tax Act 2007. The Australian law on limited partnerships registered in Australia and the Australian tax treatment must be considered before looking at the relevant foreign tax credit legislation in New Zealand. Australian partnerships 5. There are three types of Australian partnerships. The three types are:  (ordinary) partnerships; 1  limited partnerships; and  incorporated limited partnerships. 6. The three different types of partnerships are taxed differently under Australian income tax law. (Ordinary) partnerships 7. The first, and most common, type of Australian partnership is an ordinary partnership. The regulation of ordinary partnerships in Australia falls under state law which includes the:  Partnership Act 1958 (Victoria);  Partnership Act 1892 (New South Wales);  Partnership Act 1891 (Queensland);  Partnership Act 1963 (Australian Capital Territory);  Partnership Act 1891 (South Australia);  Partnership Act 1891 (Tasmania);  Partnership Act 1997 (Northern Territory); and  The Partnership Act 1895 (Western Australia). 8. These Acts provide that an ordinary partnership is the relation between people carrying on a business in common with a view of profit. The partners are jointly and severally liable for the legal actions and debts of the partnership, have management control, share the profits of the partnership in predefined proportions, and have apparent authority as 1 Referred to as “partnerships” in Australian state legislation. 3 Unclassified agents of the partnership to bind all the other partners in contracts with third parties. An ordinary partnership is not a separate legal entity. Limited partnerships 9. The second type of Australian partnership is a limited partnership. Limited partnerships in Australia can be formed and registered only under:  Part 3, ss 49 – 79 Partnership Act 1958 (Victoria);  Part 3, ss 50A – 81A Partnership Act 1892 (New South Wales);  Chapter 3, ss 48 – 69 Partnership Act 1891 (Queensland);  Part 3, ss 47-84 – Partnership Act 1891 (South Australia);  Part 3, ss 50 – 101 Partnership Act 1891 (Tasmania); and  Limited Partnership Act 2016 (Western Australia). 10. The state laws require a limited partnership to satisfy the general law requirements of a partnership (set out at \[8\] above), as far as they are consistent with the requirements for a limited partnership discussed below. The partnership laws of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory do not allow for limited partnerships; they only allow for incorporated limited partnerships. 11. The provisions, listed above, provide that a limited partnership is one where there are both general partners and limited partners. The general partners have the rights and obligations as in an ordinary partnership. The limited partners are not jointly and severally liable for the debts of the partnership and their exposure is limited to their partnership investments, and a corresponding share of the profits. The limited partners also cannot participate in the management of the partnership or act as an agent for the partnership. Despite the limited liability of the limited partner(s), a limited partnership does not have a separate legal identity (unless it is an incorporated limited partnership). Incorporated limited partnerships 12. The third type of Australian partnership is an incorporated limited partnership. An incorporated limited partnership is a type of limited partnership, but because of its incorporation it is treated differently under Australian law. Incorporated limited partnerships can be formed in all Australian states and territories. An incorporated limited partnership is a partnership that must have at least one general partner and one limited partner. Under the relevant state laws, the partnership is a separate legal entity with the powers and capacity of a natural person subject to the limitations in the partnership agreement. As discussed below, an incorporated limited partnership is not a partnership under New Zealand’s Income Tax Act 2007 because it is a separate legal entity under Australian state laws. As a result, incorporated limited partnerships are not covered by these Rulings. 4 Unclassified Australian tax treatment of Australian limited partnerships 13. A “limited partnership” is defined in s 995-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Aust) 2 as: (a) an association of persons (other than a company) carrying on business as partners or in receipt of ordinary income or statutory income jointly, where the liability of at least one of those persons is limited; or (b) an association of persons (other than one referred to in paragraph (a)) with legal personality separate from those persons that was formed solely for the purpose of becoming a VCLP, an ESVCLP, an AFOF or a VCMP and to carry on activities that are carried on by a body of that kind. 3 Corporate limited partnerships 14. Section 94D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust), Corporate Limited Partnerships, provides that a limited partnership is a corporate limited partnership if:  the year of income is the 1995-96 or later year of income; or  the partnership was formed on or after 19 August 1992; or  the partnership was formed before 19 August 1992 and either it does not pass the continuity of business test set out in Division 5A at s 94E, or there has been a change in composition of the partnership after 19 August 1992 and no election has been made by the partners under s 94F that the partnership not be treated as a corporate limited partnership; and  the limited partnership is not either a foreign hybrid limited partnership 4 in relation to the particular year of income, or a VCLP, an ESVCLP, an AFOF or a VCMP. 15. These rulings only apply to limited partnerships that are also corporate limited partnerships under s 94D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust). Corporate limited partnerships do not have identities separate from their members. Section 94D excludes certain limited partnerships (VCLP, ESVCLP, AFOF, venture capital management partnerships, and foreign hybrid limited partnerships (defined in footnote 3 below)) from being corporate limited partnerships. 16. Division 5A concerns the taxation of limited partnerships. Nothing in Division 5A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust) overrides the state partnership laws by recharacterising limited partnerships as companies. Division 5A simply treats a limited partnership that also meets the test for a corporate limited partnership as a company for certain Australian income tax purposes. In particular, subdivision C of Division 5A provides: 2 The definition in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust) is the same and referenced to that in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Aust). 3 A VCLP is a venture capital limited partnership and defined in s 118-405(2) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Aust); an ESVCLP is an early stage venture capital limited partnership and defined in s 118-407(4) of the 1997 Act; an AFOF is an Australian venture capital fund of funds defined in s 118-410(3) of the 1997 Act and a venture capital management partnership is defined in s 94D(3) of the 1936 Act. In all cases these types of limited partnership must have been registered under Part 2 of the Venture Capital Act 2002 (Aust). 4 A foreign hybrid limited partnership is formed outside Australia as defined in ss 830-10(1) and (2) of Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Aust). 5 Unclassified  company includes a reference to a corporate limited partnership (s 94J);  partnership does not include a reference to a corporate limited partnership (s 94K);  dividend includes a reference to a distribution made by a corporate limited partnership (s 94L). 17. This is discussed in the explanatory memorandum to the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 6) 1992 (Aust) that accompanied the introduction of subdivision C Division 5A: Under the existing law, limited partnerships are treated as partnerships for taxation purposes. However, the structure of a limited partnership is comparable to that of a limited liability company in that there are "limited partners" who are similar to shareholders in a company; they do not take part in the management of the business, and their liability generally is limited to the extent of their investment. Limited partners are not at risk beyond the limit of their liability. Generally, their liability is limited to their investment. They are not required to make good losses of their partnership, nor are they liable to meet the obligations of the partnership. If limited partners are treated in the same way as partners in any other partnership, however, they may benefit from distributions of losses that exceed their limited liability. Those losses could be used to reduce taxable income, and so tax paid, even though the loss is not one that exposes the partner to any risk of having to meet obligations or make good losses. State legislation enabling the formation of limited partnerships currently exists in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania. Explanation of proposed amendments The Bill will amend the Principal Act to introduce taxation arrangements in new Division 5A of Part III of the Act for taxing limited partnerships ... The object of this new Division is to ensure that limited partnerships will be treated as companies for taxation purposes. This is not confined to the payment of income tax by limited partnerships, but includes all other purposes under income tax law, including the payment of tax by partners in limited partnerships; for instance, imputation and the taxation of dividends to shareholders ... \[Emphasis added\] Australian tax consolidated groups 18. The introduction of Australia’s consolidation rules reinforced that corporate limited partnerships are to be treated as companies for Australian income tax law. The explanatory memorandum to the New Business Tax System (Consolidation) Act (No. 1) 2002 (Aust) makes it clear that corporate limited partnerships can also be head companies within that regime because they are sufficiently equivalent to a company for Australian income tax purposes. 3.29 To qualify as a head company, an entity must be a company as defined in s 995-1 of the ITAA 1997. 3.30 A corporate limited partnership will also satisfy this requirement. This is consistent with the objective of ensuring consolidated groups generally receive a tax treatment like ordinary companies because these partnerships are effectively treated as companies for income tax purposes. 19. The effect of becoming a head company in an Australian consolidated group is that all the income of the group is deemed to have been earned by the head company and not by the individual companies in the group: s 701-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Aust). 6 Unclassified Application of the Legislation Australian limited partnerships under New Zealand income tax law Legislation 20. As these rulings focus on the ability of New Zealand partners to claim foreign tax credits for tax paid or deducted by an Australian limited partnership, the key provisions in the Act are:  the definitions of “company”, “partnership”, and “limited partnership” in s YA 1;  section HG 2, which sets out that partnerships are transparent;  section CB 35, which sets out that income arising from subpart HG is assessable income to the partner;  section BH 1, which sets out the relationship between the Double Taxation Relief (Australia) Order 2010 and subpart LJ. The Schedule to the Double Taxation Relief (Australia) Order 2010 contains the Convention between Australia and New Zealand for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income and fringe benefits and the prevention of fiscal evasion (signed 29 June 2009, entered into force 18 March 2010) (the Australia and New Zealand Double Tax Agreement); and  subpart LJ, which determines the amount and timing of a foreign credit. 21. In addition to the above provisions, articles 1(2) and 23(3) of the Australia and New Zealand Double Tax Agreement provide New Zealand partners in an Australian limited partnership with relief for Australian income tax and dividend withholding tax paid by the limited partnership. 22. These provisions are discussed below. Limited partnerships 23. Section YA 1 sets out the definition of a company: Company - (a) means a body corporate or other entity that has a legal existence separate from that of its members, whether it is incorporated or created in New Zealand or elsewhere: (ab) does not include a partnership: ... (ac) includes a listed limited partnership: (ad) includes a foreign corporate limited partnership: (b) includes a unit trust: ... 24. A listed limited partnership and a foreign corporate limited partnership are also defined in s YA 1. In essence, they are defined respectively as a New Zealand or overseas limited partnership that is listed on a recognised exchange, and an overseas limited partnership that is treated as a separate legal entity under the partnership laws of the country concerned. 7 Unclassified 25. Unless an Australian limited partnership is listed on a recognised exchange or the underlying state partnership laws give it a separate legal personality, it will not meet the definition of a company in New Zealand. This is irrespective of whether it is treated as a company for Australian income tax purposes. 26. Section YA 1 defines:  “partnership” in paragraph (d) as meaning a limited partnership; and  “limited partnership” as including an overseas limited partnership as defined in s 4 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 but excluding a listed limited partnership or a foreign corporate limited partnership. 27. Section 4 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 defines an overseas limited partnership as: a partnership formed or incorporated outside New Zealand with — (a) 1 or more general partners who are liable for all of the debts and liabilities of the partnership; and (b) 1 or more limited partners who have only limited liability for the debts and liabilities of the partnership 28. Therefore, an Australian limited partnership that:  meets the definition of an “overseas limited partnership” under s 4 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008, and  is not listed on a recognised exchange, and  is not treated as a separate legal entity in Australia under Australian state partnership laws, will be treated as a partnership under New Zealand tax law. Partners in limited partnerships 29. The tax treatment of New Zealand partners in Australian limited partnerships that meet the definition of “partnership” in s YA 1 is set out in s HG 2(2): ... for a partner in their capacity of partner of a partnership, the amount of income, tax credit, rebate, gain, expenditure, or loss that they have from a particular source, or of a particular nature, is calculated by multiplying the total income, tax credit, rebate, gain, expenditure, or loss of the partners of the partnership from the particular source or of the particular nature by the partner’s partnership share in the partnership’s income. 30. “Partnership share” is defined in s YA 1 as meaning for a particular right, obligation, or other property, status or thing, the share that a partner has in the partnership. 31. The effect of s HG 2(2) and the definition of “‘partnership share” is that the assessable income of partners in a partnership includes their “partnership share” of the partnership income. Section CB 35 also confirms that this is assessable income of the partner: A person who is a partner has an amount of income to the extent to which an amount of income results from the application of subpart HG (Joint venturers, partners, and partnerships) to them and their partnership. 32. Section HG 2(2) also makes reference to tax credits. Section LA 10 provides that an amount is a tax credit of a person if it is their tax credit under a provision of Part L. Foreign tax credits arise under subpart LJ so 8 Unclassified are tax credits under s LA 10. Under s HG 2(2), therefore, partners are entitled to foreign tax credits in proportion to their partnership share. Foreign tax credits 33. The Australian tax considered in these rulings is income tax and dividend withholding tax. Section BH 1(4) means the Australia and New Zealand Double Tax Agreement has an overriding effect as to New Zealand income tax, including the income and tax credit sections of the Income Tax Act 2007. The income and tax credit sections, therefore, must be read together with the relevant Australia and New Zealand Double Tax Agreement articles. Where there is any inconsistency between the two, the domestic law must be read subject to the Australia and New Zealand Double Tax Agreement. The combined effect of the Australia and New Zealand Double Tax Agreement, and s BH 1 and subpart LJ of the Income Tax Act 2007 is that a New Zealand tax resident is allowed a tax credit for Australian income tax and dividend withholding tax. Articles 1(2) and 23(3) of the Australia and New Zealand Double Tax Agreement provide a New Zealand partner in an Australian limited partnership with relief for income tax or dividend withholding tax that the limited partnership pays in Australia. The relief is in the form of a tax credit in New Zealand under subpart LJ. Subpart LJ calculates the amount of the tax credit on the basis of a segment of foreign-sourced income under ss LJ 1(1), LJ 1(2)(a), and LJ 2(1): LJ 1 What this subpart does When tax credits allowed (1) This subpart provides the rules for dividing assessable income from foreign- sourced amounts into segments and allows a tax credit for foreign income tax paid in relation to a segment of that income. Limited application of rules (2) The rules in this subpart apply only when— (a) a person resident in New Zealand derives assessable income that is sourced from outside New Zealand; and ... LJ 2 Tax credits for foreign income tax Amount of credit (1) A person described in section LJ 1(2)(a) has a tax credit for a tax year for an amount of foreign income tax paid on a segment of foreign-sourced income, determined as if the segment were the net income of the person for the tax year. The amount of the New Zealand tax payable is calculated under section LJ 5. \[Emphasis added\]. 34. A “segment of foreign-sourced income” is defined in s LJ 4 as: an amount of assessable income derived from 1 foreign country that comes from 1 source or is of 1 nature. 35. Therefore three key elements must be satisfied for a New Zealand resident partner of an Australian limited partnership to be allowed a foreign tax credit under articles 1(2) and 23(3) of the Australia and New Zealand Double Tax Agreement, and ss BH 1, LJ 1 and HG 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007:  A person resident in New Zealand must derive assessable income sourced from outside New Zealand.  Foreign income tax must be paid. 9 Unclassified  That foreign income tax must be paid on that foreign-sourced assessable income. 36. It follows that a foreign tax credit is not available where:  There is no assessable income calculated under New Zealand tax law.  No foreign income tax has been paid.  The foreign income tax has not been paid on income that is assessable in New Zealand. 37. The foreign income tax could be Australian income tax or dividend withholding tax as appropriate. Examples 38. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. 39. This section of the commentary discusses the specific factual scenarios related to each of the five public rulings. In all cases they involve Australian tax being paid, but the issue is whether a foreign tax credit is available to the New Zealand partners. Whether a foreign tax credit is available turns on whether the three key elements set out above at \[35\] are satisfied. 40. In all five examples the Australian limited partnership (“ALP”) has three partners:  one general partner (“GP”) based in Australia having a 1% partnership share; and  two New Zealand resident limited partners (“NZLP 1” and “NZLP 2”) with 50% and 49% partnership shares respectively (the 50% and 49% partners). In examples 1, 2 and 5, NZLP 1 and NZLP 2 may be either a company or a natural person but in examples 3 and 4 are natural persons only. 41. The partners in examples 3 and 4 are limited to natural persons. If the partners were New Zealand resident companies the dividends would generally be exempt income under s CW 9(1), and so foreign tax credits would not be available. \[As an aside, dividends received by a company in New Zealand are not exempt if one of the exclusions in s CW 9(2) applies. The exclusions in s CW 9(2) include dividends paid in relation to rights that are:  a direct income interest in a foreign company that is a non-attributing interest in a FIF because it falls within one of the relevant exclusions in s CW 9(2)(a); or  a fixed-rate foreign equity (s CW 9(2)(b)); or  rights to a deductible foreign equity distribution (s CW 9(2)(c)). The Commissioner acknowledges that a New Zealand partner could hold a non-attributing interest in a FIF through an ALP, and any dividends received by a corporate partner in such circumstances would not be exempt income. If a partner’s interest is an attributing interest in a FIF, 10 Unclassified s LJ 2(6) and (7) specify which amount of income is to be used for the foreign tax credit provisions.\] 42. The Australian limited partnership is treated as a corporate limited partnership for Australian income tax law but is treated as a partnership for New Zealand income tax law (as discussed above). 43. To avoid currency exchange issues, the reference to “$” is not a reference to any particular currency; it is used simply for illustrative purposes. 11 Unclassified Example 1: Australian source income 44. ALP earns trading income in Australia of $100 and pays Australian income tax of $30 on it. 45. The trading income is partnership income to the partners, so they must include their partnership share in their New Zealand taxable income. The Australian income tax is allowed as a foreign tax credit in the same proportion as the partner’s partnership share. This is because the three key elements are met:  The partnership income is assessable to the partners under ss HG 2 and CB 35.  The ALP has paid Australian income tax on the income.  The Australian income tax was paid on the trading income of the ALP (which is the income that is assessable in New Zealand). 46. In the specific example, the 50% partner – NZLP 1 – has assessable income of $50 and a foreign tax credit of $15 and the 49% partner – NZLP 2 – has assessable income of $49 and a foreign tax credit of $14.70. These are their respective partnership shares of the trading income and the Australian income tax paid. 12 Unclassified Example 2: Distribution made by Australian limited partnership ALP unfranked distribution NZLP 1 New Zealand Australia GP Dividend withholding tax deducted LP 1 $7.50 LP 2 $7.35 1% Unfranked distribution / drawing $42.50 No FTC NZLP 2 Unfranked distribution / drawing $41.65 No FTC 47. The ALP makes an unfranked distribution to the partners of $100. For Australian income tax purposes, this distribution is treated as a dividend and Australian dividend withholding tax of 15% is deducted. The net amount distributed is then $85 in total. 48. In this situation only the second of the three elements has been met. While the Australian income tax – dividend withholding tax of 15% – has been paid, it has not been paid on New Zealand assessable income. This is because, for New Zealand income tax purposes, the distribution from a partnership would be drawings and not subject to New Zealand income tax. 49. Therefore, no foreign tax credit is available to the New Zealand partners. 50. Example 2, therefore, differs from example 1. In example 1, the partners are treated (under s HG 2) as deriving the income derived by the partnership. As a result, the partners in example 1 are treated as directly deriving the income. The income is taxable in the hands of the partners, and a foreign tax credit is available. 51. In example 2, the payment to the partners is a drawing down of the partners’ capital: Case F123 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,117. The payment does not relate to any income derived by the partnership that has flowed through to the partners under s HG 2. As the payment is drawings it is not taxable in the hands of the partners, and so no foreign tax credit is available. 13 Unclassified Example 3: Distribution made from unit trust 52. In example 3, the ALP owns units in a unit trust and the New Zealand partners are natural persons. As noted above at \[8\] and \[10\], one of the requirements for an ALP is that it is carrying on a business. The above ALP is in the business of managing various investments (including its investment in the unit trust). As seen above at \[23 \], a unit trust is included in the definition of “company” for New Zealand income tax purposes. The unit trust distributes income of $100 to the ALP and the ALP pays income tax on the distribution of $30. 5 53. The payment of the distribution from the unit trust to the ALP is a purely domestic transaction in Australia, so article 1(2) of the DTA does not affect Australia’s taxation rights on that transaction. This means that Australia is allowed to tax the ALP in example 3 to the extent allowed under its taxation laws (and so is not limited by the dividend article in the DTA to 15%). In accordance with the Australia and New Zealand Double Tax Agreement, New Zealand is required to provide relief in the form of foreign tax credits for the income tax paid in Australia by the ALP on the income that is assessable in New Zealand. 54. Under New Zealand income tax law the distribution from an Australian unit trust is treated as a dividend under s CD 1. 55. In this case all three elements are met: 5 Under Australian tax law, a distribution from a unit trust is taxed as a distribution from a trust or as a dividend from a company (depending on the circumstances of the unit trust). The reference in this example to a distribution includes both situations. 14 Unclassified  The dividend will be assessable income to the partners under ss CD 1 and HG 2.  Australian income tax has been paid.  The Australian income tax was paid on the distribution. 56. Therefore a foreign tax credit will be allowed in proportion to the partner’s partnership share of partnership income. Under subpart LJ, the foreign tax credit is limited to the notional tax liability that the taxpayer would have paid on the relevant segment of income in New Zealand. 6 In the current example the relevant partners are natural persons, so the tax credit is limited to their marginal tax rate (being 30% in this example). This means that the 50% partner – NZLP 1 – has dividend income of $50 and a foreign tax credit of $15, while the 49% partner – NZLP 2 – has dividend income of $49 and a foreign tax credit of $14.70. 57. If no Australian income tax is paid on the distribution, the New Zealand partners will not be entitled to a foreign tax credit. This example only deals with the situation where the ALP pays Australian income tax on the same segment of income that is taxable to the New Zealand partners (ie, the distribution). The example does not consider whether a foreign tax credit arises where the Australian unit trust pays tax on the income it derives. 58. Example 3 differs from example 2. The difference between the two examples is that there is assessable income in New Zealand in example 3. Specifically, the payment to the partners in example 2 is a drawing down of the partners’ capital and so is not assessable income in New Zealand. In contrast, in example 3 the partners are deemed to derive directly the dividend income derived by the partnership under s HG 2. The dividend is assessable income of the partners in New Zealand. 6 Under s LJ 5, the foreign tax credit is limited by the notional tax liability on the segment of foreign- sourced income determined as if that segment were the person’s net income for the tax year. The notional tax liability may be modified as necessary by s LJ 5(4). This means that the amount of the foreign tax credit cannot exceed the amount of tax that would have been payable on the income had a foreign tax credit not been available. 15 Unclassified Example 4: Franked dividend received by Australian limited partnership ALP ALP pays no tax as franking credit offsets tax liability. NZLP 2 New Zealand Australia GP Company Dividend $70 Franking Credit $30 $100 Dividend $34.30 No FTC NZLP 1 Dividend $35 No FTC 59. The ALP is treated as owning a subsidiary company under Australian tax law. The company pays a $70 franked dividend to the ALP. The New Zealand partners of the ALP are natural persons. The underlying basis of the franking credit was income tax the subsidiary company had paid previously on its trading income. While dividends received by the ALP are subject to tax in Australia, the attached franking credit offsets any tax liability on this dividend so the ALP does not pay tax on that income. 60. In this case, only the first element is satisfied. The dividend is assessable income to the partners under ss CD 1 and HG 2(2). The second and third elements are not satisfied because no Australian income tax has been paid on the dividend by the ALP. In Australia, a franking credit reduces the amount of income tax that a taxpayer has to pay: s 4-10 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Aust.). As a result, under the arrangement the ALP had a nil income tax liability for the relevant period, and so paid no income tax. Whatever income tax may have been paid by the subsidiary, the tax was not paid on the segment of income that the New Zealand partners are liable for income tax on (namely the dividend income). 61. In terms of New Zealand assessable income, however, there is dividend income of $35 and $34.30 to the 50% partner and 49% partner respectively. The dividend income derived by the New Zealand partners excludes the amount of franking credits used to reduce the amount of Australian income tax payable. 62. The Commissioner acknowledges that there may be situations where an ALP has insufficient franking credits to reduce the Australian income tax liability to nil. The ALP may then be required to pay the residual income tax liability. The second element would be satisfied in that situation to the extent of the residual income tax paid. In other words, where a dividend is only partially franked or not franked at all, then a foreign tax credit may arise for the income tax actually paid. 16 Unclassified Example 5: Tax paid by Australian limited partnership as “head company” of an Australian tax consolidated group 63. The ALP, as the head company for a consolidated group of companies (COY 1, COY 2 and COY 3), pays tax on all the taxable income of the consolidated group in Australia. This example excludes situations where one or more of the group entities are in a loss position. 64. The taxable income of the consolidated group is $3,200 and the income tax paid is $960. The group income includes income from the subsidiary companies of $3,000 and the fee income derived by the ALP of $200. 65. Under s HG 2(1) the New Zealand partners are treated as deriving the fee income derived by the ALP. The fee income is treated as assessable income of the partners sourced from outside New Zealand (satisfying the first element). The ALP has paid income tax on the fee income (satisfying the second and third elements). As a result, the three elements are met and a foreign tax credit will be available to the partners of the ALP but only to the extent that the tax paid relates to the fee income. 17 Unclassified 66. As noted above, the first element requires the New Zealand resident partner to derive assessable income sourced from outside New Zealand. The New Zealand partner, therefore, must derive income according to New Zealand tax law. In the case of the income from the Australian consolidated group of companies that income is not derived by the ALP for New Zealand tax purposes. 67. The New Zealand partners must return their share of the income derived directly by the ALP. That is, $100 and $98 for the 50% partner and 49% partner respectively. The New Zealand partners do not need to return income that was derived by the subsidiary companies. 68. A foreign tax credit will be available for the Australian income tax paid on the income earned directly by the ALP (subject to subpart LJ). In this case the foreign tax credit of $30 will be allowed to the 50% partner – NZLP 1 – and $29.40 to the 49% partner – NZLP 2. 18 Unclassified References Expired Rulings BR Pub 10/01 “Australian source income earned by Australian limited partnership and foreign tax credits” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011): 4- 14.

This Ruling covers the situation where a crypto-asset issued by the employer is a “share” in the employer (as defined in s YA 1). The commentary briefly discusses the application of the employee share scheme rules to the Arrangement. It also briefly discusses the definition of a “share” for tax purposes, and when crypto-assets may satisfy this definition. Background 2.The crypto-asset industry is still evolving and there is currently no standard terminology used. The Ruling uses the term “crypto-asset” to cover digital assets that use cryptography and blockchain technology to regulate their generation and verify transfers. 1 The Ruling also uses the term “equity token” to cover a specific subset of crypto-asset. 1 These are sometimes referred to by other terms including “cryptocurrencies” and “tokens”. WITHDRAWN 2 PUB 19/04 UNCLASSIFIED 3.It is becoming more common for employees (particularly those working in crypto- asset related industries) to receive remuneration in crypto-assets. The Commissioner has been asked to provide guidance on how remuneration paid in crypto-assets is taxed. 4.This Ruling sets out the Commissioner’s view on the situation where an employee receives crypto-assets issued by their employer or another company in the same group (referred to together as “the employer” for ease of reference) that is a “share”. This could occur in the context of an Initial Coin Offering, a Security Token Offering, an Initial Exchange Offering, a Token Generating Event or by other means. 5.The purpose of this Ruling and commentary is to raise awareness that a crypto- asset that provides an interest in the capital of a company may be subject to the employee share scheme rules. This Ruling does not provide detailed guidance on applying the employee share scheme rules. . Detailed guidance on applying the rules is provided in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 30 No 5 (June 2018):52. Application of the legislation When do the employee share scheme rules apply? 6.Section CE 1 sets out when an amount derived by a person in connection with their employment will be their income. Under s CE 1(1)(d), a benefit received by an employee under an “employee share scheme” is income derived in connection with their employment. 7.Section CE 7 provides for the meaning of an “employee share scheme” as follows: CE 7 Meaning of employee share scheme Employee share scheme means— (a)an arrangement with a purpose or effect of issuing or transferring shares in a company (company A) to a person— (i)who will be, is, or has been an employee of company A or of another company that is a member of the same group of companies as company A, if the arrangement is connected to the person’s employment or service: (ii)who will be, is, or has been a shareholder-employee in relation to company A or in relation to another company that is a member of the same group of companies as company A, if the arrangement is connected to the person’s employment or service: (iii)who is an associate of a person described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) (person A), if the arrangement is connected to person A’s employment or service; but... (b)does not include an arrangement that— (i)is an exempt ESS: (ii)requires market value consideration to be paid by a person described in paragraph (a) for the transfer of shares in the company on the share scheme taxing date: (iii)requires a person described in paragraph (a) to put shares, acquired by them for market value consideration, at risk, if the arrangement provides no protection against a fall in the value of the shares and none of the consideration for acquiring the shares is provided to the person under an agreement that it is used for acquiring the shares. 8.Accordingly, an employee share scheme is an arrangement that involves the issue or transfer of shares to an employee (or a person who has been or will be an WITHDRAWN 3 PUB 19/04 UNCLASSIFIED employee). The employee share scheme rules may also apply if the shares are issued to an associated person of the employee in connection with the employee’s employment. 9.The employee share scheme rules do not apply to arrangements that require employees to: •pay market value for the shares on the “share scheme taxing date” (generally the date on which the employee holds the shares like any other shareholder); or •put at risk shares they acquired for market value, where the scheme provides no protection to the person against a fall in the value of the shares. 10.The employee share scheme rules also do not apply to an exempt employee share scheme (referred to in the legislation as an “exempt ESS”), which is defined in s CW 26. This is discussed further from \[19\]. 11.Section CE 2 provides that an employee who has acquired shares under an employee share scheme receives a benefit as calculated under that section. In essence, the calculation refers to the difference between the value of the shares and what was paid for them. 12.The timing of the benefit is provided in s CE 7B, which, in brief, is the time at which the shares are held by (or for the benefit of) the employee, where there is no material risk that the ownership may change (for example, if the employee must remain employed for a certain period). 13.Where the crypto-assets are not held by (or for the benefit of) the employee, or there is a risk of a change of ownership of the crypto-assets or that the benefit may be cancelled, the share scheme taxing date will not be satisfied under s CE 7B. TIB Vol 30 No 5 (June 2018) contains numerous examples of how the share scheme taxing date is determined. For example, if crypto-assets are held on trust and an employee must remain in employment for 12 months before the crypto-assets are transferred to the employee, the share scheme taxing date is not satisfied until the employee becomes entitled to the crypto-assets. 14.The rules operate to tax any benefit conferred on an employee by the issuance of shares in an employee share scheme in the same way as if the employee had received an equivalent cash payment followed by an acquisition of shares. 15.Section RD 7B provides that an employer may choose whether to withhold and pay an amount of tax relating to the benefit, but it does not have to. If an employer does not choose to withhold and pay tax, the employee will be liable for tax on their employment income under s CE 1(1)(d) if they are a New Zealand resident, or a non-resident who has earned the amount here (s YD 4(4)). This is the case regardless of whether the employer is a resident or non-resident. 16.The employee share scheme rules apply only to employees and do not apply to arrangements that involve issuing shares to other providers of goods or services. What is a “share” for tax purposes? 17.As noted above, the employee share scheme rules apply where shares are issued to employees (and the employees do not pay market value for those shares). A “share” is not specifically defined for the purposes of s CE 7. A “share” is defined broadly in s YA 1 as follows: WITHDRAWN 4 PUB 19/04 UNCLASSIFIED share — (a)includes any interest in the capital of a company: (b)includes a debenture to which section FA 2 (Recharacterisation of certain debentures) applies: (bb) includes a stapled debt security to which section FA 2B(2) (Stapled debt securities) applies: (c)includes a unit in a unit trust: (d)includes an investor’s interest in a group investment fund if— (i)the fund is not a designated group investment fund; and (ii)the interest does not result from an investment from a designated source; and (iii)the investor’s interest does not result from an investment made in the fund on or before 22 June 1983, including an amount treated as invested at that date as pre-1983 investments under section HR 3(8) (Definitions for section HR 2: group investment funds): (e)does not include a withdrawable share in a building society, except in the definitions of investment society dividend and withdrawable share: (f)\[Repealed\] (g)is further defined in section CW 26F (Meaning of share) for the purposes of section CW 26C (Meaning of exempt ESS) 18.The Commissioner considers that the most relevant definition for the purposes of this Ruling is that contained in para (a) above. This definition includes “any interest in the capital of a company”. The definition of a “share” also specifically includes many instruments that are not shares under the Companies Act 1993 (CA 1993) such as profit related debentures, stapled debt securities, units in a unit trust, and interests in a group investment fund. These are all types of instruments that exhibit general features of equity. 19.Paragraph (g) above contains a specific definition in the context of employee share schemes. Section CW 26F provides: CW 26F Meaning of share For the purposes of section CW 26C, share means, for a company whose shares are made available under an exempt ESS, a fully paid ordinary share that ranks equally with, and has the same designation as, an existing ordinary voting share in the company. 20.This definition is limited to s CW 26C, which relates to an exempt ESS. Accordingly, this specific definition of a share (being one that is a fully paid ordinary share ranking equally with existing ordinary voting shares) is relevant only for determining whether there is an exempt ESS for the specific purposes of s CW 26C. This is because an exempt ESS must be widely offered to almost all employees and provide the same rights to all employees. This narrow definition of a share for these specific purposes would relate to all types of shares (whether in the more traditional sense or any crypto-assets that satisfy the definition in s YA 1). 21.The definition of “exempt ESS” is set out in the Appendix. Whether or not there is an exempt ESS in any particular circumstances is outside the scope of this Ruling. What does “any interest in the capital of a company” mean? 22.The phrase “any interest in the capital of a company” reflects the common law meaning of a “share” rather than the CA 1993. For income tax purposes, this definition first appeared in the definition of a “shareholder” in the Land and Income Tax Act 1916 and has remained essentially unchanged from its original enactment WITHDRAWN 5 PUB 19/04 UNCLASSIFIED (at which time the Companies Act 1903 was in force), despite the companies legislation undergoing significant changes since that time. 23.The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, 2011) defines an “interest” as: interest ... 4 a share or involvement in an undertaking. a legal concern, title, or right in property... 24.The ordinary meaning of “any interest” is broad, and can include a share, legal concern, title, right or claim. The use of the word “any” also indicates that the term takes a broad meaning for these purposes. 25.“Capital” is also a broad term and a company’s capital may generally include assets, the sum of shareholders’ contributions to a company, the stock with which a company enters business and accumulated wealth. 26.In IRC v Woolf \[1962\] 1 Ch 35, the English Court of Appeal was considering whether debenture holders were “members” of a company, which was defined with reference to whether they had “an interest in the capital or profits or income” of the company. Upjohn LJ said at 46 and 47: The share or interest of a member in the capital of a company has no precise legal signification. In the context it may refer to the share or interest of the member in the issued share capital, or it may refer to his ultimate right to receive a dividend in liquidation after all creditors have been discharged... ... ... Further, the debenture-holder has no interest in the capital of the company. If “capital” refers to the share capital, that is obviously so. If it refers to the surplus in a winding-up, the debenture-holder will have been paid off before the surplus can be ascertained. 27.Upton LJ considered there needed to be a right or an expectation to share in a company’s share capital or net capital (being the difference between assets and liabilities), even if that were through a liquidation of the company. A creditor does not hold an interest in the capital of a company, but rather holds an interest in its assets. These comments indicate that an “interest in capital” is a participating interest, suggesting a participation in the surplus assets on winding up of a company. A contractual debt interest is not sufficient. 28.Similarly, Donovan LJ said at 45: The word “capital”, where it occurs as part of the definition of “member”, may mean issued share capital or the net capital, being the difference between assets and liabilities, or it may mean both. ... 29.Accordingly, in Woolf, a reference to “capital” of a company was taken to mean share capital and net capital (assets less liabilities) and included the right to receive distributions on a winding up, after all creditors have been paid. 30.Earlier case law on the meaning of a “share” (for companies law purposes) took a narrower view of capital, referring more specifically to “share capital”. For instance, in Borland’s Trustee v Steel Brothers and Co Ltd \[1901\] 1 Ch 279 Farwell J stated at 288: A share is the interest of a shareholder in the company measured by a sum of money, for the purpose of liability in the first place, and of interest in the second... A share is not a sum of money settled in the way suggested, but is an interest measured by a sum of money and made up of various rights contained in the contract, including the right to a sum of money of a more or less amount. WITHDRAWN 6 PUB 19/04 UNCLASSIFIED 31.In Bradbury v English Sewing Cotton Co Ltd \[1923\] AC 744 (HL) Lord Wrenbury stated at 767: ... A share is, therefore, a fractional part of the capital. It confers on the holder a certain right to a proportionate part of the assets of the corporation, whether by way of dividend or of distribution of assets in winding-up. 32.The concept of a share relating to a fractional part of capital is no longer relevant under the CA 1993, which provides that a share is personal property and provides a bundle of rights (being the rights generally set out in s 36 of the CA 1993, but which may be varied by the constitution or terms of issue of the share). 33.The decision in Inland Revenue Commissioners v Tring \[1939\] 2 All ER 105 (CA) also focused on whether a person held an interest in the capital of the company. The Court of Appeal upheld Macnaghten J’s decision in the lower court (Inland Revenue Commissioners v Tring \[1939\] 1 All ER 148). Macnaghten J had stated at 152: I think that the words “share or interest in the capital or profits or income of a company” mean just what they say – anybody who has either a share in the capital or profits or income or has any interest in the capital or profits or income. I think the word “capital” there may cover, not only share capital, but also the pecuniary capital of a company, its capital assets. 34.Accordingly, “any interest in the capital of a company” for the purposes of the definition of a “share” in s YA 1 may refer to the person’s interest in issued share capital, and a right to a share in the surplus assets on a wind up, and may include rights to other distributions. An interest in a company’s capital is an interest in the performance of the company that is of an equity nature (rather than a debt or contractual right to receive payments). 35.In the GST context, the High Court in CIR v Gulf Harbour Development Ltd \[2004\] 2 NZLR 768 (HC) considered whether redeemable preference shares (RPS) were an “equity security” for GST purposes. An “equity security” is similarly defined for GST purposes as a “share in the capital of a body corporate”. The RPS provided rights to membership in a club, but excluded voting rights, dividends and a share of surplus assets over and above what the members had put in. The High Court noted that the reference to a “share in the capital of a body corporate” was based on the companies legislation although (at \[42\] to \[43\]) noted that the CA 1993 had removed any reference to capital from the share definition, and instead introduced the solvency test. The court concluded: \[47\] It is undeniable that “membership shares” are “redeemable shares” within the meaning of s 68. It is also undeniable that the holder of the redeemable share contributes to “the capital of a body corporate” where, as here, the holder of the redeemable share has an entitlement in the event of liquidation within 75 years to return of the investment. That is in a very real sense “an interest in or right to a share in the capital” despite that fact that after 75 years the company may redeem the share for payment of $1 and the “share” will be a tiny fraction of the consideration originally paid. 36.The RPS holder contributed to the capital of the company where they had an entitlement in a liquidation (within 75 years) to a return of the investment. Relevantly for the present context, the decision indicates that an instrument that allows the holder to receive a return of the amounts contributed in a liquidation could satisfy the phrase “any interest in the capital of a company”. When could crypto-assets issued by an employer be a share? 37.This Ruling applies to certain types of crypto-assets (which may commonly be described as “equity” tokens) that provide ownership interests in entities. An WITHDRAWN 7 PUB 19/04 UNCLASSIFIED equity token is a type of security token representing ownership or an interest in a venture. Equity tokens may provide holders with voting interests and an entitlement to a share in profits of a venture but these may not necessarily be a share unless they provide an interest in the company’s capital. This distinction is important. The Ruling does not apply to all equity tokens, but only those that provide an interest in the capital of the company that issues them. In addition, the Ruling does not apply to other types of tokens (e.g. other security tokens, intrinsic tokens, asset tokens or utility tokens) unless they contain hybrid features and include interests in the capital of the company. The token issuance could occur as part of an Initial Coin Offering or Token Generating Event undertaken by the employer, or in other circumstances. 38.Crypto-assets that provide an interest in the capital of a company, such as the right to receive a share in the surplus assets on a winding up of the company and potentially other distributions from the company, will be a “share” for income tax purposes. To qualify as a share, the interests need to be by way of an equity interest in the company’s performance, and not simply a debt or other contractual right to receive payments. For completeness, the relevant interest must be in a company, so this would not include any interests in a decentralised autonomous organisation that operates over the blockchain, nor would it include a token that only provides interests in a platform. 39.Given that this will be highly fact specific and will depend on the terms of each particular crypto-asset issued, this Ruling does not rule on when a crypto-asset will be a “share”. To determine whether a crypto-asset is a “share” it will be necessary to carefully consider the terms and conditions on which the crypto-asset is issued. This commentary can be used as guidance. 40.As an aside, given the broad definition of a “share” for tax purposes, there is often different categorisation of instruments for company law and regulation purposes. Crypto-assets that are a “share” for tax purposes may not necessarily be a “share” for the purposes of the CA 1993 or an “equity security” under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMCA 2013). For example, a profit-related debenture is a “share” for income tax purposes, a “debt security” for GST purposes, a “debt security” under the FMCA 2013, and is not a share under the CA 1993. The intention of including various equity instruments as a share for tax purposes is to generally treat instruments that have equity features as being a share if they involve distributions of company profits to the holder (and the holder has essentially borne the economic cost of the tax paid by the company). 41.Accordingly, crypto-assets issued by an employer that provide employees with certain rights such as a right to share in surplus assets on a wind up, will be a “share” under s YA 1 (even if not a “share” for the purposes of the CA 1993 or an “equity security” under the FMCA 2013). The issue of such crypto-assets to employees will be within the definition of an “employee share scheme” in s CE 7, and subject to s CE 2. If an employee receives crypto-assets from an employer under an employee share scheme and pays less than market value, the difference between the market value and any amount they paid will be employment income under s CE 1(1)(d). 42.Accordingly, the Commissioner considers that the employee share scheme rules will apply in circumstances where an employer issues crypto-assets to employees in connection with their employment, and: •the crypto-assets provide an interest in the capital of the company; •the employer does not require the employees to pay market value for the crypto-assets; and WITHDRAWN 8 PUB 19/04 UNCLASSIFIED •the provision of the crypto-assets is not an exempt ESS. Examples 43.The following two examples explain the application of the law. Example 1: Crypto-assets that provide interests in a platform 44.DigitalKeyChain Ltd, a New Zealand incorporated limited liability company, is developing a new blockchain based platform for property sales. DigitalKeyChain Ltd issues its own crypto-asset, D-KEYs, by way of an ICO. 45.DigitalKeyChain Ltd employs five full time employees. As DigitalKeyChain Ltd is unable to pay competitive rates, it proposes to provide each of the full-time employees with D-KEYs issued in the ICO to the value of NZD$5,000. 46.The D-KEY whitepaper provides that a certain number of D-KEYs are required for users to access the platform and provides holders with voting rights over the operation of the platform. 47.The D-KEYs are not “shares” as they do not provide an interest in the capital of DigitalKeyChain Ltd. Accordingly, the employee share scheme rules do not apply. However, other employment income rules are likely to apply to the benefit received by the employees (as set out in BR PUB 19/03: Income Tax – employer issued crypto-assets provided to an employee). Example 2: Crypto-assets that provide rights on a wind-up 48.Assume that, in addition to the facts set out above, the whitepaper and relevant terms and conditions of issue provide that D-KEY holders will receive (at the discretion of the directors) a right to distributions of DigitalKeyChain Ltd’s profits. 49.The whitepaper and relevant terms and conditions also provide D-KEY holders with a right to a share in surplus assets on a liquidation of DigitalKeyChain Ltd after all creditors have been paid. In these circumstances, the D-KEYs are “shares” under s YA 1. 50.The employee share scheme rules will apply to the D-KEYs issued to the five employees. The employees did not pay anything for the receipt of the D-Keys, so the full market value will be employment income.

Investing into a US Limited Liability Company – NZ tax consequences (WITHDRAWN)
===============================================================================

These 5 rulings and the accompanying commentary set out the income tax treatment and availability of foreign tax credits for NZ investors in a US LLC that is taxed on a fiscally transparent basis as a partnership in the US, but as a foreign company in NZ. The Rulings demonstrate the different treatment depending on whether the interest in the US LLC is classified as under the FIF threshold, or as a FIF, or as a CFC. It then explores the impact for different categories of FIF (AFIM/other methods/non-attributing active FIF) and CFC (attributing/non-attributing active). There is also an analysis of the operation of the relevant fiscal transparency and double tax relief provisions (arts 1(6) and 22) in the NZ/US DTA.

PUBLIC RULING Goods and Services Tax – Debt factoring arrangements Issued: 17 June 2021 BR Pub 21/03 This Public Ruling considers whether a GST input tax deduction can be claimed for a bad debt write-off when a debt is factored. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GSTA) unless otherwise stated. START DATE 10/08/2021 REPLACES This is an update and reissue of BR Pub 06/01. For more information about earlier publications of this Public Ruling see the Commentary to this Ruling. 2 Public Ruling BR Pub 21/03: GST – Debt factoring arrangements This is a public ruling made under s 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation laws This Ruling applies in respect of ss 20(3)(i) and 26. The arrangement to which this Ruling applies The arrangement is the sale, by a GST registered person (the Assignor), to a third party (the Factor), on a recourse or non-recourse basis, of an outstanding debt at a price less than the debt’s face value. How the taxation laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows:  The difference between the face value of the debt and the price received from the Factor is not a bad debt for the purposes of s 26. Accordingly, s 26 has no application and the registered person cannot claim an input tax deduction under s 20(3)(i); and  If a portion of a debt is written-off before it is sold to the Factor, then whether this write-off meets the requirements of s 26(1) depends on whether the amount written off was “bad” according to the conventional tests as outlined in Public Ruling “BR Pub 18/07: Income tax and goods and services tax – writing off debts as bad” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 30, No 9 (October 2018) (BR Pub 18/07). The period or tax year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on 10 August 2021. This Ruling is signed by me on 17 June 2021.

When a registered person factors a debt owing for less than its face value, the issue arises whether the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor can be an amount “written off as a bad debt” under s 26(1). 2. The Commissioner considers that the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor cannot be an amount written off as a bad debt under s 26(1) and consequently no deduction from output tax can be claimed under s 20(3)(i). Rather than being a bad debt, the discount from face value is simply a BR Pub 21/03 | 17 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] result of the process of agreeing the consideration for the debt that is acceptable to both the Assignor and the Factor. 3. Whether a debt is written off as “bad” under s 26(1) depends on the application of the tests outlined in BR Pub 18/07. Background 4. BR Pub 21/03 is a reissue of BR Pub 06/01. This Ruling is essentially the same as BR Pub 06/01, which applied indefinitely from 1 August 2005. BR Pub 06/01 is withdrawn and this Ruling is reissued with updated legislative references and a refreshed commentary. 5. Sections 26 and 20(3)(i) of the GSTA allow a registered person to make a deduction from output tax if the registered person has made a taxable supply, returned output tax in respect of that taxable supply, and subsequently written off as a bad debt, all or part of the debt. 6. If a registered person factors (i.e. sells) a debt owing for less than its face value to a third party (the Factor), the issue arises whether the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor can be an amount written off as a bad debt. 7. A debt can be factored either on a recourse basis or on a non-recourse basis. Debt factoring on a non-recourse basis means that the Factor has no claim back to the Assignor if the debts sold to them become doubtful or uncollectable (i.e. the Factor assumes all of the risk). In contrast, debt factoring on a recourse basis means that the Factor has some form of claim back to the Assignor if the debts sold to them prove to be doubtful or uncollectible. 8. Historically, debt factoring was dealt with in PIB No 164 (August 1987) “GST and debt collection agencies – debt factoring” and in Technical Rulings paragraph 104.9.4 under an identical heading. Those statements concluded that if a registered person accounting for GST on an invoice basis subsequently sold a debt for less than its face value, the Commissioner would allow the registered person a bad debt deduction under s 26 for the difference between the debt’s face value and the sale proceeds. The inference being that the difference between the two amounts was a bad debt. 9. At that time, a person accounting for GST on an invoice basis was required to return GST on the full amount from the sale of goods or services at the time of supply, whereas a person accounting for GST on a payments basis was only required to return GST on the discounted amount received on the sale of the debt. The policy set out in BR Pub 21/03 | 17 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] PIB No 164 and Technical Rulings paragraph 104.9.4 addressed the mismatch of GST treatments between the two accounting bases under the GSTA. 10. Barber DJ in Case T27 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,188, however, reached a different conclusion from that set out in PIB No 164 and Technical Rulings paragraph 104.9.4. In particular, the Taxation Review Authority concluded that if a registered person factors a debt owing for less than its face value, the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor is not a bad debt. 11. Consequently, Public Ruling “BR Pub 00/07: Debt factoring arrangements and GST” (BR Pub 00/07) was published in 2000, which confirmed that the Commissioner accepted the view of Barber DJ in Case T27. The Ruling changed and superseded the earlier policy set out in PIB No 164 and Technical Rulings paragraph 104.9.4. 12. Further, section 26A was enacted in 2000 to require a person accounting for GST on a payments basis to return GST on the remaining book value of a debt when it is factored. Section 26A, therefore, establishes parity between the two GST accounting bases. 13. It is the Commissioner’s view that if a registered person factors a debt owing for less than its face value, the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor is not a bad debt. Accordingly, s 26 has no application, and a registered person cannot claim a deduction from output tax under s 20(3)(i) . 14. BR Pub 00/07 was replaced by “BR Pub 06/01: Debt factoring arrangements” (BR Pub 06/01) and GST in 2006 after BR Pub 00/07 expired. Both Public Rulings are essentially the same. This Ruling replaces BR Pub 06/01. Application of the legislation 15. This part of the commentary will briefly discuss the GST consequences for an Assignor when a debt is factored. It will then set out the reasons why the price difference between the face value of the debt and the price received from the Factor is not a bad debt amount. GST consequences when a debt is factored 16. When a debt is factored for less than its face value, there are differences in the way the GSTA operates for an Assignor, depending on whether the Assignor accounts for GST on an invoice basis or a payments basis. Despite these differences, the outcome since the enactment of s 26A is the same for both accounting bases ie, the Assignor is required to pay output tax on the face value of the debt and cannot claim an input tax BR Pub 21/03 | 17 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] deduction for a bad debt write off simply by accepting a lesser value by factoring the debt. Invoice basis 17. A person registered to account for GST on an invoice basis is liable for output tax on the supply of goods or services at the time an invoice is issued. 18. The subsequent factoring of the debt from the Assignor to the Factor would be considered a financial service under s 3(1)(c), being a transfer of ownership of a debt security. It is, therefore, an exempt supply under s 14(1). 19. Consequently, for an Assignor accounting for GST on an invoice basis, no GST liability is incurred at the time the debt is factored. Payments basis 20. A registered person accounting for GST on a payments basis, who has not received a payment for the supply of goods or services, is not liable for GST output tax at the time the goods or services was originally supplied. 21. The subsequent factoring of the debt for less than its face value would not be considered a supply of “financial services” under s 3(1) because of s 3(4)(a). Section 3(4)(a) applies where, as a result of the transfer of a debt, no output tax for the supply would be attributable to a taxable period. This means an Assignor accounting for GST on a payments basis would be required to return GST on the amount received from the sale because s 3(4)(a) makes that transaction a taxable supply when it would otherwise have been a financial service. 22. Furthermore, s 26A specifically requires a person registered to account for GST on a payments basis to return GST on the remaining book value of the debt when the debt is factored. 23. Therefore, by virtue of ss 3(4)(a) and 26A, the full face value of the debt is considered a taxable supply and an Assignor accounting for GST on a payments basis is liable for GST on the full amount of the debt at the time the debt is factored. Bad debt deduction 24. Under s 26, a registered person can make a deduction under s 20(3)(i) if that person has:  made a taxable supply for consideration; and BR Pub 21/03 | 17 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  furnished a return in relation to the taxable period during which the output tax on the supply was attributable and has properly accounted for the output tax on that supply as required under GSTA; and  written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person. 25. The amount that may be deducted is the same amount of GST charged as the amount written off bears to the total consideration for the supply. If the supply is the supply of goods under a hire purchase agreement, the proviso to s 26 limits the deduction to the portion of the amount written off as the cash price bears to the total amount payable under the hire purchase agreement. 26. Section 26(1AB) specifies that a registered person accounting for GST on a payments basis can apply s 26 to the supplies to which s 9(2)(b) (door to door sales), s 9(3)(b) (hire purchase agreements), or s 26A (accounting for GST on the remaining book value of a factored debt) applies. 27. If a registered person factors a debt owing for less than its face value, the issue arises whether the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor can be an amount “written off as a bad debt”. 28. The term “bad debt” is not defined in the GSTA. Whether the debt is written off as “bad”, according to the requirements in s 26(1), depends on the application of the tests outlined in BR Pub 18/07: 29. BR Pub 18/07 confirms that a debt (or part of a debt) is a bad debt where:  an existing debt is owing to the taxpayer; and  the debt is adjudged as “bad” by a reasonably prudent commercial person who concluded that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid in whole or in part by the debtor or by anyone else; and  the bad debt is “written off” in accordance with the accounting and record keeping systems maintained by the taxpayer. The debt must exist 30. Cases indicate that before a debt can be written off, a debt must be in existence at the time the debt is written off (Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,263 and GE Crane Sales Pty Ltd v FC of T 71 ATC 4268). Accordingly, for s 26 to apply, the registered person must be able to show that at the time of writing off the debt, a debt was then in existence. BR Pub 21/03 | 17 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 31. In terms of non-recourse debt factoring, at the time the debt is sold, the debt between the registered person and debtor is extinguished and replaced with a separate and distinct debt between the Factor and debtor. In such situations no debt exists at the time the amount is written off, which will be after sale of the debt. Therefore, after the sale of the debt to the Factor, no further debt exists and according to both Budget Rent A Car Ltd and G E Crane Sales Pty Ltd no amount can be written off as a bad debt. 32. In terms of recourse debt factoring arrangements when a debt is sold by the Assignor on a recourse basis, the title to the debt passes to the Factor unless the Factor exercises a recourse option or right by which the debt can be transferred back to the Assignor. Therefore, until the recourse is exercised and the debt is transferred back, a bad debt deduction is not available under s 26(1), as after the sale there is no debt owed to the Assignor. 33. However, if the Factor exercises an option or right to transfer some portion of the debt back to the Assignor after the sale then, once this has occurred, a debt exists that is owed to the Assignor that may be able to be written off by the Assignor. Under s 26(1AA), s 26(1) applies if a registered person sells a debt and then reacquires it. Whether it can be written off depends on the application of the tests for determining whether a debt is bad in BR Pub 18/07. The debt must be “bad” 34. When assessing whether a bad debt exists, BR Pub 18/07 indicates that a debt is bad when a reasonably prudent commercial person would have concluded, based on the information available about the debtor’s ability to repay the debt, that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. In the absence of such a circumstance, if a registered person chooses to sell a debt for below its face value, no bad debt exists and no deduction is available under s 20(3)i). The debt must be “written off” 35. BR Pub 18/07 establishes that, to write-off a debt as bad under s 26(1), reasonable steps must be taken to determine whether that particular debt owed by that particular debtor is likely to be paid (Case P53 (1992) 14 NZTC 4370 and Budget Rent A Car v C of IR (1995) 17 NZTC 12263). 36. Writing-off a portion of debt on this basis involves seeking a deduction for the provision for doubtful debts. As noted in BR Pub 18/07, the GSTA does not allow a deduction for the provision for doubtful debts. BR Pub 21/03 | 17 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Writing off the debt before sale to the Factor 37. In the past we have received submissions which noted that the issue of whether the discount to the Factor might be written off as a bad debt under s 26(1) would not arise if this amount were written off prior to the sale of the debt to the Factor. 38. The Commissioner agrees that this is the case. If a portion of a debt is written off before it is sold to the Factor, then whether the debt is written off as bad according to the requirements in s 26(1) depends on the application of the tests outlined in Public Ruling BR Pub 18/07. 39. This could happen where the registered person sells its bad debts to a Factor whose core business is to purchase bad debts in bulk from various vendors for a small fraction of the bad debts’ face value. This is beneficial to both the Assignor, who is able to recover some money for the debt, and the Factor, who has the advantage of economies of scale to recover the debts that would otherwise be irrecoverable. 40. In these circumstances, the sale of the debt to the Factor will give rise to a full or partial recovery of the amount written off, and output tax will be payable by the Assignor on the portion of the debt recovered in the period when the amount is recovered under s 26(2). Conclusion 41. In conclusion, the Commissioner considers that the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor cannot be an amount written off as a bad debt under s 26. Rather than being a bad debt, the discount from face value is simply a result of the process of agreeing the consideration for the debt that is acceptable to both the Assignor and the Factor. The reasons for this view are:  Cases considering the meaning of bad debt focus on whether the creditor can recover the outstanding amounts owing. That is, a bad debt arises when the creditor is unable or unlikely to recover the debt owing. If the creditor could recover the full amount owing but chooses not to (as in a debt factoring situation), any “loss” suffered by the creditor is not due to a bad debt.  Cases also indicate that for an amount to be written off as a bad debt, a debt must exist at the time the debt is written off. If a registered person factors a debt, no further debt exists between the registered person and debtor, and no amount can be written off as a bad debt. However, if a debt has been sold and then reacquired, an input tax deduction may be available if the tests in BR Pub 18/07 are subsequently met. BR Pub 21/03 | 17 June 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Examples 42. The following example illustrates the consequence of this ruling. Example 1 – Invoice basis VendorIn Co accounts for GST on an invoice basis. It sells 100 widgets to its customers for $100 on a buy now, pay later basis, and pays output tax for the sale of the widgets. VendorIn Co sells the debts relating to the sale of the widgets to Factor Co for $80. The sale of the debts to Factor Co is considered a “financial service” under s 3(1)(c) and it is, therefore, an exempt supply under s 14(1). At the time VendorIn Co sells the debts to Factor Co those debts were not “bad”. As such Vendor Co is not entitled to an input tax deduction under ss 26 and 20(3)(i). Example 2 – Payments basis VendorPay Co accounts for GST on a payments basis. It sells 100 widgets to its customers for $100 on a buy now, pay later basis. VendorPay Co has no output tax on the sale of the 100 widgets because it has not received a payment for the sale. VendorPay Co sells the debts relating to the sale of the widgets to Factor Co for $80. The sale of the debts to Factor Co is excluded from being a “financial service” under s 3(4)(a). Therefore, VendorPay Co is required to pay output tax on the $80 received from Factor Co. Further, s 26A requires VendorPay Co to account for output tax on the remaining book value of the debt of $20. Consequently, VendorPay Co is required to pay output tax on the full value of the debt of $100 at the time it sells its debts to Factor Co. At the time VendorPay Co sells the debts to Factor Co those debts were not “bad”. As such VendorPay Co is not entitled to an input tax deduction under ss 26 and 20(3)(i). Legislation 43.

Public Rulings set out the Commissioner’s view on how tax laws apply to a specific set of facts – called an arrangement. Taxpayers whose circumstances match the arrangement described in a Public Ruling may apply the ruling but are not obliged to do so. Public Rulings are binding on the Commissioner. This means that if you are entitled to apply a Public Ruling and you have calculated your tax liability in accordance with the ruling, the Commissioner must accept that assessment. A Public Ruling applies only to the taxation laws and arrangement set out in the ruling, and only for the period specified in the ruling. It is important to note that a general similarity between a taxpayer’s circumstances and the arrangement covered by a Public Ruling will not necessarily lead to the same tax result.

Goods and Services Tax – Payments made by parents to state and state integrated schools
=======================================================================================

GST is not chargeable on payments made by parents to the board of trustees of a state or state integrated school where the payments are made to assist the school with the cost of delivering education services which the student has a statutory entitlement to receive free of charge.

GST is chargeable on payments made for supplies of other goods or services that are not integral to the supply of education to which the student has a statutory entitlement, where that supply is conditional on the payment being made. This Ruling is a reissue of [BR Pub 18/06](/rulings/public/br-pub-1806-goods-and-services-tax-payments-made-by-parents-to-state-and-state-integrated-schools)
 which expired on 20 June 2023. It is substantially the same as BR Pub 18/06 but has been updated to reference the new Education and Training Act 2020 and the Ministry of Education’s revised Education Circular 2021/03.

PUBLIC RULING | WHAKATAUNGA TŪMATANUI Investing into a US limited liability company – New Zealand tax consequences Issued | Tukuna: 24 July 2023 BR Pub 23/09 – 23/13 T hese five Public Rulings and the accompanying commentary set out the income tax treatment and availability of foreign tax credits or other forms of double taxation relief for New Zealand investors in a United States limited liability company (US LLC) that is taxed on a fiscally transparent basis as a partnership in the US, but as a foreign company in New Zealand. The Rulings demonstrate the respective tax treatments where the interest in the US LLC is classified as under the foreign investment fund (FIF) threshold, a FIF or a controlled foreign company (CFC); where different FIF methods are used and where there is a non- attributing active FIF or CFC. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated.

How the taxation laws apply to the Arrangement | Ko te pānga o ngā ture tāke ki te Whakaritenga The taxation laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: The New Zealand investor will be subject to New Zealand tax on the attribute d i ncome from their interest in the FIF under ss CQ 4, CQ 5, CQ 6, EX 44(1)(b) and EX 50. \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 10 of 64 US federal income tax paid for the New Zealand investor on their partnership i ncome is creditable against the New Zealand investor’s FIF attributed income tax liability under s LK 1(1)(d). However, this is only to the extent that it does no t ex ceed the New Zealand tax payable on the FIF attributed income and the tax credit only relates to foreign tax paid in relation to income that is attributed FIF income. The distribution from the US LLC to the New Zealand investor will be a dividend and therefore income under s CD 1. Where the New Zealand investor is a company, any dividends it derives from a f oreign company are exempt income under s CW 9 unless subs (2) or (3) o f s CW 9 applies. Where the New Zealand investor is a natural person, they may reduce their dividend income under s CD 1 by the amount of the US federal income tax paid on their partnership income under s CD 18. The amount of the reduction is calculated using the formula in s CD 18(2).

This depends on whether the US LLC is a foreign investment fund (FIF) or a controlled foreign company (CFC), and if t he US LLC pays a dividend to the New Zealand investor. 2.By way of background, a US LLC is a hybrid entity 1 formed in the US that has company and partnership characteristics. A US LLC is a company that members form to hol d bus iness assets and conduct a specific business, and provides limited liability to its members. These Rulings focus on US LLCs that are treated as a partnership, where its members are taxed as partners for US federal income tax purposes. 3.For New Zealand tax purposes, a US LLC is a company and is a separate legal entity from its members. As a US LLC owns the business assets and conducts the specific business, the US LLC is treated as deriving the income that it earns from the conduct of that business for New Zealand tax purposes. Although a US LLC has partnershi p 1 US LLCs do not satisfy the definition of a “hybrid entity” for the purposes of the hybrid mismatch rules in subpart FH. While US LLCs may be reverse hybrid entities, the provisions in subpart FH are not expressly relevant in the context of the Rulings. BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 19 of 64 characteristics, a US LLC does not meet the New Zealand legal requirements for being taxed as a partnership. 4.The Rulings set out that the income tax treatment for a New Zealand investor in a US LLC can vary d epending on who holds the interest, whether the New Zealand investor’s FIF interests are under the FIF threshold, the choice of calculation method, and whether the US LLC is classified as a FIF, a CFC, or a non-attributing active FIF or CFC. 5.A New Zealand investor is entitled to claim a New Zealand FTC for US federal income ta x they pay and/or “relief” in terms of s CD 18, s EX 51, subpart LK or subpart OE in the three circumstances set out in the Rulings. 6.The first circumstance is where the US LLC is a CFC or a FIF (where the investor chooses to adopt the attributable FIF income method) and the New Zealand investor has attributed CFC or FIF income. The New Zealand investor may claim an FTC under subpart LK for any US federal income tax they pay on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income against their New Zealand tax liability on attributed CFC or FIF income. Where the New Zealand investor is an individual, they may also claim a branch eq uivalent tax account (BETA) tax credit under subpart OE (for New Zealand tax paid on attributed CFC or FIF income) against their tax liability on dividend income. 7.The second circumstance is where the New Zealand investor derives a dividend from the US LLC. The New Zealand investor may reduce the amount of the dividend by any US federal income tax they paid on their distributive share of the US LLC’s incom e und er s CD 18. The New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand tax on t he r educed dividend amount. Where the New Zealand investor is not subject to New Zealand tax on the dividend from the US LLC, the relief under CD 18 does not apply because the dividend is not taxable. This will be the case if the New Zealand investor is a company and the foreign dividends it derives are exempt income under s CW 9 (provided subss (2) and (3) of s CW 9 do not apply), and where the New Zealand investor chooses to adopt one of the following FIF income calculation methods: fair dividend rate, comparative value, cost method or deemed rate of return. 8.The third circumstance is where the New Zealand investor chooses to adopt the comparative value method for their FIF income and includes US federal income tax paid on their distributive share of US LLC income as a cost, a gain, and a reduction of the closing value in the formula in s EX 51(1). 9.A New Zealand investor may also be entitled to relief under the Double Taxation Relief (United States of America) Order 1983 (NZ–US DTA). However, under the specific facts of the arrangements these Rulings cover, the articles in the NZ–US DTA dealing specifically with relief from double taxation do not apply to provide any relief for dividend income derived from a US LLC. For completeness, we note the NZ–US DTA BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 20 of 64 does not impact on the circumstances for which relief is available under s CD 18, s EX 51, subpart LK or subpart OE in the three circumstances discussed at \[6\] to \[8\]. 10.The Rulings outline when t ax relief is available to individual investors under s CD 18 and subpart OE (as discussed at \[6\] and \[7\]). While this relief may also apply to other investors that are not companies or individuals, the Rulings and commentary do not specifically consider how the taxation laws could apply to such persons.

It also includes tables setting out the tax treatment for FIFs and CFCs. BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 21 of 64 What is a US LLC? 14.A US LLC is a hybrid legal entity that is a limited liability company but also has characteristics of a partnership. 2 US LLCs are established at the state level under local state law but are similar in structure across the US. 15.US LLCs have four common features: 15.1The US LLC is a separate legal entity from its members. 15.2The US LLC, not its members, conducts the business of the US LLC. 15.3The US LLC, not its members, owns the assets used for carrying on the business of the US LLC. 15.4The US LLC is liable for the debts incurred as a result of carrying on the US LLC’s business. The members have no liability for the liabilities of the US LLC. 16.The operations of a US L LC are generally governed by an operating agreement. Most operating agreements include an explanation of: 16.1each member’s percentage interest in the US LLC represented by their capital account; 16.2the members’ rights and responsibilities; 16.3how the US LLC will be managed; 16.4dissolution procedures; 16.5how profits and losses for financial accounting and tax are to be allocated to each member; and 16.6rules governing what distribution of a member’s share of the US LLC’s profits is to be made in a particular year. 2 US LLCs with two or more members are taxed as partnerships by default unless they elect to be taxed as a corporation. When a US LLC is treated as a partnership, the members are taxed as partners for federal income tax purposes. The allocation of profits or losses of a US LLC must be made in accordance with the US LLC’s limited liability agreement (also known as the US LLC’s operating agreement). See, for example, § 18-503 of the 2014 Delaware Code. The approach to allocating the US LLC’s profits to its members and crediting profits to their capital account is similar to how profits are allocated and accounted for in a partnership. Single-member US LLCs are also taxed on a flow through basis to that member. While the Rulings do not apply to single-member US LLCs, the discussion in this Commentary on the tax outcomes arising could also apply in certain circumstances to single-member LLCs that do not elect to be taxed as a corporation and are taxed with a flow-through treatment. Different outcomes may arise, for example, if the US LLC’s operating agreement contains terms that impact the timing of income derivation. BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 22 of 64 17.A US LLC is managed by its members or a manager. A manager may be a group of members (Managing Members) or a third party. 18.Ownership in a US LLC is represented by a membership interest rather than by shares. For this reason, a US LLC’s owners are referred to as members rather tha n s hareholders. 19.Generally, profits are allocated to members in proportion to their membership interests as reflected in their capital accounts. However, the operating agreement may specify profit interests for members that are not based on their capital accounts. This mirro rs pa rtnerships that may include differential profit-sharing arrangements for members to reflect risk and reward. 20.The distributive share of the US LLC’s income on which a member pays US tax is their share of the profits as determined by the operating agreement, adjusted, as necessary, to meet the US tax requirements. As such, it may differ from a proportional share of the net accounting income or the specified profit share, as the case may be. 21.A member’s capital account is essentially a measure of a member’s equity in a US LLC. It is generally added to by contributions the member has made and by the member’s share of profits. The capital account is debited by any share of loss and by any distributions taken by the member. 22.For US federal income tax purposes, a US LLC with multiple members is treated and taxed as a partnership unless it elects to be taxed as a corporation. 3 Each member of a US LLC pays tax on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income, which they report on their individual US federal income tax return. 4 The US LLC files a federal partnership r eturn, and the individual member must include their distributive share in their personal federal income tax return. 5 23.A US LLC is required to withhold and pay tax from US-sourced profits allocated to non- resident members on the members’ behalf. Different rates apply depending on t he in come category but commonly 30% applies. Since a member has already paid tax o n t heir share of the US LLC’s taxable income, the member generally pays no further US tax when the US LLC distributes that income to them. However, further US tax would be payable if, for example, the member was distributed an amount in excess of their 3 Taxation of Limited Liability Companies (Publication 3402, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, 2016) provides that a US LLC with at least two members is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. 4 The US Internal Revenue Code, § 701, states that partners, not the partnership, are liable for tax. Each member must file an annual federal income tax return. 5 As the US LLC is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, the US LLC must file a federal partnership return reporting the taxable income of the partnership computed in terms of § 703 of the Internal Revenue Code (US). However, it is the partners, not the partnership, who are liable for income tax: § 701 of the Internal Revenue Code (US). BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 23 of 64 capital account. When a member files their US tax return they may receive a refund of US tax, for example, if the NZ-US DTA reduces the applicable rate on the type of income from that withheld and paid by the US LLC on behalf of the investor. Characteristics of a US LLC that make it a company for New Zealand tax purposes 24.The word “company” is defined in s YA 1. Company (in part): YA 1 Definitions In this Act, unless the context requires otherwise,— ... company— (a)means a body corporate or other entity that has a legal existence separate from that of its members, whether it is incorporated or created in New Zealand or elsewhere: (ab) does not include a partnership: 25.In S Watson and L Taylor (eds), Corporate Law in New Zealand (online ed, Thomson R euters, 2019), the authors note the attributes of the modern New Zealand company i n t he following terms (at \[16.1.2\]): As a species of corporation, the modern company has the following traditional and modern corporate attributes: (1)It has perpetual succession. Until dissolved, a company continues to exist and survives the death of its directors and shareholders. (2)It owns its property. The assets of a company do not belong to the shareholders. The only interest which they have in the assets of the company is indirectly through the medium of their shares. They have no proprietary rights to the underlying assets. Similarly, creditors of the company are not creditors of the shareholders. The creditors must claim against the company, and it is only if the company is in liquidation and there is some evidence of use of the corporat e f orm to evade obligations that claimants may possibly have recourse against the shareholders. (3)As a separate legal person, the company can transact and can sue or be sued in its own name. (4)The liability of the shareholders of a limited company is usually limited. Shareholders are only liable for the amount unpaid on their shares. (5)As a consequence of limited liability, the capital of the company is locked in creating entity partitioning or strong form entity shielding . BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 24 of 64 (6)As the price of incorporation, the company must comply with the formalities of the Act. This requires payment of the registration fee, and the regular filing o f d ocuments and accounts with the Registrar of Companies. These are the costs of transacting business in this particular way. 26.A US LLC meets the definition of a company for New Zealand company and tax law purposes for six main reasons: 26.1A US LLC is a legal entity that comes into existence by the execution of a certificate of formation. 6 It remains in existence until it is dissolved. 26.2The assets used for carrying on the business of the US LLC belong to the US LLC, not its members. 7 26.3The US LLC (not the members) is liable for the debts incurred as a result of carrying on the US LLC’s business. The members have no liability for the liabilities of the US LLC. 26.4The liability of a member of a US LLC is limited to their capital contributions as defined in the US LLC’s operating agreement or, where there is no operating agreement, under state law. 8 26.5A US LLC’s operating agreement generally specifies how a US LLC will be dissolved and how assets will be allocated to members. In a US LLC, initial capital and retained profits are largely locked in. 26.6Fees and formalities need to be paid and satisfied to create a US LLC in the US. 27.Alternatively, a US LLC could be an “other entity that has a legal existence separate f rom that of its members, whether incorporated or created in New Zealand or elsewhere” (s YA 1). 28.A US LLC is an entity that has a separate legal existence from its members and is incorporated or created in the US. 6 For example, § 18-201 of the Limited Liability Company Act (Delaware) provides that a company formed under that Act is a separate legal entity until the cancellation of the company’s certificate of formation. 7 For example, § 18-701 of the Limited Liability Company Act (Delaware) provides that members have no interest in specific property of the LLC. 8 For example, § 18-502 of the Limited Liability Act (Delaware) states that a member is obligated to an LLC to make their promised cash, property or service contributions. BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 25 of 64 Why a US LLC is not a partnership for New Zealand tax purposes 29.Section YA 1 provides that a company does not include a partnership. 30.A “partnership” is defined in s YA 1 to mean a group of 2 or more persons who have bet ween themselves the relationship described in s 8 (1) of the Partnership Law Act 2019. Section 8 of the Partnership Law Act 2019 defines a partnership as t he r elationship that “exists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view to profit”. 31.A US LLC is not a partnership for New Zealand tax purposes because it is the US LLC that carries on the business, not the members of the US LLC. Why a US LLC is treated for New Zealand tax purposes as deriving the income it earns from the conduct of the US LLC’s business 32.A company is a separate legal entity and, for New Zealand tax purposes, is a separate ta xpayer from its shareholders. Where a taxpayer owns business assets and carries on a business, then the income from that business is derived by that taxpayer. Section CB 1 states that “an amount that a person derives from a business is income of the person”. 33.Although in the context of the Rulings, the US LLC is not a New Zealand taxpayer, the s cheme of the Act, as far as business owners are concerned, applies to a US LLC. For this reason, for New Zealand tax purposes a US LLC that is a separate legal entity and owns the assets and conducts the business of the US LLC, will be treated as deriving any income it earns from the business activities it conducts (that is, the income will not be treated as derived by the members of the US LLC). 34.Consequently, a New Zealand investor in a US LLC will be subject to New Zealand tax on dividends derived from the US LLC and/or any FIF income or attributed CFC income, where the US LLC is a FIF or a CFC. The New Zealand income tax consequences for a New Zealand investor in a US LLC are discussed next. BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 26 of 64 How a New Zealand resident investor is taxed on income derived from a US LLC 35.A New Zealand investor in a US LLC may be subject to New Zealand tax on dividends derived from the US LLC and/or any FIF income or attributed CFC income, where th e US L LC is a FIF or a CF C. 36.In the following paragraphs, we discuss: 36.1what a dividend is for New Zealand tax purposes (from \[37\]); 36.2when a dividend is derived for New Zealand tax purposes (from \[42\]); 36.3what a dividend is in the US LLC context (from \[44\]); 36.4how the FIF regime applies to investments in a US LLC (from \[53\]); and 36.5how the CFC regime applies to investments in a US LLC (from \[80\]). What a dividend is for New Zealand tax purposes 37.Section CD 1 (1) states that a “dividend derived by a person is income of the person”. Section CD 3 provides that ss CD 4 to CD 20 define what a dividend is. 38.Section CD 4(1) provides: CD 4 Transfers of company value generally Transfers of company value from company (1)A transfer of company value from a company to a person is a dividend if— (a)the cause of the transfer is a shareholding in the company, as described in section CD 6; and (b)none of the exclusions in sections CD 22 to CD 37 applies to the transfer. 39.Section CD 5(1) provides: BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 27 of 64 CD 5 What is a transfer of company value? General test (1)A transfer of company value from a company to a person occurs when— (a)the company provides money or money’s worth to the person; and (b)if the person provides any money or money’s worth to the company under the same arrangement, the market value of what the company provides is more than the market value of what the person provides. 40.Section CD 6(1) expands on s CD 5(1): CD 6 When is a transfer caused by a shareholding relationship? General test (1)A transfer of company value from a company to a person (the recipient) is caused by a shareholding in the company if— (a)the recipient at any relevant time— (i)holds shares in the company; or (ii)is associated with a shareholder; and (iii)\[Repealed\] (b)the company makes the transfer because of that shareholding of the relevant shareholder. 41.In summary, a dividend is a transfer of company value (the provision of money or money’s worth) to a person from a company where that transfer in value is because of that person’s shareholding (for example, the payment of a dividend to a shareholder i n a publicly held company). When a dividend is derived for New Zealand tax purposes 42.A dividend is not income of a person unless it is also derived by that person for New Zealand tax purposes. A dividend is derived when the income is credited to a t axpayer’s account or in some other way dealt with in their interest or on their behalf, regardless of whether the New Zealand investor is a cash-basis or an accruals-basi s ta xpayer, even if it is not treated as derived by them under common law: s BD 3(4). 43.The arrangements to which these Rulings apply assume that the only dividends derived from a US LLC are cash dividends (a dividend other than a non-cash dividend). Section CD 1(2) confirms that income from cash dividends is allocated to the income BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 28 of 64 year it is received. This includes where the dividend is credited to the balance of the person’s current or other account with the entity. What a dividend is in the US LLC context 44.A US LLC’s operating agreement will specify how the annual net accounting profits or losses of the US LLC are allocated to its members and any profit-sharing arrangements that depart from a member’s percentage ownership interest. 9 Generally, a proportional share of net profits or losses or the specified profit share are credited or debited to a member’s capital account, and any subsequent distribution is debited to the member’s capital account. 45.A US LLC’s operating agreement will also contain rules for when amounts in a member’s capital account will be distributed or held in reserve to meet expected or contingent liabilities. 46.The allocation and crediting to a member’s capital account of the member’s share of the US LLC’s profits is a “dividend” as defined in ss CD 4 and CD 5 for New Zealand tax purposes, as it is a transfer of value (the provision of money or money’s worth) by t he US L LC to a member and the cause of transfer is the member’s “shareholding” in t he US L LC. 47.A dividend will be derived by a member when the member has a right to access their share of profits credited to their capital account. This will commonly coincide with t he M anaging Members of the US LLC (or another person authorised to make that decision) resolving to distribute funds to a member and when the funds are placed outside the control of the Managing Members. 48.The time when funds are placed outside the control of the Managing Members depends on the rules relating to distributions in a particular US LLC’s operating agreement. For example, where distributions to a member from the member’s capital account are at the sole discretion of the Managing Members (or those authorised to make the decision), then the dividend will be derived by a member at the time t he Managing Members resolve to make a distribution to a member and the member can a ccess the funds. In these circumstances, the Managing Members have formally parted with control of the funds, and the member can access those funds as they wish. 49.The timing is different where a member of a US LLC is able to withdraw their share of the US LLC’s profits from their capital account (subject to cash being available) becaus e 9 Where there is no term in the operating agreement or no operating agreement exists, then, generally, the US state law on which the US LLC was created will contain a default rule for the allocation of accounting profits or losses to its members. For example, § 18-503 of the 2014 Delaware Code provides that in the absence of a term in the operating agreement, profits or losses should be allocated on the basis of the agreed value of the contributions made by each member. BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 29 of 64 the US LLC’s operating agreement provides for mandatory distributions. In this case, the member will derive the dividend for New Zealand tax purposes at the time of crediting to their capital account. Example 2 and Example 3 (following \[136\]) explain the practical effects of this difference. 50.The Commissioner’s approach is consistent with the High Court decision in CI R v A lbany Food Warehouse (2009) 24 NZTC 23,532. The court in Albany was required to consider when amounts credited to a shareholder’s current account should be treated as paid to them for New Zealand tax purposes. The court concluded the amount was paid if it was placed outside the directors’ control as a result of the directors’ resolutio n d eclaring the dividend and crediting the dividend to the shareholder’s current account. The court distinguished the facts of Albany from those in Alliance Group Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,066, where the High Court had concluded that a payment had no t ha ppened at the time of crediting to the account of the taxpayer, because the taxpayer did not have the right to draw on the funds in the account. 51.The Rulings assume that distributions from a member’s capital account are at the sole d iscretion of the Managing Members, and that a member will be able to access funds in their capital account only once the Managing Members have resolved to distribut e t he funds. In such circumstances, a dividend will be derived for New Zealand tax purposes by a member at the time of distribution to that member. 52.The circumstances, and how a dividend derived by a New Zealand investor in a US LLC will be taxed, depends also on whether the US LLC is a FIF or a CFC. The application of the FIF and CFC rules, New Zealand’s FTC rules and s CD 18 are discussed next. How the FIF regime applies to investments in a US LLC 53.An investment in a US LLC by a New Zealand investor will be an investment in a FIF (unless it is a CFC in which the investor’s income interest is 10% or more) and the FIF rules will apply. 54.Section EX 28 defines a FIF as including a “foreign company”. As discussed at \[24\], s YA 1 defines a “company” to include a body corporate or other entity that has a legal existence separate from its members, whether incorporated or created in New Zealand or elsewhere. Section YA 1 in turn defines a “foreign company” as a company that is not resident in New Zealand. A US LLC is a company for New Zealand tax purposes, and it is assumed that for the purposes of these Rulings the US LLC is not tax residen t i n New Zealand. 55.A New Zealand investor in a US LLC that is a FIF will be subject to tax on FIF income if they hold an “attributing interest” in the FIF as described in s EX 29 and none of the FIF exemptions in ss EX 31 to EX 43 applies. One category of attributing interest that is relevant to an interest in a US LLC is a direct income interest as described in s EX 30(1): BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 30 of 64 EX 30 Direct income interests in FIFs Categories of direct income interest (1)A person has a direct income interest in a foreign company at any time if they hold— (a)any of the shares in the foreign company: (b)any of the shareholder decision-making rights for the company: (c)a right to receive, or to apply, any of the income of the company for the accounting period in which the time falls: (d)a right to receive, or to apply, any of the value of the net assets of the company, if they are distributed. 56.Shares in a foreign company are a direct income interest: s EX 30(1)(a). A “share” is d efined in s YA 1 to “include any interest in the capital of a company”. A member’s ownership in a US LLC is represented by their membership interest in the LLC (generally in proportion to their capital contributions to the LLC) rather than shares. A member’s capital account generally includes initial capital, any additional capital and the allocation of the net accounting profits or losses of the US LLC to its members less distributions made. A member’s interest of a US L LC in their capital account is considered an “interest in the capital of the company” and is a “share” for New Zealand tax purposes. 57.A right to receive, or to apply, any of the income of a foreign company for an a ccounting period in which the time falls is also a direct income interest: s EX 30(1)(c). A US LLC operating agreement may specify a profit interest of each member. In thes e c ircumstances, the percentage of a US LLC’s profits allocated to a member’s capita l a ccount is based on the profit interest specified in the operating agreement rather than based on the member’s capital interest that is reflected by their capital account balance relative to the total capital of the US LLC. A member’s profit interest in a US LLC is considered a “right to receive, or to apply, any of the income of a foreig n c ompany for an accounting period in which the time falls” for New Zealand tax purposes. 58.In summary, a member’s interest or profit interest in a US LLC can be a direct income i nterest, so is an attributing interest in a FIF. In these circumstances, a New Zealand investor who is a member of a US LLC will be subject to tax on FIF income (subject to exemptions). It is assumed for the purposes of the Rulings that none of the FIF exemptions in ss EX 31 to EX 43 applies ( unless it is a CFC in which the investor’s income interest is 10% or more, where the CFC rules will apply instead). Similarly, it is assumed that the member is not a transitional resident who is not taxed i n N ew Zealand on certain foreign-sourced income. 59.The FIF rules apply to the following arrangements, as set out in the Rulings. BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 31 of 64 Where total cost of the investor’s interests in FIFs is $50,000 or less 60.A natural person and trustees for a limited variety of trusts holding an interest in a FIF w ill not have FIF income if the cost of the FIF interests they hold does not exceed $50,000 at any time in a year: s CQ 5(1)(d) and (e) respectively. 10 This assumes the per son has not opted to include FIF income despite their FIF interests being less tha n t he threshold. The New Zealand investor will be taxed on only the actual dividends derived from the US LLC (and from any other FIF interests they hold) and does not have FIF income under s CQ 5(1) where the circumstances in s CQ 5(1)(d) and (e) do not apply. 61.Section CD 18 applies to reduce the amount of a dividend derived from the US LLC to take into account US federal income tax paid by the New Zealand investor. T he a mount of the reduction is calculated using the formula in s CD 18(2). This formula requires factoring in any prior reductions to other dividends for US federal tax in accordance with s CD 18 since inception of the investment in the US LLC. This is explained in more detail from \[111\]. 62.No FTCs are available to be claimed against the New Zealand tax on any dividend d erived from the US LLC because no US tax is paid at source on the distributions. 63.A New Zealand investor cannot claim a New Zealand FTC (under ss LJ 1(1) and LJ 2(1) or the NZ–US DTA) for US federal income tax on “partnership” income against their New Zealand tax liability on dividend income derived from the US LLC. This is becaus e t he US federal income tax paid on the New Zealand investor’s distributive share is not paid on the dividend distribution from the US LLC. However, the s CD 18 reduction has a similar overall effect, albeit as a different way of recognising the US tax paid by t he N ew Zealand investor. Example 2 and Example 3 ( following \[ 136\]) illustrate how this works in practice. Where the US LLC is a FIF and the FIF income is calculated by applying the fair dividend rate, comparative value, cost method or deemed rate of return 64.Where the $50,000 FIF “exemption” does not apply, a New Zealand investor who has an attributing interest must pay New Zealand tax on their FIF income. Subject to any 10 If the person is a trustee, they must also meet the requirements of s CQ 5(5), which broadly restrict eligibility to testamentary trusts of a person within 5 years of death, certain court-ordered trusts and trusts settled by the Accident Compensation Corporation. BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 32 of 64 limitations under s EX 44(2), a New Zealand investor may choose one of the following five methods for calculating FIF income: 11 64.1fair dividend rate (FDR); 64.2comparative value (CV); 64.3cost method (CM); 64.4deemed rate of return (DRR); and 64.5attributable FIF income method (AFIM – covered in the next section). 65.Where a New Zealand investor in a US LLC chooses to adopt the FDR, CV, CM or DRR FI F income calculation methods, the resulting amount from applying that method is FIF income. Any FIF income calculated under the FDR, CV, CM or DRR calculation methods is a substitute for any actual income derived by a New Zealand investor in the FIF. To avoid double taxation, any actual income derived by a New Zealand investor from a FIF (for example, dividends) who chooses to adopt the FDR, CV, CM or DRR calculation method is excluded income under ss EX 59(2) and CX 57B (that is, it is not assessable income). 66.Additionally, s CD 36 provides that where a person adopts the FDR, CV, CM or DRR calculation method, any actual dividends derived from the FIF are “not a dividend”. Section CD 36(1) state s: CD 36 Foreign investment fund income Amount not dividend (1)An amount paid by a company to a person is not a dividend if, — (a)at the time the person derives the amount, the person’s interest in the company is an attributing interest, or would have been if the company had not been liquidated; and (b)the person calculates their foreign investment fund (FIF) income or loss in relation to the interest and the period in which the amount is paid under— (i)the comparative value method: (ii)the deemed rate of return method: (iii)the cost method: (iv)the fair dividend rate method; and 11 The Rulings do not consider the branch equivalent and accounting profits method that were available for use for income years beginning on or before 30 June 2011. In choosing a calculation method, New Zealand investors should also consider any data requirements for the calculation, including practicalities around determining the market value of their interests. BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 33 of 64 (c)\[Repealed\] (d)the amount is excluded income under section CX 57B (Amounts derived during periods covered by calculation methods). 67.As s CD 36 excludes an amount derived from a foreign company from being a dividend, s CD 18 does not apply to a New Zealand investor in a FIF who adopts t he FD R, CV, CM or DRR calculation method. Section CD 18 provides relief for New Zealand investors in foreign hybrid entities by allowing the amount of a dividen d t o be reduced for foreign tax paid; s CD 18 cannot apply if there is no dividend (whic h i s the effect of s CD 36). 68.Also, a New Zealand investor cannot claim a New Zealand FTC (under subpart LJ or the NZ– US DTA) for US federal income tax on their distributive share against their New Zealand tax liability on FIF income. This is because the US federal income tax paid on the New Zealand investor’s distributive share is not foreign tax paid on FIF income. 69.For a detailed example, see Example 4 ( following \[136\]). 70.However, relief is available for US federal income tax paid on a New Zealand investor’s distributive share if that investor has chosen to adopt the CV method to calculate their FIF income. Section EX 51(1) provides a formula for calculating CV income. A New Zealand investor may deduct US federal income tax paid in the income year on t he pa rtnership income as a “cost” under s EX 51(6)(b), when calculating their FIF incom e under the formula in s EX 51(1). The amount is also a “gain” under s EX 51(4) and a reduction in the “closing value” under s EX 51(3) in the formula. The overall net result is a reduction in FIF income as calculated under s EX 51(1) by the amount of the US federal income tax paid. Where the US LLC is a FIF and the investor adopts the AFIM 71.In general terms, a New Zealand investor in a FIF may choose to adopt the AFIM for calculating their FIF income, provided the New Zealand investor can give t he C ommissioner (if requested) sufficient information to enable the Commissioner to check the calculations required by s EX 50; and where: 71.1 the FIF is a foreign company and the New Zealand investor: 71.1.1 has an income interest of 10% or more in the FIF; and 71.1.2 is not a portfolio investment entity; or 71.2 the FIF is a CFC that does not have a readily available market value except one calculated by independent valuation and certain other conditions apply: s EX 46(3)(b). BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 34 of 64 72.A New Zealand investor will, generally, be subject to tax on any dividends derived from the FIF, and any FIF income calculated by applying the AFIM ( unless it is a non- attributing active FIF as discussed below). 73.The New Zealand investor is taxed on their share of the FIF’s income under ss CQ 4, CQ 5, CQ 6, EX 44(1)(b) and EX 50. 74.US federal income tax paid by the New Zealand investor on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income is creditable against the New Z ealand investor’s income tax liability on attributed FIF income: s LK 1(1)(d). \[Note that this tax credit is only available to the extent it does not exceed the New Zealand tax payable on the FIF attributed income and it only relates to foreign tax paid in relation to income that is attributed FIF income.\] 75.A distribution from the US LLC is a dividend and will therefore be income under s CD 1 fo r New Zealand tax purposes. The New Zealand tax consequences of the dividend distribution are as follows: 75.1 Where the New Zealand investor is a company, any dividends derived by a company from a foreign company are exempt income under s CW 9 provided the exclusions in s CW 9(2) and (3) do not apply. No FTCs are claimable. 75.2 Where the New Zealand investor is an individual, they may reduce the amount of the dividend they derive from the US LLC by the amount of US federal income tax they paid on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income: s CD 18. The New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand tax on the reduced dividend. 75.3 An individual New Zealand investor may choose to be a branch equivalent tax account (BETA) person under s OE 1(2). If the individual investor has a net New Zealand tax liability on their attributed FIF income (after claiming FTC), then the individual investor can claim a BETA tax credit (for the New Zealand tax they have paid on their attributed FIF income) against the New Zealand tax liability on the reduced dividend (net of foreign tax paid through the application of s CD 18) under s OE 20. 76.For a detailed example, see Example 5 ( following \[ 136\]). Where the US LLC is a FIF that is a non-attributing active FIF 77.Where a New Zealand investor applies the AFIM, they may also apply the active bus iness exemption. In simple terms, a FIF will satisfy the active business exemptio n w here it has attributable income (income from “passive” sources) that is less than 5% of the FIF’s gross income. Where the active exemption applies, the New Zealand investor in the FIF is treated as having an exemption for holding a non-attributin g BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 35 of 64 active FIF interest: s CQ 5(1)(c)(xv). In these circumstances, an individual New Zealand investor will be taxed in New Zealand only on any dividend derived from the US LLC. The New Zealand investor may reduce the amount of the dividend derived from the US LLC by the amount of any US federal income tax paid on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income: s CD 18. The New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand tax on the reduced dividend. 78.On the other hand, a New Zealand company investor is not subject to New Zealand tax because dividends from a foreign company are exempt income under s CW 9, provided the exclusions in s CW 9(2) and (3) do not apply. 79.For a detailed example, see Example 7 ( following \[ 136\]). How the CFC regime applies to investments in a US LLC 80.A CFC is defined in the Act as a foreign company controlled by New Zealand residents. A US LLC is a company and will be a “foreign company”, provided it is not resident i n N ew Zealand. 81.The US LLC will be “controlled” by New Zealand residents if, for example, a group of five or fewer New Zealand residents has a total control interest of more than 50% i n a ny one of the control interest categories. 82.In general terms, a New Zealand investor will have attributed CFC income in a US LLC (which is a CFC) if they have an income interest in the CFC of 10% or more, the CFC has “net attributable CFC income”, and the CFC is not a non-attributing active CFC. Where the US LLC is a CFC 83.In summary, the New Zealand tax consequences for a US LLC that is a CFC are as f ollows (which are the same as the tax consequences for a New Zealand investor in a FIF where the investor chooses to adopt the AFIM): 83.1 The New Zealand investor pays New Zealand tax on their share of attributed CFC income under ss CQ 1 and CQ 2. 83.2 Any US federal income tax paid by the New Zealand investor on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income is creditable against their CFC attributed income tax liability: s LK 1(1)(d). Note that this tax credit is available only to the extent it does not exceed the New Zealand tax payable on the CFC attributed income and it only relates to foreign tax paid in relation to income that is attributed CFC income. BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 36 of 64 83.3 A distribution from the US LLC is a dividend and will therefore be income under s CD 1 for New Zealand tax purposes. The New Zealand tax consequences of the dividend distribution are as follows: 83.3.1 Where the New Zealand investor is a company, any dividends derived by the company from a foreign company are exempt income under s CW 9, provided the exclusions in s CW 9(2) and (3) do not apply. No FTCs are claimable. 83.3.2 Where the investor is an individual, they may reduce the amount of the dividend they derived from the US LLC by the amount of US federal income tax they paid on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income: s CD 18. The New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand tax on the reduced dividend. 83.3.3 An individual investor can choose to be a BETA person under s OE 1(2). If the individual investor has a net New Zealand tax liability on their attributed CFC income (after claiming FTC), then the individual investor can claim a BETA tax credit (for the New Zealand tax they have paid on their attributed CFC income) against the New Zealand tax liability on the reduced dividend (net of foreign tax paid through the application of s CD 18) under s OE 20. 84.For a detailed example, see Example 6 ( following \[ 136\]). Where the US LLC is a non-attributing active CFC 85.Where the US LLC is a non-attributing active CFC, then the tax consequences are the s ame as described at \[77\] to \[79\] for a non-attributing active FIF. 86.There is no attributed income from the CFC under s CQ 2(1)(h). 87.A dividend is income under s CD 1. A New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand tax only on dividends derived from the US LLC as follows: 87.1 Where the investor is a company, any dividends derived by the company from a foreign company are exempt income under s CW 9, provided the exclusions in s CW 9(2) and (3) do not apply. No FTCs are claimable. 87.2 Where the investor is an individual, they may reduce the amount of the dividend they derived from the US LLC by the amount of US federal income tax they paid on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income: s CD 18. The New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand tax on the reduced dividend. 88.For a detailed example, see Example 7 ( following \[136\]).

The additional FIF income or loss can aris e r egardless of whether or not the US LLC is a non-attributing active FIF or CFC. 90.The Rulings and commentary do not specifically consider the tax implications of any indirect FIF interests held by a New Zealand investor via their interest in a US LLC. This is because additional FIF income or loss may arise in respect of an indirect FIF interest regardless of whether the interest is held via a US LLC o r not. In other words, the tax implications of such indirect holdings in FIFs are not specific to the taxation of US LLCs and are out of scope of the Rulings and commentary. What foreign taxes a New Zealand investor pays in respect of a US LLC are creditable against their FIF income, CFC income or dividend tax liability 91.Several FTC provisions may apply to a New Zealand investor in a US LLC in this context: 91.1 Sections LJ 1(1) and LJ 2(1) set out the general rule for claiming an FTC where f oreign tax has been paid on a New Zealand investor’s foreign-sourced income, which is also subject to New Zealand tax. 91.2 Section LJ 2(6) and (7) sets out a special rule for claiming an FTC where the New Zealand investor adopts the FDR, CV, CM or DRR FIF income calculation method. A New Zealand investor may claim foreign tax paid on actual foreign-sourced dividends against the New Zealand tax liability on the FIF income they derived. 91.3 Section LK 1 sets out the FTC rules that apply to a New Zealand resident investor with attributed income from a CFC or a FIF where they have adopted the AFIM. Sections LJ 1(1) and LJ 2(1) – general rule 92.Sections LJ 1(1) and LJ 2(1) provide the general rule that a person is entitled to a tax credit for foreign tax paid against their New Zealand income tax liability in relation to foreign-sourced income. These sections also set out how to calculate the New Zealand tax applicable on that foreign-sourced income. BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 38 of 64 93.Section LJ 1(1) and (2)(a) provides: LJ 1 What this subpart does When tax credits allowed (1)This subpart provides the rules for dividing assessable income from foreign-sourced amounts into segments and allows a tax credit for foreign income tax paid in relation to a segment of that income. Limited application of rules (2)The rules in this subpart apply only when— (a)a person resident in New Zealand derives assessable income that is sourced from outside New Zealand;... \[Emphasis added\] 94.Section LJ 2(1) to (3) provides: LJ 2 Tax credits for foreign income tax Amount of credit (1)A person described in section LJ 1(2)(a) has a tax credit for a tax year for an amount of foreign income tax paid on a segment of foreign-sourced income, determined as if the segment were the net income of the person for the tax year. The amount of the New Zealand tax payable is calculated under section LJ 5. Limitation on amount of credit (2)The amount of the person’s credit in subsection (1) must not be more than the amount of New Zealand tax payable by the person in relation to the segment calculated under section LJ 5(2), modified as necessary under section LJ 5(4). Amount adjusted (3)The amount of the person’s credit in subsection (1) may be reduced or increased if either section LJ 6 or LJ 7 applies. \[Emphasis added\] 95.Section LJ 4 defines “segment of foreign-sourced income” as “a person has a segment of foreign-sourced income equal to an amount of assessable income derived from 1 foreign country that comes from 1 source or is of 1 nature” \[ original emphasis\]. For example, a dividend derived by a New Zealand investor from a US LLC would be a segment of foreign-sourced income (along with any other dividends derived from t he US) because it is an amount of assessable income they derived from one foreign c ountry (the US) that comes from one source (the US LLC) or is of one nature (a dividend). This is modified by s LJ 2(7) for FIF attributing interests, such that each FIF attributing interest is a separate segment of foreign-sourced income. This means FIF attributing interests from the same country are not aggregated and calculations must be done for each individual interest. BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 39 of 64 96.A New Zealand investor may claim an FTC against New Zealand tax payable on that foreign-sourced dividend, for an “amount of foreign tax paid” on that segment of foreign-sourced income. The FTC claimable by the New Zealand investor cannot exceed the New Zealand tax payable in relation to the foreign-sourced dividend: s LJ 2(2). 97.Section LJ 2(1) and (2) does not apply to the arrangements in the Rulings for two reasons. 98.The first reason is that no US tax is paid on the dividend distributions (segment of foreign-sourced income) that are taxed in New Zealand. 99.The second reason is that a New Zealand investor pays US federal income tax on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income. However, this cannot be claimed as an FTC against the New Zealand investor’s dividend income derived from the US LLC, becaus e th at foreign tax is not paid “on” that segment of foreign-sourced income under s LJ 2(1). In other words, as the New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income is not income derived for New Zealand tax purposes, there is no relevant segment of foreign-sourced income on which to claim an FTC in New Zealand. 100.We consider how the NZ–US DTA applies for US LLC investments from \[ 122\] to \[130\]. Article 22 of the NZ–US DTA operates in essentially the same way as ss LJ 1(1) and LJ 2(1) by permitting an FTC for foreign tax paid but only on the same income, for example, a foreign-sourced dividend taxed in New Zealand and in the US. Section LJ 2(6) and (7) – special rule 101.Section LJ 2(6) and (7) provides: When subsection (7) applies (6)Subsection (7) applies to a person who derives an amount from an attributing interest in a FIF when the amount is treated as not being income under section EX 59(2) (Codes: comparative value method, deemed rate of return method, fair dividend rate method, and cost method). Tax credit (7)The person has a tax credit under this subpart for foreign income tax paid on or withheld in relation to the amount. The calculation of the maximum amount of the tax credit is made under section LJ 5(2), modified so that the item segment in the formula is the amount of FIF income from the attributing interest that the person derives in the period referred to in section EX 59(2). 102.Any FIF income calculated under the FDR, CV, CM or DRR calculation method is a substitute for actual income derived by a New Zealand investor in the FIF. To avoid BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 40 of 64 double taxation, any actual income derived from a FIF by a New Zealand investor who has chosen to adopt the FDR, CV, CM or DRR calculation method is excluded income under ss EX 59(2) and CX 57B (that is, it is not assessable income). 103.Notwithstanding this “exemption”, the special rule in s LJ 2 (6) and (7) provides that any foreign tax paid on such actual income derived by a New Zealand investor may be c redited against their New Zealand tax liability on FIF income calculated under the FDR, CV, CM or DRR calculation method. For example, if a New Zealand investor derives a foreign-sourced amount that has been subject to foreign tax, then they can claim an FTC under s LJ 2(6) and (7) against their New Zealand tax liability on FIF income calculated under the FDR, CV, CM or DRR calculation method (but not exceeding t he N ew Zealand tax applicable on the FIF income: s LJ 2(2)). 104.However, s LJ 2(6) and (7) does not apply to the distributions from the US LLC in the c ontext of the arrangements in the Rulings, as no US tax is paid on the distributions from the US LLC that are dividends for New Zealand tax purposes. Section LJ 2(6) and (7) a lso does not apply in relation to any US federal income tax paid by a New Zealand investor in a US LLC on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income. That “partnership” income is not income derived by the New Zealand investor for New Zealand tax purposes. Subpart LK – CFC and FIF income 105.Where a person has attributed CFC income or applies the AFIM to their FIF interest, then that person is entitled to an FTC under s LK 1 against their New Zealand CFC o r F IF income tax liability. 106.Section LK 1(1) provides: LK 1 Tax credits relating to attributed CFC income When tax credits allowed (1)A person who has an amount of attributed CFC income for an income year has a tax credit for the tax year corresponding to the income year equal to the following amounts paid or payable in relation to the attributed CFC income: (a)an amount of income tax paid by the CFC from which the income is derived: (b)an amount of tax withheld and paid on behalf of the CFC from which the income is derived: (c)the amount of foreign income tax paid by the CFC from which the income is derived: (d)the amount of foreign income tax paid by the person in relation to the CFC from which the income is derived: BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 41 of 64 (e)the amount of foreign tax paid, under legislation of another country or territory that is equivalent of the international tax rules, by a foreign company in relation to income derived by the CFC. 107.Section LK 1(1) sets out the rules for claiming FTCs for foreign tax paid or payable by a CFC or a FIF (applying the AFIM), against a person’s New Zealand tax liability on attributed FIF or CFC income. Subpart LK is designed to accommodate timin g m ismatches that can routinely occur between different jurisdictions. Consequently, a per son in New Zealand can claim as a credit tax paid or payable in the US that relates to the CFC or FIF attributed income they derived, even if not paid in the relevant income year in New Zealand. 108.Section 93C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 assists if the amount of the credit c annot be determined before a return is filed. The Commissioner must amend a n a ssessment on request to reflect a credit if the request is made within 4 years from t he end of the relevant income year. It is not possible, however, to claim an FTC under s LK 1 if it relates to attributed income in a different income year. That is, FTCs can only be applied against the person’s income tax liability for the same tax year. Any FTC claimed is limited to an amount that offsets the tax payable in New Zealand on t he a ttributed FIF or CFC income derived as if it were stand-alone income in the relevant year. Any surplus is not refundable but may be carried forward to a subsequent income year under s LK 4 provided the loss carry forward requirements of s LK 5 are met. 109.In ordinary circumstances, the tax is paid by the CFC or FIF (that is, s LK 1(1)(c) applies). Section LK 1(1)(d) is an important exception, as it deals with the scenario where a CFC or a FIF does not itself pay the CFC’s or FIF’s foreign income tax, but another perso n d oes (for example, a New Zealand investor in the CFC or FIF that is a foreign hybrid entity). Section LK 1(1)(d) was introduced to enable a New Zealand investor in a CFC or a FIF (which is a hybrid company or partnership) to claim an FTC for any foreign income tax paid (for example, US federal income tax paid by the New Zealand investor on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income) against their New Zealand ta x li a bility on attributed CFC or FIF income. 110.The effect of s LK 1(1)(d) is that a New Zealand investor in a hybrid entity (for example, a US LLC) that is a CFC or a FIF (applying the AFIM) may claim an FTC for foreign tax that they pay in relation to that CFC or FIF. This is in the same way as a New Zealand investor in a foreign company that is not a hybrid entity and that is also a CFC or a FIF (applying the AFIM) may claim a tax credit for foreign tax that the CFC or FIF pays. The tax credit can be applied against attributed CFC or FIF income (under the AFIM) only. BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 42 of 64 How s CD 18 applies to investments in a US LLC 111.Section CD 18 is a special provision that addresses the possible over-taxation of f oreign-sourced dividend income derived by a New Zealand investor from a foreig n hy brid entity. This situation arises where a shareholder pays the foreign tax of t he hy brid entity that, in ordinary circumstances, the hybrid entity would pay, and this reduces the amount available for distribution as a dividend by the entity. Section CD 18 is directed at hybrid entities such as a US LLC, which is a company for New Zealand tax purposes but taxed as a partnership for US tax purposes. Section CD 18 provides: CD 18 Dividend reduced if foreign tax paid on company’s income When this section applies (1)This section applies when a person— (a)derives a dividend from a company that is a foreign company; and (b)has a liability under the laws of a country or territory outside New Zealand for income tax on income of the company corresponding to the liability that the person would have under the laws of New Zealand for income tax on income of the company if the company were a partnership in which the person were a partner; and (c)pays the income tax; and (d)provides to the Commissioner upon request, in the time allowed by the Commissioner, sufficient information to satisfy the Commissioner as to the amount of income tax paid. When this section applies (2)The amount of the dividend is reduced by the greater of zero and the amount calculated using the formula— total tax paid − earlier reductions Definition of items in formula (3)In the formula,— (a)total tax paid is the total amount of income tax on income of the company that the person has paid in the country or territory by the time that the person derives the dividend: (b)earlier reductions is the total amount of reductions under this section that, by the time that the person derives the dividend, have affected other dividends derived by the person from the company. \[Original emphasis\] 112.Section CD 18 works to eliminate the over-taxation of dividends derived by a New Zealand investor in a hybrid entity such as a US LLC, so that the New Zealand BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 43 of 64 investor is treated for New Zealand tax purposes as deriving the same amount of dividend income as a New Zealand investor in an ordinary (that is, non-hybrid) foreign company. This outcome is achieved by allowing a New Zealand investor in a foreign hybrid entity to reduce the amount of a dividend derived from the foreign hybrid entity by any foreign tax that the New Zealand investor pays (for example, as a “partner”) on the foreign hybrid’s income. Note that the provision only permits a reduction for tax actually paid by the time the dividend is derived. Unlike subpart LK, it does not extend to “tax paid or payable” to cover any timing mismatches between New Zealand and the foreign jurisdiction. Also, any refunds of foreign tax received must reduce the amount available as a reduction under s CD 18. A New Zealand investor in a US LLC may receive a refund as a result of filing their required personal tax return in the US. For an illustration of the treatment of a tax refund, see Example 2 ( following \[136\]) . 113.There is a requirement under the formula in s CD 18(2) to reconcile the foreign tax deducted from all dividends derived since inception of the investment in the company. This requirement ensures that only amounts of foreign tax the New Zealand investor has paid but has not already claimed as a reduction are available to reduce t he d ividends from the company that are taxed in New Zealand each year. 114.Example 1 illustrates clearly how s CD 18 applies. Example | Tauira 1 – How s CD 18 applies to eliminate over-taxation of dividends This example assumes the following: An individual New Zealand investor’s interest in a US LLC cost less than $50,000 in a year and the investor does not hold any other interest in FIFs. (T hat is, the New Zealand investor is required to pay tax on only dividends derived from the FIF.) The New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income for federal income tax purposes is $1,000. The US LLC makes a $700 distribution in that year. The US imposes 30% ($300) federal income tax on the New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income. The US LLC withholds the tax and pays it on behalf of the New Zealand investor. The US LLC made a distribution to the New Zealand investor in the prior year when the interest in the LLC was first acquired and US federal income tax was paid on that and then used to reduce the dividend derived in the prior year for New Zealand tax purposes. All amounts are expressed in New Zealand dollars. BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 44 of 64 New Zealand tax consequences For New Zealand tax purposes, the $700 distribution and $300 US tax paid on the investor’s behalf will both be a dividend. If the full $1,000 is taxed in New Zealand, there would be over-taxation of that dividend from the New Zealand investor’s perspective compared with a dividend paid by an ordinary non-hybrid foreign company, because no recognition is given to the $300 US federal income tax the New Zealand investor paid. In the case of an ordinary non-hybrid foreign company, the US company would pay the US tax of $300, and the dividend paid to the New Zealand investor would be $700 (after US company tax is paid). Section CD 18 achieves its objective by allowing the New Zealand investor to reduce the amount of the dividend that they derive from a foreign hybrid (the US LLC in this case) by the foreign tax that they pay on their distributive share of “partnership” income. In this example, the New Zealand investor is taxed on $700 ($1,000 – $300), which is the same amount they would have been taxed on if the US LLC had been an ordinary US company and paid the $300 company tax on its own income, before distributing the remaining (after tax) amount of $700. The $300 reduction was made after taking into account the total US federal tax paid on the US LLC since the investment began under the formula in s CD 18(2) and the amount of that tax used to reduce the dividend derived in the prior year. 115.In the context of the Rulings, even though it uses a different mechanism than allowing FTCs, s CD 18 provides relief from the cross-jurisdictional taxation of dividends derived by New Zealand investors from a foreign hybrid entity. Section CD 18 reductions ar e a vailable to investors in a US LLC that is a FIF or a CFC, except where the New Zealand investor is either: 115.1 taxed on FIF income calculated applying the FDR, CV, CM or DRR FIF income calculation methods, because the dividend is “exempt” in this case; or 115.2 a New Zealand company where the dividends derived from a foreign company are exempt income under s CW 9 ( assuming the exclusions in s CW 9(2) or (3) do not apply). How subpart OE (BETA) applies to individual investors in a US LLC 116.Section OE 1(2) provides that a natural person resident in New Zealand may choose to be a BETA person and maintain a BETA. These rules apply to an investment in a CFC and a FIF (where the New Zealand investor adopts the AFIM: s OE 5). BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 45 of 64 117.A BETA is available to an individual investor who has a net New Zealand tax liability (after FTCs have been applied) on their attributed CFC or FIF income. Its purpose is to enable such an investor to credit that amount to their BETA and to use this credit to satisfy any New Zealand tax liability payable on dividends derived from the FIF or CFC. 118.A BETA allows an individual investor to claim a tax credit (for tax that they pay on a ttributed CFC or FIF income) against their tax liability on dividend income, similar to the way an investor in a New Zealand resident company claims an imputation credit for underlying tax paid by the company. In both cases, the purpose of the credit is to avoid economic double taxation on the dividend derived by an individual investor. 119.A New Zealand resident company cannot maintain a BETA. However, as dividends it derives from a foreign company are exempt income under s CW 9 (assuming t he ex clusions in s CW 9(2) and (3) do not apply), economic double taxation does not arise. 120.The BETA tax credit is calculated by applying the formula set out in s OE 19. For example, a New Zealand investor may have attributed CFC or FIF income of $10,000 and foreign tax paid relating to that income of $3,000 (30%). Assume that t he N ew Zealand investor’s New Zealand tax liability is $3,300 (33%). The New Zealand investor can satisfy the New Zealand income tax liability by applying FTCs of $3,000 and paying the net tax liability of $300. The net tax paid of $300 can be credited to a person’s BETA and applied against any subsequent New Zealand tax liability on any dividend derived from the CFC or FIF. 121.The New Zealand investor’s right to use BETA tax credits to satisfy an income tax lia bility and the criteria that need to be satisfied for their use are set out in s OE 20. How the NZ–US DTA applies to an investment in a US LLC 122.A double tax agreement can extend the circumstances where two countries agree to double taxation relief beyond their respective domestic tax laws. Two articles in t he NZ– US DTA deal with relief from double taxation (arts 1(6) and 22) and may be r elevant to the Rulings. Here we consider these articles in the context of whether they can provide any taxation relief beyond the applicable New Zealand domestic laws. Article 22 of the NZ–US DTA provides relief where the same income is taxed to the same person in two tax jurisdictions 123.Article 22 of the NZ–US DTA provides (in part): In the case of New Zealand, double taxation shall be avoided as follows: BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 46 of 64 In accordance with, and subject to any provisions of, the law of New Zealand which may from time to time be in force and which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand tax for tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle hereof), United States tax paid under the law of the United States and consistently with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand arising in the United States (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income; except that such credit shall not exceed the amount of the tax that would be paid to the United States if the resident were not a United States citizen or a United States company. ... For the purpose of allowing relief from double taxation pursuant to this Article, income shall be deemed to arise as follows: (a)income derived by a resident of the United States which may be taxed in New Zealand in accordance with this Convention shall be deemed to arise in New Zealand; (b)income derived by a resident of New Zealand which may be taxed in the United States in accordance with the Convention (other than income taxed by the United States solely because the beneficial owner is a citizen of the United States or a United States company) shall be deemed to arise in the United States; (c)For purposes of paragraph 3, income beneficially owned by a resident o f N ew Zealand who is a citizen of the United States or a United States company shall be deemed to arise in New Zealand to the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions of this paragraph. \[Emphasis added\] 124.Article 22 applies to US tax paid on the same income derived by a New Zealand resident and arising in the US. That is, art 22 provides relief where the same income is taxed to the same person in two tax jurisdiction s. 125.In the US LLC context, an amount allocated and credited to a member’s capital account and distributed to a New Zealand investor is a dividend derived for New Zealand ta x pur poses and will “arise” in the US. However, in terms of the arrangements in t he R ulings, no US tax is paid at source on this dividend distribution, so no FTC is claimable. The New Zealand investor has paid US federal income tax on their distributive share of the US LLC’s US taxable income on a partnership basis, but that is not US tax paid on the distribution to the New Zealand investor (which is a dividend for New Zealand tax purposes). 126.As such, art 22 does not operate to provide any taxation relief for dividend income derived from US LLCs. BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 47 of 64 Article 1(6) of the NZ–US DTA applies to a foreign investment by a New Zealand or US resident through a transparent entity 127.Article 1(6) of the NZ–US DTA deals with transparent entities, stating: An item of income, profit or gain derived through an entity that is fiscally transparent under the laws of either Contracting State shall be considered to be derived by a resident of a State to the extent that the item is treated for purposes of the taxation law of such Contracting State as the income, profit or gain of a resident. 128.Article 1(6) applies to a foreign investment by a New Zealand or US resident through a transparent entity. Income derived through a transparent entity is taxed to a New Zealand or US resident only where that entity is treated as transparent for t he pur poses of New Zealand and US tax law respectively. For example, it applies for a N ew Zealand investor in a partnership established in the US that is also a partnershi p for New Zealand tax purposes. The US partnership is a partnership for New Zealand tax purposes and is transparent for New Zealand tax purposes: s HG 2. In thes e c ircumstances, the New Zealand partner is taxed directly on their share of t he pa rtnership income. 129.In the context of the Rulings, a New Zealand investor in a US LLC derives partnership i ncome under US federal income tax law (which satisfies the first part of art 1(6)), but that partnership income is not treated for the purposes of the taxation law of New Zealand as the income, profit or gain of the New Zealand investor in the US L LC (so the second part of art 1(6) is not satisfied). This is because the US LLC is a company and not a transparent entity for New Zealand tax purposes. 12 130.Article 1(6) does not assist on the facts of the Rulings. Overseas authority 131.The United Kingdom (UK) Supreme Court in Anson v Commissioners for HMRC \[2015\] UKSC 44 considered a dispute involving a UK investor in a Delaware LLC that was taxe d a s a partnership for US income tax purposes. Anson was resident but non-domiciled in the UK for UK tax purposes, meaning he was liable to UK income tax on foreign incom e r emitted to the UK. The dispute revolved around whether Anson was entitled to an 12 This is confirmed in the US Department of the Treasury, Department of the Treasury Technical Explanation of the Protocol Between the United States of America and New Zealand ... signed at Wellington on July 23, 1982 (US Department of the Treasury, Washington, 2008), in an example at 4, last paragraph. BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 48 of 64 FTC for US tax he paid on his distributive share of the US LLC’s income against UK tax paid on foreign remitted income from the US LLC. 132.The UK Supreme Court had to consider whether the income on which Anson paid tax in the US was the “same” as the income on which he was liable to tax in the UK for t he pur poses of art 23(2)(a) of the UK–US Double Tax Agreement. The UK Supreme Court considered that answering that question depended on analysing the legal regim e g overning the respective rights of the entity and its members in relation to the profit. 133.Based on the First-tier Tribunal’s findings of fact that Anson was entitled to the share o f the profits allocated to him by the US LLC as they arose, the UK Supreme Court held that it followed that Anson’s “income arising” in the US was his share of the profits, and this was therefore the income liable to tax under UK law to the extent it was remitte d t o the UK. Therefore, Anson qualified for double tax relief under art 23(2)(a) of the UK– US Double Tax Agreement as his liability to tax in the UK was computed by reference to the “same” income as was taxed in the US. 134.The Commissioner does not consider that the decision of the UK S upreme Court in Anson affects the analysis set out in this commentary. To determine how profit or income is to be taxed in New Zealand, the New Zealand legislative scheme requires a n ent ity to be classified for New Zealand tax purposes. Based on the characteristics of a US LLC under US law, the Commissioner considers that a US LLC is a company becaus e the legal characteristics of the US LLC meet the New Zealand tax definition of “company” 13 . Accordingly, the New Zealand legislative scheme treats the US LLC as deriving the income from the conduct of its business (that is, the income is treated as derived by the US LLC, rather than by the members of the US LLC). Consequently, a New Zealand investor in a US LLC will be subject to New Zealand tax on distributions or dividends they derived from the US LLC and/or any FIF income or attributed CFC income, where the US LLC is a FIF or a CFC. 135.Section CD 18 is also an important feature of the scheme of the Act dealing with f oreign hybrid entities. It deals explicitly with company–partnership foreign hybrids (US LLCs in this context) and the over-taxation of foreign source dividend incom e d erived from a foreign hybrid entity. Section CD 18 permits a New Zealand investor i n a foreign hybrid entity to reduce the amount of the dividend they derive from t he f oreign company by the foreign tax that they have paid. Section CD 18 is premised o n t he foreign hybrid entity (US LLC in this context) being a company that derives its own income and pays a dividend to its shareholder (even though it is taxed as a partnershi p i n the foreign tax jurisdiction). 13 In New Zealand, entities and transactions are characterised according to their legal form and not what transaction or entities they most closely resemble: Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154 (CA) at 159. BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 49 of 64 Examples 136.The six examples that follow have these common features: 136.1A New Zealand investor (natural person or company) invests in a US LLC and is not the sole shareholder. 136.2The US LLC is a company for New Zealand tax purposes. 136.3The US LLC owns the assets of the business, and the business is conducted by the US LLC rather than by its members. 136.4The US LLC is treated as a partnership in the US, has not made an election to be taxed as a corporation in the US and the New Zealand investor is subject to US federal income tax on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income. 136.5The New Zealand investor’s US federal income tax liability is withheld by the US LLC and paid on behalf of the New Zealand investor. 136.6The New Zealand investor is required to and does file a US tax return, including their distributive share of the US LLC income and tax withheld on their behalf by the US LLC. 136.7The payment of US federal income tax by the US LLC withheld on behalf of a New Zealand investor is treated in the US LLC’s accounts as a distribution to the investor (that is, as a debit to the member’s capital account). 136.8The US LLC’s payment of the member’s US federal income tax on their behalf is a distribution and a dividend for New Zealand tax purposes. 136.9The Managing Members of the US LLC have the power to make distributions in their sole discretion. (Note that this feature does not apply to Example 2.) 136.10No US tax is paid on distributions from the US LLC, which are dividends for New Zealand tax purposes. 136.11The US federal income tax rate is assumed to be 30%. 136.12Where the New Zealand investor is a natural person, it is assumed they have a marginal tax rate of 33%, are not a transitional resident, and have not opted into the FIF rules where the total cost of all FIF interests they hold are $50,000 or less. 136.13 All amounts are expressed in New Zealand dollars. BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 50 of 64 Example | Tauira 2 – Individual New Zealand investor’s investment in a US LLC is under the $50,000 FIF threshold and distributions to members are mandatory Circumstances An individual New Zealand investor invests in a US LLC that is a FIF for New Zealand tax purposes. The cost of the individual investor’s attributing interest in FIFs does not exceed $50,000 throughout the year. The New Zealand investor can withdraw amounts from their capital account, representing their share of the US LLC’s annual net accounting profits on request, subject to cash being available. The New Zealand investor’s share of the US LLC’s net accounting profit is $1,100, as determined by the US LLC’s operating agreement. This share is credited to the New Zealand investor’s capital account in year 1. The New Zealand investor can withdraw this amount from their capital account as they wish. The New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income for US federal income tax purposes is $1,000, and the US federal income tax liability on that income is $300 (30%). The distributive share is the New Zealand investor’s proportional share of net accounting profits adjusted as required to meet US tax requirements. The New Zealand investor’s US federal tax liability is withheld by the US LLC on behalf of the investor and is treated as a distribution by the US LLC (debited against the New Zealand investor’s capital account) in year 1. The US LLC subsequently distributes $700 to the New Zealand investor in year 2. The New Zealand investor also receives a US tax refund of $50 in year 2 after filing their US tax return for year 1. Years 1 and 2 correspond to two different New Zealand income tax years – New Zealand income tax years 1 and 2. New Zealand tax consequences The New Zealand investor will be taxed on the $1,100 dividend (the amount credited to their capital account and able to be withdrawn by the New Zealand investor) derived from the US LLC, allocated to the income year their capital account is credited. The investor does not have FIF income due to s CQ 5(1)(d). The New Zealand investor will be subject to tax on this dividend in New Zealand in income tax year 1, which is the year when the amount was credited to the New Zealand investor’s capital account and available for the New Zealand investor to withdraw. The total distribution of $1,000 (the $700 distribution and the $300 US federal income tax that the US LLC paid on behalf of the New Zealand investor) is not subject to New BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 51 of 64 Zealand tax. This is because the dividend has already been subject to New Zealand tax in New Zealand income tax year 1. The dividend cannot be taxed twice due to s BD 3(6). Section CD 18 applies to reduce the amount of the dividend by the US federal income tax paid by the New Zealand investor ($300) in year 1. In other words, the New Zealand investor’s dividend income is $1,100 (the dividend) less $300 (the US tax paid by the New Zealand investor). The New Zealand investor pays New Zealand income tax (at 33%) on the reduced dividend of $800 ($264). Both the US tax of $300 taken as a reduction of dividend income and the $50 tax refund received in year 2 decrease the amount of US tax that can be claimed in the future under s CD 18 from year 2 onwards. The New Zealand investor cannot claim a New Zealand FTC (under ss LJ 1(1) and LJ 2(1) or the NZ–US DTA) for US federal income tax on the distributive share of the US LLC’s income against their New Zealand tax liability on dividend income derived from the US LLC. This is because the US federal income tax paid on the New Zealand investor’s distributive share is not US tax paid on a dividend derived from the US LLC and so is not tax paid on the relevant segment of foreign-sourced income. E xample | Tauira 3: Individual New Zealand investor’s investment in a US LLC is under the $50,000 FIF threshold and distributions are not mandatory Circumstances An individual New Zealand investor invests in a US LLC that is a FIF for New Zealand tax purposes. The cost of the individual investor’s attributing interest in FIFs does not exceed $50,000 throughout the year. The New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income for US federal income tax purposes is $1,000, and the US federal income tax liability on that income is $300 (30%). The New Zealand investor’s US federal tax liability is withheld and paid by the US LLC on behalf of the investor and is treated as a distribution by the US LLC (debited against the New Zealand investor’s capital account). The US LLC subsequently distributes $700 to the New Zealand investor. New Zealand tax consequences The New Zealand investor will be taxed on only the actual dividends (the $700 distribution and $300 US federal income that the US LLC paid on behalf of the New BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 52 of 64 Zealand investor) derived from the US LLC under s CD 1. The investor does not have FIF income due to s CQ 5(1)(d). Section CD 18 applies to reduce the amount of the dividend by the US federal income tax paid by the New Zealand investor ($300). In other words, the New Zealand investor’s dividend income is $1,000 (the dividend) less $300 (the US tax paid by the New Zealand investor). The New Zealand investor pays New Zealand income tax (at 33%) on the reduced dividend of $700 ($231). The New Zealand investor cannot claim a New Zealand FTC (under subpart LJ or the New Zealand–US DTA) for US federal income tax paid on the distributive share against their New Zealand tax liability on the $1,000 distribution treated as dividend income derived from the US LLC. This is because the US federal income tax paid on the New Zealand investor’s US LLC distributive share is not paid on the dividend distribution from the US LLC and so is not tax paid on the relevant segment of foreign-sourced income. E xample | Tauira 4: Individual New Zealand investor in a US LLC adopts one of four FIF income calculation methods Circumstances A New Zealand individual investor invests in a US LLC that is a FIF for New Zealand tax purposes. The cost of their interest is $60,000. The New Zealand investor can adopt and chooses to adopt one of the four FIF income calculation methods: FDR, CV, CM or DRR. The New Zealand investor’s FIF income from the US LLC adopting FDR is $2,000. The New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income for federal income tax purposes is $2,800, and the US federal income tax liability on that income is $840 (30%). The New Zealand investor’s US federal tax liability is withheld and paid by the US LLC on behalf of the investor and is treated as a distribution by the US LLC (debited against the New Zealand investor’s capital account). The US LLC subsequently distributes $1,900 to the New Zealand investor. New Zealand tax consequences BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 53 of 64 The New Zealand investor will be taxed on their FIF income as calculated by applying one of the four FIF income calculation methods. In this example, the FIF (FDR) income is $2,000 and New Zealand tax (at 33%) is $660. The total distribution of $2,740 (the $1,900 distribution and the $840 US federal income tax paid by the US LLC on behalf of the New Zealand investor) paid to the New Zealand investor by the US LLC is excluded income under ss EX 59(2) and CX 57B. Section CD 36 also explicitly excludes it from being a dividend for New Zealand tax purposes. Under s CD 36, a distribution is not a dividend where a person adopts one of the four methods (FDR, CV, CM or DRR) of calculating FIF income. Section CD 18, which provides relief from the over-taxation of dividend distributions from foreign hybrid entities, does not apply because the distribution is not a dividend under s CD 36. A New Zealand investor cannot claim a New Zealand FTC (under subpart LJ or the NZ– US DTA) for US federal income tax on their distributive share against their New Zealand tax liability on FIF income. This is because the US federal income tax paid on the New Zealand investor’s distributive share is not foreign tax paid on FIF income and so is not tax paid on the relevant segment of foreign-sourced income. A New Zealand investor who chooses to adopt CV for their FIF income will treat the payment of the $840 of US tax on its behalf as a cost, a gain, and a reduction of the closing value under the formula in s EX 51(1) when calculating their FIF income. E xample | Tauira 5: New Zealand investor adopts the AFIM for calculating FIF income Circumstances A New Zealand investor (a company or individual) invests in a US LLC that is a FIF for New Zealand tax purposes. The New Zealand investor can adopt and chooses to adopt the AFIM for calculating FIF income, and the exemption for a non-attributing active FIF in s CQ 5(1)(c)(xv) does not apply. The US LLC does not hold any FIF interests. The New Zealand investor’s FIF attributed income is $2,000 in their first year of holding the US LLC. The New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income for federal income tax purposes is $2,100. T he US federal income tax liability on that income in the first year is $630 (30%). BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 54 of 64 The New Zealand investor’s US federal tax liability ($630) is withheld and paid by the US LLC on behalf of the investor and is treated as a distribution by the US LLC (debited against the New Zealand investor’s capital account). The US LLC subsequently distributes $1,400 to the New Zealand investor. New Zealand tax consequences The New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand income tax on FIF income and (if they are an individual) on any dividends they derived from the US LLC. The New Zealand investor is taxed on their share of the FIF’s income ($2,000), and New Zealand tax is $660 (33% if an individual) or $560 (28% if a company) under ss CQ 4, CQ 5, CQ 6, EX 44(1)(b) and EX 50. The US federal income tax the New Zealand investor paid ($630) on their share of the US LLC’s income is creditable against their FIF attributed income tax liability: s LK 1(1)(d). Note that this tax credit only applies to the extent it does not exceed the New Zealand tax payable on the FIF attributed income and it only relates to foreign tax paid in relation to income that is attributed FIF income. The individual New Zealand investor’s net New Zealand tax liability is $660 less $630 (the FTC for US tax paid on their distributive share of the US LLC’s profit), which equals $30 net New Zealand tax payable. For a company investor, no further New Zealand tax is payable as the FTC exceeds the New Zealand tax amount ($560 – $630). The total distribution of $2,030 (the $1,400 distribution and the $630 US federal income tax paid by US LLC on behalf of the New Zealand investor) from the US LLC is a dividend and so it is income under s CD 1 for New Zealand tax purposes. The New Zealand tax consequences of the dividend distribution are as follows: Where the New Zealand investor is a company, any dividends derived by a company from a foreign company are exempt income under s CW 9 (provided the exclusions in s CW 9(2) and (3) do not apply). No FTCs are claimable. If the New Zealand investor is an individual, they may reduce the amount of the dividend they derived from the US LLC ($2,030) by the US federal income tax paid on their share of the US LLC’s income ($630): s CD 18. The New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand tax on the reduced dividend (that is, net of foreign tax they paid in the US, which is $1,400). An individual New Zealand investor may choose to be a BETA person under s OE 1(2). If the individual investor has a net New Zealand tax liability on BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 55 of 64 their attributed FIF income (after claiming an FTC), then the individual investor may claim a BETA tax credit (for the New Zealand tax they have paid on their attributed FIF income) against the New Zealand tax liability on the reduced dividend (net of foreign tax paid through the application of s CD 18) under s OE 20. The individual New Zealand investor’s net New Zealand tax liability after FTCs is $30 (the FIF income tax liability of $660 ($2,000 FIF income × 33% tax rate) less FTC $630 = $30). The investor may use the $30 as a BETA tax credit to satisfy any New Zealand tax liability on dividends they derived from the FIF. E xa mple | Tauira 6: Investment in a US LLC that is a CFC Circumstances A New Zealand investor (company or individual) has an income interest of 10% in a US LLC that is a CFC. The CFC is not a non-attributing active CFC under ss CQ 2(1)(h) and EX 21B. The US LLC does not hold any FIF interests. The New Zealand investor’s CFC income is $2,000 in the first year of their investment. The New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income in that same year is $1,900. The US federal income tax liability on that income is $570 (30%). The New Zealand investor’s US federal tax liability ($570) is withheld and paid by the US LLC on behalf of the investor and is treated as a distribution by the US LLC (debited against the New Zealand investor’s capital account). The US LLC subsequently distributes $1,300 to the New Zealand investor. New Zealand tax consequences The New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand income tax on CFC income and any dividends derived from the US LLC. The New Zealand investor is taxed on their share of the CFC’s income, that is $2,000. New Zealand tax for the individual (at 33%) is $660 and for the company (at 28%) is $560 under ss CQ 1 and CQ 2. The US federal income tax the New Zealand investor paid ($570) on their share of the US LLC’s income in the same year they acquired the investment is creditable against the New Zealand investor’s CFC attributed income tax liability: s LK 1(1)(d). Note that this tax credit only applies to the extent it does not exceed the New Zealand tax BR PUB 23/09 – 23/13 | 24 July 2023 \[ UNCLASSIFIED\] Page 56 of 64 payable on the CFC attributed income and it only relates to foreign tax paid in relation to income that is attributed CFC income. The individual New Zealand investor’s net New Zealand tax liability is $660 less $570 (the FTC for US tax paid on their share of the US LLC’s profit), which equals $90 net New Zealand tax payable. Where the New Zealand investor is a company, there is no further New Zealand tax liability as the FTC of $570 exceeds the New Zealand tax liability of $560. The total distribution of $1,870 (the $1,300 distribution and the $570 US federal income tax paid by US LLC on behalf of the New Zealand investor) from the US LLC is a dividend and so it is income under s CD 1 for New Zealand tax purposes. The New Zealand tax consequences of the dividend distribution are as follows: Where the New Zealand investor is a company, any dividends derived by a company from a foreign company are exempt income under s CW 9 (provided the exclusions in s CW 9(2) and (3) do not apply). No FTCs are claimable. If the New Zealand investor is an individual, they may reduce the amount of the dividend they derived from the US LLC ($1,870) by the US federal income tax paid on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income ($570): s CD 18. The New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand tax on the reduced dividend (that is, net of foreign tax they paid in the US, which is $1,300). An individual New Zealand investor can choose to be a BETA person under s OE 1(2). If the individual investor has a net New Zealand tax liability on their attributed FIF income (after claiming FTC), then they may claim a BETA tax credit (for the New Zealand tax they have paid on their attributed CFC income) against the New Zealand tax liability on the reduced dividend (net of foreign tax paid through the application of s CD 18) under s OE 20. The individual New Zealand investor’s net New Zealand tax liability after FTCs is $90 (the FIF income tax liability of $660 ($2,000 FIF income × 33% tax rate) – FTC $570 = $90). The investor may use the $90 as a BETA tax credit to satisfy any New Zealand tax liability on dividends they derived from the CFC.

The US LLC does not hold any FIF interests. The New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income for federal income tax purposes in their first year of investment is $1,000, and the US federal income tax liability on that income is $300 (30%). The New Zealand investor’s US federal tax liability ($300) is withheld and paid by the US LLC on behalf of the investor and is treated as a distribution by the US LLC (debited against the New Zealand investor’s capital account). The US LLC subsequently distributes $700 to the New Zealand investor. New Zealand tax consequences There is no attributed income for either CFC or FIF purposes under s CQ 2(1), due to s CQ 2(1)(h), or under s CQ 5(1), due to s CQ 5(1)(c)(xv). The total distribution of $1,000 (the $700 distribution and the $300 US federal income tax paid by US LLC on behalf of the New Zealand investor) from the US LLC is a dividend and so it is income under s CD 1 for New Zealand tax purposes.

However, as there is no FIF or CFC attributed income for the income year, no BETA credit is available for that year.

Public Rulings set out the Commissioner’s view on how tax laws apply to a specific set of facts – called an arrangement. Taxpayers whose circumstances match the arrangement described in a Public Ruling may apply the ruling but are not obliged to do so. Public Rulings are binding on the Commissioner. This means that if you are entitled to apply a Public Ruling and you have calculated your tax liability in accordance with the ruling, the Commissioner must accept that assessment. A Public Ruling applies only to the taxation laws and arrangement set out in the ruling, and only for the period specified in the ruling. It is important to note that a general similarity between a taxpayer’s circumstances and the arrangement covered by a Public Ruling will not necessarily lead to the same tax result.

GST – Supplies of properties used for transitional housing
==========================================================

These Public Rulings consider the GST treatment of supplies of properties by landlords to organisations for use in the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development’s Transitional Housing Programme. Many organisations don’t own their own properties so enter into leases for properties with private landlords (which may include developers, investors and motel owners). There had previously been some uncertainty with how the landlords account for GST.   
  
These items specify when the landlords will be subject to GST and when they have exempt supplies. BR Pub 24/01 applies to a supply of a property that will be an exempt supply on the basis that the property will be used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling.   
  
BR Pub 24/02 and BR Pub 24/03 apply to supplies of a property that will not be exempt supplies.  The commentary to these Rulings assists in determining whether the supply will be taxable or exempt.   
  
These rulings have been prepared in response to requests for clarity in this sector.  The conclusions in these items have no effect on the rent paid by transitional housing tenants, which is calculated based on a fixed proportion of their income.   
  
Any landlords with specific queries about their situation can send a web message through their MyIR account using “transitional housing” in the subject line and this will flow through to IR staff familiar with the issues in this area.

An amendment to s 11A(1)(k), effective from 1 April 2017, means that this ruling is unlikely to provide the correct answer for legal services provided to non-residents relating to transactions involving land in New Zealand. Please refer to Interpretation Statement IS 18/07 Goods and services tax – Zero-rating of services related to land for further guidance.  This is a reissue of BR Pub 10/09. For more information about earlier publications of this Public Ruling see the Commentary to this Ruling. GOODS AND SERVICES TAX – LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDED TO NON- RESIDENTS RELATING TO TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING LAND IN NEW ZEALAND PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 15/03 This is a Public Ruling made under s 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of s 11A(1)(k). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the supply by a registered person of legal services to a non- resident (who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed) relating to: • transactions involving the sale or purchase of land in New Zealand or the lease, licence, or mortgage of land in New Zealand, or • easements, management agreements, construction agreements, trust deeds, guarantees and other agreements concerning land in New Zealand, or • disputes arising in relation to land in New Zealand. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: Under s 11A(1)(k), the supply of the following types of legal services to a non- resident who is not in New Zealand at the time the legal services are performed is zero-rated: • legal services relating to transactions involving the sale and purchase of land in New Zealand (including the drafting of agreements for the sale and purchase of land, the provision of legal advice in relation to the sale and purchase transaction and ancillary and related services leading up to the completion of the sale and purchase transaction); 2 UNCLASSIFIED • legal services relating to transactions involving the lease, licence or mortgage of land in New Zealand; • legal services relating to easements, management agreements, construction agreements, trust deeds, guarantees and other agreements relating to land in New Zealand; and • legal services relating to disputes arising in relation to land in New Zealand (including drafting court documents, court appearances, representation in negotiations and settlements and general advice in relation to such disputes). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on 24 May 2015. This Ruling is signed by me on 4 March 2015. Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 1 UNCLASSIFIED COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 15/03 This commentary is not a legally binding statement. The commentary is intended to help readers understand and apply the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 15/03 (the Ruling). Legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. Relevant legislative provisions are reproduced in the Appendix to this commentary. Contents Summary ................................................................................................................................ 1 Background ............................................................................................................................. 2 Application of the Legislation ..................................................................................................... 3 References ............................................................................................................................ 11 Appendix – Legislation ............................................................................................................ 12 Summary 1. Services supplied to a person who is a non-resident, and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, will be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k) provided that the services are not directly in connection with land situated in New Zealand or any improvement to the land. 2. The following principles on the interpretation of the phrase “directly in connection with” can be drawn from case law: • Whether there is sufficient relationship between two things, so as to be “in connection with” each other, is a matter of fact and degree and impression and the evaluation of whether there is a sufficient relationship between these two things requires a common sense assessment of the factual situation. Each case depends on its own facts and the particular statute under consideration. • The inclusion of the word “directly” in section 11A(1)(k)(i) indicates that a close connection would be required between a service and land for the service to be regarded as a service that is supplied “directly in connection with” the land. • Although there must be a direct relationship between the service and the property, for the service to be directly in connection with that property, the non-resident to whom the service is provided need not own or be entitled to the use or possession of the particular property. • Services that are “directly in connection with” land clearly include services that have a physical effect on the land, such as gardening or repairs to improvements to land. • Services that merely bring about or facilitate a transaction that has direct effect on land and which are one step removed from a transaction that has a direct effect on the land are not supplied “directly in connection with” the land. This though is a matter of fact and degree as discussed above. • If the service could not have been performed but for the existence of the land, this may suggest that the service is supplied “directly in connection with” the land, but this factor is not conclusive. 2 UNCLASSIFIED 3. Sections 11A(2), 11A(3) and 11A(3B) are relevant when considering whether a person is outside New Zealand or whether the services are received in New Zealand. 4. Legal services of the type outlined in the Arrangement are not directly in connection with the land or improvements to the land. Rather they are either one step removed from the transaction that has a direct effect on the land, or ancillary to that transaction. Background 5. BR Pub 15/03 is a reissue of BR Pub 10/09, which expires on 23 May 2015. This Ruling is essentially the same as BR Pub 10/09 and the original ruling, BR Pub 07/03. However, minor amendments have been made to reflect the introduction of s 11A(3B). 6. Under s 11A(1)(k), goods and services tax (GST) is chargeable at the rate of 0% on services supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. However, s 11A(1)(k) does not apply to services that are supplied “directly in connection with” land situated in New Zealand: s 11A(1)(k)(i)(A). 7. New Zealand legal firms may provide legal services to clients who are non- residents and who are outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Such legal services could include: • legal services relating to transactions involving the sale and purchase of land in New Zealand (including the drafting of agreements for sale and purchase of land, the provision of general legal advice in relation to the sale and purchase transaction and ancillary or related services leading up to the completion of the sale and purchase transaction); • legal services relating to transactions involving the lease, licence or mortgage of land in New Zealand; • legal services relating to easements, management agreements, construction agreements, trust deeds, guarantees and other agreements in relation to land in New Zealand (including the drafting of documents and the provision of legal advice in relation to such transactions); and • legal services relating to disputes arising in relation to land in New Zealand (including drafting court documents, court appearances, representation in negotiations and settlements and the provision of general legal advice in relation to such disputes). 8. This ruling concerns the meaning of the phrase “directly in connection with” in s 11A(1)(k)(i) and the degree of connection necessary between legal services and land in New Zealand before such services will be supplied “directly in connection with” land in New Zealand. 9. It is noted that the definition of “resident” in s 2 deems a person to be resident in New Zealand to the extent that the person carries on any taxable activity (or any other activity), while having any fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that taxable activity (or other activity). Owning land in New Zealand can, in certain circumstances, therefore, affect the residence status of the purchaser. This Ruling does not consider the application of the residence provisions. Rather, it proceeds on the basis that the purchaser is non-resident. 3 UNCLASSIFIED Application of the Legislation Meaning of “directly in connection with” 10. In Case E84 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,441 at 59,446, Judge Bathgate discussed the meaning of the phrase “in connection with” in the context of the Income Tax Act 1976 in the following terms: ...It is a matter of degree whether, on the interpretation of a particular statute, there is a sufficient relationship between subject and object to come within the words “in connection with” or not. It is clear that no hard and fast rule can be or should be applied to the interpretation of the words “in connection with”. Each case depends on its own facts and the particular statute under consideration. ... Its proper interpretation depends on the context in which the phrase is used. It may mean “substantial relation in a practical business sense”, or it may have a far more restricted meaning, depending on its context, ... \[Emphasis added\] 11. Judge Bathgate considered that it is a question of fact and degree and impression whether a sufficient relationship exists between two things for them to be “in connection with” each other. He held that the evaluation of whether two things are “in connection with” each other requires a common sense assessment of the factual situation. 12. However, in s 11A(1)(k)(i) the phrase “in connection with” is qualified by the word “directly”. 13. The interpretation of the phrase “directly in connection with” in the GST context was considered in Auckland Regional Authority v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,080 (HC), Wilson & Horton Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221 (HC) (appealed as (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 (CA)), Case S88 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,551 (appealed as CIR v Suzuki New Zealand Ltd (2000) 19 NZTC 15,819 (HC) and (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096 (CA)), Malololailai Interval Holidays New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,137 (HC) and Case T54 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,410. These cases illustrate how the phrase is to be interpreted in the context of s 11A(1)(k)(i)(A). 14. The issue considered in the Auckland Regional Authority case was whether landing dues, terminal services charges and international garbage disposal charges levied by the ARA (the operator of Auckland International Airport) were paid for services that were supplied “directly in connection with” the service of international transportation. Barker J held that landing dues (which were paid for the use of runways, turnoffs, taxiways and holding bays) were supplied “directly in connection with” international transportation. This was because the service of international transportation could not be supplied without the provision of runways etc. However, he considered that the terminal services charge (which related to the use of terminals and equipment used for embarkation or disembarkation from international aircraft, maintenance and cleaning of luggage carousels, gate lounges, baggage makeup, distribution and storage areas) were “ancillary” to the supply of international transportation. This was in the sense of being secondary or subservient. Barker J also considered that the garbage disposal service was a separate service from the supply of international transportation services. That is, although an essential service, it was ancillary to the service of transportation. 15. The Auckland Regional Authority case is not directly on point. This is because it addresses the issue of whether two services are supplied “directly in connection with” each other, rather than whether a service is 4 UNCLASSIFIED supplied “directly in connection with” land or other goods in New Zealand. However, by analogy, the case suggests that a service would not necessarily be “in connection with” an item even if the service could not have been performed without the existence of that item. 16. In Wilson & Horton (HC), the issue was whether the supply of advertising space in a newspaper was “directly in connection with” the goods advertised. In the High Court, Hillyer J considered that the goods that were the subject of the advertising were “at least one step removed from the services supplied by the newspaper proprietor” (at 11,224). Therefore, the advertising services were not supplied “directly in connection with” land or any moveable personal property situated in New Zealand. Hillyer J saw a distinction between the painting of a vessel (which would be directly connected with the vessel) and services supplied to the passengers or crew of the vessel (which would not be directly connected with the vessel). 17. On appeal, it was accepted by both parties that the High Court’s conclusion on this was correct. Therefore, this aspect of the High Court’s judgment was not addressed by the Court of Appeal. 18. The legislation was amended to overturn the result in Wilson & Horton. The amendment was based on the Court of Appeal’s interpretation of the phrase “for and to”, which was previously contained in s 11(2)(e) (now s 11A(1)(k)). However, the phrase “directly in connection with” was retained in the provision. This arguably suggests that the “one step removed” test applied by the High Court in Wilson & Horton reflects the intention of the legislation. 19. In Case S88, Judge Barber considered the phrase “directly in connection with” for an arrangement involving warranties on imported vehicles. The non-resident manufacturer (MC), from whom the importer (SNZ) purchased vehicles, provided a service warranty to SNZ under which it agreed to reimburse SNZ for certain repairs. SNZ on-sold the vehicles to a dealer, who in turn sold the vehicles to the public. The warranty given by SNZ was wider than the warranty that SNZ received from MC. If SNZ was required to reimburse the dealer for the cost of repairs covered by SNZ’s warranty and the particular repairs were also within MC’s warranty, SNZ would claim reimbursement from MC. The issue was whether the payment received from MC was for services supplied “directly in connection with ... moveable personal property” (the vehicles) in New Zealand. 20. Judge Barber considered that the service provided by SNZ was the repair of the vehicles. This was carried out by the dealer on behalf of SNZ. He held that there was a direct relationship between the repair service and the vehicle. At 7,558, he noted that the repair service could not be performed but for the existence of the vehicle: In my view, the repair services effected by the dealer are directly in connection with the vehicles originally manufactured by MC but which, at the time of repair, are owned by the customer as purchaser from the dealer. The latter has, shortly before, purchased the vehicle from the objector. The moveable personal property in question is the repaired vehicle. There is a direct relationship or connection between the service of the repairs and the vehicle. Accordingly, the said “proviso” to s 11(2)(e) must apply to the facts of this case and prevent the objectors from relying on the zero-rating provisions of the s 11(2)(e). The repair service could not be performed but for the existence of the vehicle. The repairs were carried out for the objector (and others) which was carrying them out for MC (and others). The objector was not merely arranging for the repairs to be carried out, but was responsible under warranty to make the repairs — as was MC. That activity, or supply, meets the statutory 5 UNCLASSIFIED nexus between goods and the service. The service is the actual repair of vehicles even though that work was performed by a contractor — usually the dealer. I agree ... that s 11(2)(e) requires the existence of a linkage between the non- resident for whom the services are supplied and the moveable personal property, situated in New Zealand, in relation to which the services are performed. However, there is no requirement in s 11(2)(e) or anywhere else, that at the time the services are performed, the moveable property must be owned by the non-resident person, or that the non-resident person must be entitled to use or possession of the property. \[Emphasis added\] 21. The High Court upheld Judge Barber’s decision (CIR v Suzuki New Zealand Ltd). At 15,830, McGechan J considered that the repair services provided by the importer were analogous to the “painting the ship” example given in Wilson & Horton: I have no doubt that repair services were carried out directly in connection with moveable personal property situated in New Zealand at the time the services were performed. Quite simply, they were repairs carried out on cars within New Zealand. The situation equates \[to\] “painting the ship”. The nexus could not be closer. ... The duality involved is not prohibitive. ... while there was one repair, it arose under and met two quite separate contracts with two different persons. So far as SMC is concerned, the repair was a service to SMC, quite irrespective of the other contract with an SNZ customer likewise discharged. I see no reason why a provision of services to SMC under one contract should be viewed differently because of provision of services to a customer under another. They are concurrent but different supplies. The facts that SMC is non-resident, and a non-owner, are of no present consequence given the way s 11(1)(e)(ii) is worded. \[Emphasis added\] 22. The Court of Appeal agreed that the repair services were supplied “directly in connection with” moveable personal property in New Zealand. Blanchard J, giving the judgment of the court, said at 17,102–17,103: There is a nexus in both cases between the performance and the consideration given by the other party. In the present case there is a more than sufficient financial and legal connection, as demonstrated by the evidence, between SMC’s payments and the carrying out of the repairs on behalf of SNZ by its dealers. The repairs may have been done for the customers, in practical terms, under SNZ’s standard warranty, but they were also done for SMC under its warranty. ... It follows from what we have said that we also reject the argument, made in relation to s 11(2)(e), that the services were not supplied directly in connection with movable personal property situated in New Zealand. The repair services were obviously supplied in relation to goods, namely motor vehicles, which were situated in New Zealand. The supply of repairs could hardly be more directly connected with the motor vehicles. The fact that they may have no longer been owned by SMC or SNZ is irrelevant. Section 11(2)(e) therefore has no application. \[Emphasis added\] 23. In Malololailai Interval Holidays, a New Zealand company had supplied services relating to the marketing of timeshare interval holidays at a resort in Fiji to another New Zealand company. The issue was whether the marketing services were “supplied directly in connection with land, or any improvements thereto, situated outside New Zealand”. If so, the services would be zero-rated under s 11(2)(b) (now s 11A(1)(e)). As the phrase “directly in connection with” has the same meaning throughout s 11A (Wilson & Horton (HC) at 11,224), the Malololailai case is relevant to the interpretation of the phrase in the context of s 11A(1)(k)(i). 24. In Malololailai at 13,144, Neazor J referred to Case E84: A good deal of the debate in that case about whether a narrow or wide interpretation of the statutory phrase was appropriate might have been seen as 6 UNCLASSIFIED unnecessary if the word “directly” had been used, as it is in s 11 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 25. These comments highlight the importance of the addition of the word “directly”. The word “directly” narrows the scope of what might be considered to be “in connection with” the land and confirms that a direct relationship must exist between the relevant services and land. 26. The Malololailai case also confirms that the recipient of a service need not acquire a legal interest in land before the service can be “directly in connection with” the land. At 13,143 Neazor J commented: It is not in my view necessary to consider the first point of Mr McLay’s argument further than that, because the issue is not whether the purchaser acquires land or an interest in land, but whether the services provided by the marketer on behalf of the objector are “directly in connection with land”, which may involve much less than acquiring an interest in the land. By way of example, the provision of gardening services would surely come within the statutory words. 27. Neazor J considered that a transaction between the New Zealand vendor and the purchaser of an interval holiday would be “directly in connection with” land outside New Zealand, but that the marketing services supplied by the marketing company (although essential to bring together the vendor and purchaser and although closely related to the sale and purchase transaction) were not “directly in connection with” the land. The marketing services merely facilitated a transaction that was directly connected to the land (the transaction between vendor and purchaser). At 13,146, Neazor J considered that (as with the advertising services in Wilson & Horton) the marketing services were one step removed from a transaction that directly related to the land: I would regard the contractual transaction between \[the New Zealand selling company\] and the purchaser of an interval holiday as within the descriptive words “directly in connection with land or any improvement thereto”, although that determination is not essential to this decision, but when attention is paid to the services supplied by \[the marketing company\] to \[the NZ selling company\] consider that those services are not within the statutory description. What \[the marketing company\] does is to advertise and promote interval holidays for \[the NZ selling company\] and negotiate the contract for individual holidays (including the consideration for that contract between the purchaser and \[the NZ selling company\]) up to the point where the contract is effected between those two parties. The services provided by \[the marketing company\] are not directly in connection with the land or the improvements. The transaction of those considered which would be in that category is the transaction between \[the NZ selling company\] and the purchaser. The transaction between \[the marketing company\] and \[the NZ selling company\] is one which brings about the transaction which has direct effect, but in my view is of a kind to which Hillyer J’s words may properly be applied — it is one step removed from the direct transaction. If one of the analogies referred to needs to be chosen I would take that of the publication of advertisements in the Wilson & Horton case. The newspaper proprietor’s services facilitated or opened the way to the transactions between vendor and purchaser, and that in my view is what \[the marketing company\] did, although it was more closely involved in the transaction to which the statutory words apply than the publisher of an advertisement would be. Nevertheless the transaction having direct effect was not that of the publisher, or in this case of the sales agent. \[Emphasis added\] 28. The Malololailai case was decided before the High Court and the Court of Appeal judgments in Suzuki. Although Malololailai was referred to in submissions to the High Court in Suzuki, the High Court did not discuss it in detail and the Court of Appeal did not refer to it. The Commissioner considers that the approach in Malololailai is consistent with the approach 7 UNCLASSIFIED taken in Wilson & Horton and is not inconsistent with the Suzuki decisions. These cases support a narrow interpretation of the phrase “directly in connection with”. 29. Case T54 concerned the service of producing a video of Japanese honeymoon couples holidaying in New Zealand supplied by a Japanese company. Judge Barber considered that the services were not supplied “directly in connection with” the video camera or the blank tape used to create images (which were later edited to create the final video). Judge Barber considered that the video camera and blank tape were merely tools used to carry out the services and were not the object or objective of the services. He considered that the service provided was the creation of the final video. The judge concluded that the taxpayer had not provided services “directly in connection with” moveable personal property situated in New Zealand at the time the services were performed. This was because the video did not come into existence until after the taxpayer’s services had been performed and at that time the video was outside New Zealand. At 8,414–8,415, Judge Barber said: The resultant video cassette did not come into existence until after the relevant services had been performed. It was not “situated inside New Zealand at the time the services are performed”. Until then it was only a blank tape. There is no other relevant moveable personal property to which the objector’s service could be regarded as supplied “directly in connection with”. Insofar as there is a connection between the said videoing services and the said blank tape (which fills up during the day) and camera and equipment, that connection is not a “direct” connection. That particular tape is only part of the equipment involved in the process of creating another tape — the resultant videotape cassette. Tools and equipment are aids to the supply of such videoing services, and are not the objects of such services. Those services could be regarded as supplied directly in connection with the Japanese tourists who, of course, are not moveable personal property. 30. Case T54 is distinguishable on its facts from the types of situations addressed in this item, because it is not possible to argue that land did not exist before legal services are provided (an argument that was accepted in Case T54). Test of whether services are “directly in connection with” land in New Zealand 31. The following principles on the interpretation of the phrase “directly in connection with” can be drawn from the above cases: • Whether there is sufficient relationship between two things, so as to be “in connection with” each other, is a matter of fact and degree and impression and the evaluation of whether there is a sufficient relationship between these two things requires a common sense assessment of the factual situation. Each case depends on its own facts and the particular statute under consideration (Case E84). • The inclusion of the word “directly” in section 11A(1)(k)(i) indicates that a close connection would be required between a service and land for the service to be regarded as a service that is supplied “directly in connection with” the land (Malololailai). • Although there must be a direct relationship between the service and the property, for the service to be directly in connection with that property, the non-resident to whom the service is provided need not own or be entitled to the use or possession of the particular property (Suzuki). 8 UNCLASSIFIED • Services that are “directly in connection with” land clearly include services that have a physical effect on the land, such as gardening or repairs to improvements to land (Malololailai). • Services that merely bring about or facilitate a transaction that has direct effect on land and which are one step removed from a transaction that has a direct effect on the land are not supplied “directly in connection with” the land (Wilson & Horton, Malololailai). This though is a matter of fact and degree as discussed above. • If the service could not have been performed but for the existence of the land, this may suggest that the service is supplied “directly in connection with” the land, but this factor is not conclusive (ARA; Suzuki). 32. As a close relationship is required between the relevant services and land in New Zealand, the services must be supplied directly in connection with specific land to fall within s 11A(1)(k)(i)(A). Legal services 33. Legal services that may be supplied to non-residents include: • Legal services relating to transactions involving the sale and purchase of land in New Zealand An analogy can be drawn between the marketing services considered in the Malololailai case and legal services for the sale and purchase of land in New Zealand. In Malololailai, the court held that the marketing services did not have a direct effect on the land and that they merely facilitated a transaction that had a direct effect on the land (that is, the sale and purchase between the vendor and purchaser). Legal services relating to the sale and purchase of land facilitate or give effect to a transaction between the vendor and purchaser. These have a direct effect on the land but are one step removed from that transaction. Accordingly, legal services relating to the sale and purchase of land in New Zealand (including the drafting of an agreement for the sale and purchase of land in New Zealand, legal advice in relation to a sale and purchase transaction and ancillary or related services leading up to the completion of a sale and purchase transaction) are not services that are supplied “directly in connection with” the land that is the subject of the transaction. Therefore, such services are zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k). • Legal services relating to transactions involving the lease, licence or mortgage of land in New Zealand or legal services relating to easements, management agreements, construction agreements, trust deeds, guarantees and other agreements concerning land in New Zealand The same reasoning as above applies to legal services relating to transactions involving the lease, licence or mortgage of land in New Zealand or legal services relating to easements, management agreements, construction agreements, trust deeds, guarantees and other agreements concerning land in New Zealand. These services are provided to a person who enters into a transaction that would have direct effect on the land. However, such legal services are at least one step removed from the land that is the subject matter of the transactions. These services merely assist in bringing about or 9 UNCLASSIFIED facilitating a transaction that has direct effect on the land. Accordingly, legal services relating to transactions involving the lease, licence or mortgage of land in New Zealand or legal services relating to easements, management agreements, construction agreements, trust deeds, guarantees and other agreements concerning land in New Zealand (including the drafting of agreements relating to these transactions and the provision of legal advice for such transactions) are not supplied “directly in connection with” the land that is the subject of these transactions. Such services are zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k). • Legal representation in disputes in relation to land in New Zealand Legal services involving representation in disputes relating to land in New Zealand (including drafting court documents, court appearances, representation in negotiations and settlements, and general advice) are also one step removed from the land to which the dispute relates. These services may be supplied as a consequence of a transaction that has direct effect on the land. However, consistent with the approach taken in Malololailai, the services are not supplied “directly in connection with” the land to which the dispute relates. Therefore, these services are also zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k). Subsections (2), (3) and (3B) 34. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies states that the non-resident recipient of the supply is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Sections 11A(2), 11A(3) and 11A(3B) are relevant when considering whether a person is outside New Zealand or whether the services are received in New Zealand. 35. Section 11A(2) ensures that GST is charged on the supply of services that are consumed in New Zealand but are contracted for by a non-resident who is outside New Zealand. It provides that s 11A(1)(k) does not zero- rate services supplied to a non-resident if another person (including an employee or company director of the non-resident) receives the performance of those services in New Zealand. 36. Section 11A(3) defines the phrase “outside New Zealand” for s 11A(1)(k). It relates to non-resident companies and unincorporated bodies and provides that a non-resident company or unincorporated body that has a minor presence in New Zealand, or whose presence is not effectively connected with the supply of services, will remain outside New Zealand. 37. Section 11A(3B) also defines the phrase “outside New Zealand” for s 11A(1)(k). This provision relates to natural persons and provides that a natural person who has a minor presence in New Zealand that is not directly in connection with the supply of services will remain outside New Zealand. 38. The phrase “directly in connection with” has been considered for s 11A(1)(k). It will have the same meaning in the context of s 11A(3B). 39. What constitutes a minor presence will be determined very much by the facts of the particular case. “Minor” is a relative expression. What is minor is therefore a question of degree and should be regarded as relative to the size or volume of the supplies. A “minor presence” is a presence that is relatively small or unimportant or incidental to the services being supplied. In determining whether a presence is minor, the relative size or importance of the presence of the entity or person when compared with 10 UNCLASSIFIED the presence of the New Zealand supplier must be considered. This will involve a consideration of, inter alia, the relative numbers of people connected with the supply, the amount of time spent in connection with the supply by those people and the relative importance of the people to the services being supplied. 40. The test of “effectively connected” is also a question of fact. The relationship of the supply with the presence in New Zealand must be more than remotely connected, but can be more than one step removed from the presence. The phrase is therefore broader than the phrase “directly in connection with”. If the presence is attributable to the supply in question, then it is very likely that the presence will be effectively connected with that supply. 41. Discussion of these provisions and some relevant examples are set out in: • “GST — Treatment of Exported Services” Taxation Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 9 (October 1999): 12, and • “Zero-rated Services Supplied to Non-Residents” Taxation Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 7 (August 2014): 98. Example 42. Steve, who is a US resident, comes to New Zealand with a view to purchasing land for investment purposes. He returns to the US and continues to carry on negotiations for the purchase of land from a distance. Tracey, a New Zealand solicitor, arranges for searches of the land in Land Information New Zealand’s records to be carried out and obtains a LIM report from the local authority. She provides advice on tax issues relating to the purchase, whether Overseas Investment Commission consent to the purchase is required and general legal advice regarding the transaction. Tracey then drafts an agreement for sale and purchase, which is signed by both parties. She also advises Steve regarding a mortgage to be secured over the land, drafts a transfer to be signed by the vendor and attends to settlement of the transaction. 43. After settlement, Steve telephones a real estate agent and arranges for the property to be leased. Tracey drafts the lease and negotiates with the lessee’s solicitor regarding the form of the lease. The lease is signed and the lessee takes occupation of the property. 44. The legal services provided by Tracey either facilitate transactions between Steve and the vendor, the mortgagee or the lessee that have a direct effect on the land (by creating or changing legal interests in the land) or arise as a consequence of these transactions. However, Tracey’s legal services are one step removed from transactions that directly affect the land. The legal services are not supplied directly in connection with land in New Zealand. Therefore, the services will be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k), provided Steve: • remains a non-resident; and • is outside New Zealand at all times when these services are performed, or • has only a minor presence in New Zealand that is not directly in connection with the supply of the services. 11 UNCLASSIFIED References Expired Rulings BR Pub 07/03 “Legal services provided to non- residents relating to transactions involving land in New Zealand” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 6 (July 2007): 4 BR Pub 10/09 “Legal services provided to non- residents relating to transactions involving land in New Zealand” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 9 (October 2010): 2 Subject references Legal services Zero-rating provisions Legislative references Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, ss 11A(1)(k), 11A(2), 11A(3), 11A(3B) Case references Auckland Regional Authority v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,080 (HC) Wilson & Horton Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221 (HC); (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 (CA) Case S88 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,551 Case T54 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,410 CIR v Suzuki New Zealand Ltd (2000) 19 NZTC 15,819 (HC); (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096 (CA) Malololailai Interval Holidays New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,137 (HC) 12 UNCLASSIFIED Appendix – Legislation 1.

Ngā pekanga Branches
====================

The great majority of branches of multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in New Zealand are permanent establishments (PEs) of enterprises headquartered in treaty partner countries, especially Australia. Our double taxation agreements (DTAs) are based on the OECD's Model Tax Convention (the MTC). The relevant article of the MTC is Article 7 which addresses the treatment of business profits of PEs. Section BH 1(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for the overriding effect of DTAs in determining a person’s tax obligations.

Article 7 of the MTC
--------------------

Article 7 of New Zealand’s DTAs is based on the corresponding pre-2010 MTC version.

The 2010 update of the MTC contained a revised Article 7, along with associated revised commentary. The changes resulted from the OECD’s Report on the Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments.

We have not endorsed these changes and have made an explicit reservation on Article 7 of the MTC. This reservation states:

Reservation on Article 7 of the MTC

'New Zealand reserves the right to use the previous version of Article 7 taking into account its observations and reservations on that version (i.e. the version included in the Model Tax Convention immediately before the 2010 update of the Model Tax Convention) because it does not agree with the approach reflected in Part I of the 2010 Report Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments. It does not, therefore, endorse the changes to the Commentary on the Article made through that update.'

The current MTC version of Article 7 will only apply if and when it is adopted in New Zealand’s DTAs. This is unlikely to occur in the near future. The DTAs renegotiated subsequent to the 2010 revision do not include Article 7. Australia has also reserved the right to use the pre-2010 MTC version of Article 7.

The relevant MTC commentary in interpreting New Zealand’s DTAs is therefore the commentary as it read immediately before 22 July 2010, taking into account our reservations and observations. This commentary is found in the annex to the MTC commentary on Article 7.

A New Zealand observation made in this version of the commentary notes that New Zealand does not agree with the approach reflected in Part I of the 2008 Report Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments, an earlier version of the authorised OECD approach. New Zealand does not agree with the amendments made to the commentary that adopt the conclusions of that report such as, for example, the concept of allocating free capital.

Legal position of PEs
---------------------

A PE is not legally distinct from the rest of the enterprise the same way a separate legal entity is legally distinct from other enterprises within the same multinational group.

For transactions between separate legal entities, the determination of which enterprise owns assets, which bears risks and which possesses capital is determined by legally binding contracts or other confirmed legal arrangements. The legal position for a PE is quite different - there is no single part of an enterprise which legally owns the assets, assumes risks, possesses the capital or enters into contracts with separate legal entities. There are no legal transactions between different parts of a single entity - the now familiar limited risk structuring between separate legal entities has no legal meaning within a single legal entity.

General principles of attribution
---------------------------------

The starting point in any attribution exercise is the financial statements of the New Zealand PE determined by the ordinary processes of good business accountancy. They should be a fair reflection of the real economic functions performed and the assets utilised by the PE. A cross-check should be carried out by examining any internal documentation relating to the functional operation of the PE. Such documentation should describe the key functions performed and assets used in the PE’s business operations.

The internal transfer of goods and/or services may be recognised at full market prices provided the goods and/or services are of the same kind as those which the enterprise would normally sell to third parties. Trading stock may be transferred by a head office to its PE at cost plus a normal mark-up. An appropriate profit element is acceptable, measured by reference to the arm’s-length standard.

For other expenditure, the amount to be taken into account as incurred for the purposes of the PE’s taxation position is limited to the actual costs with no profit element added - notional sums are not deductible. The following issues commonly arise.

*   General management/administration/support services - these should be allocated on an actual cost basis only (no mark-ups).
*   Guarantee fees - a deduction is not available as no credit risk happens within a single enterprise (you cannot guarantee yourself).
*   Research and development - part of an actual cost basis may be appropriate where the PE is a direct beneficiary of the research and development and makes use of the intangible created.
*   Royalties - as there is only one legal entity, it is not possible to allocate legal ownership of intangible rights to any particular part of the single enterprise. However, if a third party charges a royalty for the specific use of intellectual property by the PE, then this cost may be allocated accordingly.

The transfer of capital against the payment of interest and an undertaking to repay in full at a future date does not fit with the true legal nature of a PE. Where no business of banking is involved, internally-charged interest is non-deductible to a PE apart from the cost of funds incurred when borrowed from third parties and used in the PE’s business (non-resident withholding tax or approved issuer levy would also apply in these circumstances).

Special considerations apply to payments of interest made by different parts of a financial enterprise to each other on advances. Making and receiving advances are closely related to the ordinary business of such enterprises so market interest rates are acceptable.

Finally, a general reasonableness check is required to ensure the profit calculated as being linked to the PE is in line with that which would be expected from a comparable business operating entirely at arm’s-length. This is subject to the particular deductibility restrictions outlined above. The OECD transfer pricing guidelines, while not directly applicable, are of general assistance in this regard.

Domestic rules for branches
---------------------------

Where there is an applicable DTA, New Zealand’s domestic profit attribution rules have been simplified so that only one set of PE profit attribution rules are applied. That is, the methodology which applies under the DTA should also be used in the domestic source rules.

In the absence of a DTA, only the domestic rules apply. Given the alignment between the DTA and domestic rules, it is not expected that there would be material differences in the amount of income apportioned to New Zealand under each approach.

The basic approach under the domestic rules is to identify and apportion income and expenditure to the New Zealand branch, ensuring the result of the exercise is an arm’s-length outcome. In doing so, expenditure must be incurred, ruling out any deductions for internal mark-ups (even for trading stock) and notional payments.

You have asked for us to undertake modelling of the distributional impacts of GST and income tax combined. 2. The purpose of this briefing note is to confirm and clarify your request and set out some existing work on this issue. 3. We also attach the first draft of the first 10 chapters of the High-Wealth Individuals Research Project report, which was sent for peer review this week. The paper is being reviewed by Associate Professor Peer Skov and Professor Craig Elliffe. Existing analysis 4. We understand that you are wishing to have more information on how progressive the tax system is when both income tax and GST are considered. When determining progressivity, it is useful to consider both the tax and transfer system together, given the significant role the transfer system has in redistributing income. Page 3 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] studies have noted that, over a lifetime, income taxes will appear less progressive and consumption taxes (e.g. GST) will appear less regressive than annual measures. 2 9. For GST, this is because high-income individuals tend to save a higher portion of their income than low-income individuals. This results in lower expenditure relative to income, and therefore a lower GST-income ratio. If these individuals later spend their savings, for example in retirement, they will then have a high GST-income ratio at that point in their lives. The GST-income ratio is therefore significantly impacted by life-cycle effects. As an example, many of the people in deciles 1 and 2 of income may be borrowing (e.g. students) or “dissaving” (e.g. retirees spending previously accumulated wealth). For these people, a high GST to income ratio may be seen as entirely appropriate given at other periods of their life they paid a low GST to income ratio. 10. An alternative way to analyse the impact of GST is to measure the impact of GST on poverty, as has been done by Alastair Thomas. 3 In his analysis, Thomas finds that consumption taxes increase the number of individuals below the poverty line by three percentage points on average in the OECD countries studied. Final Income 11. Another approach that assesses the overall redistributive impacts of the tax and transfer system, and accounts for the impact of indirect taxation, is looking at final income. 12. Final income is disposable income (market income less income tax plus government cash transfers) plus the cost of in-kind social services received (health and education), and less indirect tax paid. It can be interpreted as a proxy for the economic resources available to households and is a more complete measure than disposable income, or the tax to income ratio, of the redistributive effects of government. 13. This has been studied by Aziz et al in 2012. 4 The graph below shows the average cost of income support and health and education expenditure, less tax (income plus GST) payments per household for each decile. This reveals the net impact of government redistribution on households’ economic well-being. In the four time periods studied, deciles 1 to 5 received more government spending on the social services included in this study than they paid in taxes. 2 Fullerton, D., & Rogers, D. L. (1991).

Both the Treasury effective tax rate project and the HWI project will include analysis with GST. Both these projects will look at effective tax rates including income tax and GST relative to economic income. Measuring economic income, as opposed to taxable income, allows us to assess the progressivity of the tax system against the change in economic resources available across households. 15. Preliminary results from this analysis will be made available to you later this year. 16. The Treasury is also undertaking a project to analyse final income across the income distribution, similar to the work discussed above by Aziz. In addition to looking at income tax, this work uses HES 2019 data to calculate the mean value of indirect tax (GST and excise tax on tobacco and alcohol) by income group and also accounts for government in-kind transfers. Taking account of the time needed to clear this data through Stats NZ, Treasury expect this work to be available early next year. 17. While we can also update the graph above for income tax and GST across taxable or HES income deciles, in the short term this will need to be based off aggregate data (HES median household income per decile) rather than through Treasury’s micro simulation model. Aggregate data will be less accurate than micro simulation data and will miss certain factors such as tax credits. Therefore, this is likely to provide less accurate information than the above.

At your meeting with officials on 2 May, you asked for additional information on the following related to the High-Wealth Individuals (HWI) effective tax rate report: • Examples of ways we tax unrealised income; • Analysis of ownership patterns (we will provide this later); • Rate of return information for project population; and • A simple explanation for why unrealised gains are income. 2. We also update you on recent comments by Thomas Piketty on the report. Comments by Thomas Piketty 3. In a podcast broadcast by French radio on 28 April, Thomas Piketty referred to the HWI report during a debate about a French website that discloses where tax revenues are raised and how French taxes are spent. 4. His comments related to the HWI report were: • Transparency is good but the French website lacks details. He noted that in contrast, New Zealand just released a study showing tax distribution across the income and wealth distribution (referring to the Treasury study), and also the 300 wealthiest New Zealand families paid only 8% of their income in tax (note Page 2 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] the actual figure is about 9%), while the average for New Zealanders is about 20%. • According to recent media releases, the wealthiest Americans pay about 4% (we presume he is referring to the Council of Economic Advisors study we cited in our report – that figure was about 8%). • He indicated he believed the equivalent figure for the wealthiest French is probably about the same as for the Americans. He encouraged the French government to do a similar study as our HWI study, using the 300 or 500 wealthiest French. 5. In earlier comments to Radio NZ, he described the New Zealand reports as “depressing but not surprising” and said the obvious solution was a progressive wealth tax at the top. Unrealised income 6. Measuring income on an accrual or unrealised basis is common for many purposes. For example, it is standard for business financial statements to be prepared on an accrual basis, because this is a fairer presentation of income over a period than on a realised or cash-flow basis. 7. The tax system uses a combination of cash-flow and accrual measures. Cash-flow is often used for simplicity and certainty and in many cases there is very little difference between a cash-flow and accrual measure (such as for wages and salaries). 8. Examples where the tax system measures income on an accrual instead of cash- flow basis include: • Financial arrangements (debt instruments) – the financial arrangement rules (income and expense from debt) primarily require an accrual measure of income. For example, loan income or expense must be calculated on a yield-to- maturity basis and/or the change in value of the debt instrument over the year must be included. Some debt instruments may be measured on a cash-flow basis for simplicity when the value is small (such as bank deposits). • Foreign investment funds (FIFs) – FIFs are generally portfolio interests in foreign shares. Under the FIF rules, the primary calculation method is the fair dividend rate, a deemed 5% return regardless of the realised income (such as dividends) from the shares. An alternative measure is comparative-value, which is also an accrual measure (the unrealised gain or loss must be taken into account, although to reduce arbitrage there is a limit to recognising the loss). • Depreciation loss – when durable personal property is used to produce income, an annual deduction is allowed for an accrued depreciation loss. When the property is sold, gain or loss must be recognised so that the total deductions claimed equal the actual loss. Rate of return information 9. You asked for rate of return information. The following tables some high-level indicative returns for total economic income, and only non-taxable economic income: Page 5 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 1.

The following table compares the effective tax rates and tax under the statutory personal and trustee tax rates that applied over the Project period with estimated effective tax rates and tax had the 39% personal tax rate applied on personal taxable income over $180,000 over the period, and a trustee tax rate of 39% applied over the period. 2. It shows the average ( weighted mean) effective tax rate and absolute tax value for personal and trustee income and tax for the responder population families. Trustee income and tax include both trading and non-trading trusts. 3. The all-income ETR is re-estimated using the 39% tax rate. For the all-income ETR, income does not include imputed rent. Tax includes personal, trustee and company tax (shown in the aggregate tax figure) but does not include GST. 4. These revenue calculations are static and do not incorporate behavioural changes resulting from a change in tax rates. For example, trading trusts could convert to companies if a 39% trustee rate applied. 5. The tax figures are higher than those provided in BN2023/159, as trading trusts are included in these figures.

The following shows the proportion of wealth by asset class, as at June 30, for the responder population. This is measured on a responder population family basis. 7. Wealth data is estimated at 30 June for 2015, 2018 and 2021 and interpolated for 30 June 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020. 8. Wealth is estimated from survey information, calculated data (such as unlisted entity values), and from public information (non-portfolio listed company shares). No personal debt is presumed to be associated with the wealth except with respect to real property. A debt level for non-owner-occupied real property was assumed based on HES data for debt levels for the nearest year for the top ventile of the HES sample and survey data was used for mortgages on owner-occupied housing. 9. Property is directly held and trust property, including property owned by land-rich entities ; portfolio is directly held and trust portfolio assets; and business is non- portfolio listed companies owned by individuals and trusts, unlisted companies owned by individuals and trusts (other than land-rich companies), and trading trusts. 10. For the share of wealth, that is the share of wealth as a proportion of the total investment wealth in the listed categories. It is not a share of the total wealth that includes personal assets of the family (such as cars).

Following is the weighted average rate of return by asset class calculated for the Project population, by tax year. The assets classes align to those used in the report. 12. Rates of return are calculated as income for the asset category / asset base. 13. Income figures for each asset class are taken from the report, modified as stated in this paragraph. Income elements included in taxable income are not included unless stated. Property income includes capital gains and taxable income from land- rich entities but does not include rent except for properties owned by land-rich companies. Business income includes capital gains from directly held unlisted and listed companies and trading trusts and businesses held in trust. Portfolio income includes directly and indirectly (held in trust) held portfolios, as well as personal interest, dividends, and overseas income that were taxable to the individual or trust (this may include dividends on non-portfolio entities 1 ). 14. The total income and rate of return recorded below is slightly different to the all- economic income rate of return provided in BN 2023/15 as in that note, all - economic income includes base income and trustee income. In this calculation, base income and trustee income is only included to the extent it is clearly allocable to an asset class (interest, dividends and overseas income are allocated to portfolio income). 1 In that case, those dividends should technically be allocated to business income, but it is not possible to distinguish those in the data from portfolio dividends, so all dividends are allocated to portfolio income.

The purpose of this note is to inform the Minister of the direction Inland Revenue is taking on the length of historic information collected from high wealth individuals (HWI). Summary 2. Inland Revenue intends that this information is collected for a six -year period, specifically, income years 2016 to 2021 inclusive. 3. In terms of broad research interest, a long dataset would be desired for the wealth project. However, there are a number of issues that make data collection from a large number of years impractical and would significantly increase the risks associated with the project: a. b. Going back further periods also significantly increases the size and complexity of the project, particularly in regard to obtaining data on a defined population. s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(h) Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 4.A listed company workstream is underway which attempts to consider specific taxpayers whose net worth is largely based on their controlling interest in listed companies. This will provide a longer time horizon for considering effective tax rates from economic income. 5.The purpose of this wealth project is to understand the tax related contribution of HWI family groups from their economic income, measured by an effective tax rate (ETR). We are intending to provide the Minister with a report on the ETRs of the high wealth group in June 2023. 6.A longer time series of economic income and tax paid, would provide deeper information, however there are significant constraints that limit how practical it is for Inland Revenue to collect this information in the time available. Further practical constraints with longer information collection 11.The longer the period of information collection, the more complex the internal collation and analysis will be. This increases the risk that the project cannot be delivered in 2023. 12.Customers are also unlikely to hold information longer than the minimum required retention period of income year 2016. As a result, the information response rate is likely to be poor for years earlier than this period. Conclusion 13. Inland Revenue is intending to collect information for a period of 6 years (TY16-21 inclusive). As this information is being collected in 2022, undertaking the historical collection for 7 years prior to 2022 leaves a maximum of 6 years of collection. For the 2021 year to be included, the collection would need to take place no earlier than April 2022. s 9(2)(h) s 9(2)(h) s 9(2)(h) Page 3 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Additional workstream for calculating ETRs 14. As the information collection exercise will be limited to 6 years, an additional approach is being taken which utilises internal and public data to generate ETRs from a smaller sample of high wealth individual’s economic income for a longer horizon where this is practical. 15. This workstream will be similar in nature to past work completed by Inland Revenue in 2015-16 who investigated (largely qualitatively) what exposure there is to taxation as wealth accumulates. The 2019 Tax Working Group recommended within their final report that this type of analysis is regularly repeated. 16. This workstream aims to estimate the economic income and effective tax paid from a subset of the HWI population who hold a substantial amount of their wealth in publicly listed companies. Only administrative data and external data (i.e. publicly available data or data previously sourced from third parties) will be used for this longer horizon workstream. This will consider at least 20 years of historic data. 17. Furthermore, Treasury is intending to extend the work it is doing on wealth distribution through use of the capitalisation method back to 2001. Consultation 18.

The Minister of Revenue has asked us to explain the treatment of related persons in the High Wealth Individuals (HWI) research project, and how and why it differs from the treatment of associated persons in the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA). Discussion General reasons for associated person rules in the ITA 2. Special rules regarding related persons (called “associated persons” in the ITA) are used for a number of purposes in the ITA. Some of these are: Deeming transactions done by an associated person to be done by the taxpayer 3. For reasons of certainty, and in order to reduce tax avoidance opportunities, the ITA has provisions which deem a transaction done by an associated person to be done by the taxpayer or taxed in a similar way. One example of this is deeming a company distribution made to an associated person of the taxpayer/shareholder to be made to the taxpayer/shareholder when it results in a dividend. Ignoring transactions done between associated persons 4. Transactions that could give rise to a tax benefit may be ignored when done between associated persons in order to prevent such transactions being done primarily for tax reasons. An example of this is a sale of depreciable property to an Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] associated person for a non-taxable capital gain may not give rise to a higher tax depreciation base to the extent of the non-taxable capital gain amount. Combining interests owned by associated persons to determine if tax thresholds apply 5. Some tax rules provide that certain tax treatments may not apply if the taxpayer owns more than a certain amount of asset. In order to prevent such thresholds being defeated by dividing holdings among associated persons, the amounts held by associates may be aggregated in applying the threshold. An example of this is a rule for portfolio investment entities (PIEs) that no investor may own more than 20% of the fund. This requires interests of investors who are associated with each other to be aggregated to determine if the threshold is breached. Categories of associated persons 6. The ITA has the following categories of associated persons: • Relatives – persons within two degrees of blood relationship (parents, grandparents; children, grandchildren; siblings), and marriage and de facto partners; • Companies – two or more companies with at least 50% common voting (or similar) ownership; • Company and non-corporate shareholder – a company and a person owning at least 25% of the company; • Trusts – settlors, trustees appointers and beneficiaries are associated in different ways with each other. 7. The associated person provisions are broad, and when they are used they are often limited as some relationships may not be relevant for different provisions. Related persons for the wealth project 8. The High Wealth Individuals survey and methodology does not have a central definition of related persons. Instead, treatment of related persons is incorporated into the general approach. The principles followed were designed for the purposes of the project, rather than the factors outlined above, therefore with an eye to economic rather than tax-based relationships. 9. The most important of these are: • Family; • In-scope disclosed trusts; and • In-scope entities. Family 10. Family members are defined as the high wealth individual, their domestic partner, and dependent children. “Family” is used as the unit analysis in addition to individuals (similar to “household” used for similar analyses). “Family” is also used to aggregate interests of family member to determine if the ownership threshold for an in-scope entity is met. “Family” is narrower than the concept of relatives in the ITA associated persons provision, in that adult relatives are not included, similar to international statistical precedents for defining a household. Page 3 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Trusts 11. Trusts must be disclosed when their income could be relevant to determining the effective tax rate (ETR) of an HWI or member of their household (family). A trust must be disclosed if a family member is a settlor, appointer or beneficiary of the trust, and the trust meets the materiality threshold (at least $1 million of gross assets). This is similar to the broad approach towards determining when a trust is an associated person in the ITA. Entities 12. Entities (mostly companies) must be separately disclosed when they are material in assets and control relative to the household (family). This means, their gross assets are at least $1 million, and they are at least 10%-owned by family members (either directly or indirectly see below). In determining this, ownership interests of the family members are aggregated, together with ownership interests of disclosed trusts in the entity. This is broader than the shareholder test used in the ITA for associated persons. That requires a 25% ownership threshold, while this is 10%. That is because the ITA is concerned with transactional control of the company, while the 10% test is concerned with materiality to the ETR calculations and availability of information for the disclosure. 13. There is also an analogue to the concept of two or more companies being associated with each other, in that the HWI survey requires disclosure of indirect ownership of an entity (except an indirect interest in a partnership). This applies if that entity meets the asset requirement, and the 10% ownership requirement by tracing a chain of ownership through other entities up to a family member or disclosed trust. 14. Entities that do not meet these thresholds are included in the family’s porfolio assets. Felicity Barker Policy Lead s 9(2)(a)

At a meeting on 9 June, the Minister of Revenue asked how effective tax rates (ETRs) will be calculated for the High Wealth Individual Research Project (the Project), and specifically how GST would be treated. 2. This note responds to those questions. Effective Tax Rate calculation 3. Broadly speaking, individual effective tax rates are the amount of tax paid divided by income; 푇푇푇푇푇푇 푝푝푇푇푝푝푝푝 (푝푝푝푝푝푝 −푡푡 푇푇푇푇 푝푝푖푖푖푖푖푖푖푖푝푝) =퐸퐸퐸퐸퐸퐸. 4. Estimating an individual’s tax paid and income requires certain assumptions to be made. It is our intention, at a high level, to base both terms on the individual’s ability to consume at a point in time. The definition of e conomic income will be used in calculating income (denominator). Economic income is equal to the amount an individual could consume in one year and maintain the same amount of wealth. 1 This is distinct from taxable and realised income. 5. The purpose of this ETR measure is to represent an individual’s contribution to current government income from their ability to contribute (their ability to pay). At a point in time, the government requires income to pay for goods, services, and redistribution. The principles of ability to pay and equal sacrifice indicate that we 1 In practice, an individual’s wealth is not held constant and therefore a person’s actual consumption is added to their change in wealth (their potential consumption). s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) Page 2 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] would expect this ETR to rise with economic income, as those with high economic income have a greater ability to contribute and sacrifice relatively less from contributing. 6. Tax paid (numerator) will be attributed to the individual at the same proportion as income, 2 i.e. t he proportion of company income attributed to the individual will be used to calculate the amount of company tax attributed to the individual. Later in this note we explore the treatment of GST paid within the tax paid calculation. 7. Example: An individual owns 50% of Business A. Business A’s value increases by $100,000 in period 1. The individual is apportioned 50% of the income ($50,000). Business A paid $10,000 of tax in period 1. The individual will also be apportioned 50% ($5,000) of the tax paid. In this simple example the individual’s ETR would be $5000 $50000 =10%. 8. It is our desire to estimate an d report on a range of ETRs, relaxing certain assumptions. Although these are yet to be finalised, they are likely to include: • Trusts, Charities and Private Foundations: Changing which relationship determines the inclusion of trust net-assets and tax paid (settlors, appointees, trustees etc.). • GST: The inclusion and exclusion of GST paid. (See below) 9. Appendix 1 provides a simple example of how an individual’s economic income, tax paid and effective tax rate could be calculated. Treatment of GST Will GST be included within the ETR calculation? 10. GST will be included within the tax paid (numerator) but have no impact on income (denominator). Higher prices of goods and services leads to a reduction in the real consumption by the individual, thereby impacting the economic income of the individual. On these grounds, we plan on including GST paid within one of the ETR estimates. This will increase the effective tax rates for all individuals. 11. An ETR will also be provided where this assumption is relaxed, and no GST is included. How will the amount of GST be calculated? 12. The amount of GST apportioned to individuals will be calculated by multiplying the GST rate to an estimate of the individual’s gross expenditure. T he amount of GST apportioned to individuals is not recorded and therefore needs to be estimated. 13. The rationale is that this is (approximately) the GST paid by the individual at the point in time. As a result, it measures the individual’s contribution to fund current government expenditure. 14. Applying an estimate of GST paid based on consumption and not income more closely relates to what they contribute now. 2 The project will not seek to explore economic incidence of taxes or income further than attributing all of the company value and taxes to owners/shareholders at the proportion of their ownership share. Page 3 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 15. The amount of GST paid relative to income depends significantly on the savings or borrowings of an individual. An individual can, for a specific year, significantly reduce their GST liability relative to income by delaying consumption. Alternatively, an individual can significantly increase their GST liability relative to income by borrowing or by spending their savings/inheritance. 16. For individuals at different stages in their lifecycle this can have a significant impact on the timing of their tax paid – making the tax look more regressive than it is over the individual’s lifecycle. (See Appendix 2 fo r further analysis) 17. Figure 1 shows the average effective GST burden on households, ranked using income. 3 The blue line shows, through the use of savings, that high-income earners in a particular year pay an effective GST rate that is less than half of the statutory rate. We would expect as a high-income individual changes from wealth accumulation (working age) to wealth de -cumulation (retirement) that their annual effective tax rate would shift from 6.4% closer to 13.8%. 18. The black line shows that GST on expenditure is reasonably consistent across income deciles. Source: Data from Thomas (2020, p.47) 19.

Academic literature Mirrlees et al. (2011), ‘Tax by Design’: The Mirrlees Review, Oxford: Oxford Univer sity Press for Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS), (https://ifs.org.uk/publications/5353) “It can be misleading to look at current payments of all taxes as a percentage of current income: in general, a better guide to the lifetime distributional impact is to look at income taxes as a percentage of current income and expenditure taxes as a percentage of current expenditure. In the absence of data on whole lifetimes, snapshots of current income and expenditure must be used judiciously to give a rounded impression of the distributional impact of taxes.” Example To see why it can be misleading to look at current payments of all taxes as a percentage of current income, consider an extremely simple example. Suppose that a country consists of people who earn $100 of labour income (e.g., wages) in period 1 and spend half of this income while saving the rest. The amount saved earns interest at a rate of 10%. People spend what they have saved plus any after-tax interest in period 2. Consider four possibilities. Situation A. – No tax. In the absence of any tax, people would spend $50 in period 1 and save $50. In period 2 they would spend $55. Situation B. – Proportional. If we had tax at a rate of 20% on all income (labour plus interest income), they would earn $100 in period 1 and pay tax of $20 on this income. They would consume $40 and save $40. This would earn $4 of interest income on which $0.80 of tax would be paid. They would spend $43.2 in period 2. The tax would be proportional. Individuals in both period 1 and period 2 would be paying 20% of their incomes in tax. People in period 1 would be paying $20 on $100 of income and people in period 2 would be paying $0.80 on $4 of income. Situation C. – Progressive. Now suppose instead we have tax at a rate of 20% on labour income but not interest income. In this case people in period 1 would once more earn $100 in period 1 and pay tax of $20 and consume $40 and save $40. In period 2 they would earn $4 of interest on which no tax is paid and have consumption of $44. This would be a progressive tax. People in period 1 who are on a high income of $100 would be paying 20% of their income in tax. People in period 2 who are on a low income of $4 would be paying no tax. Those on higher incomes are paying high average rates of tax. Situation D. – Regressive? Finally suppose instead that we have a GST at a rate of 25% (and no tax on income). Once again people earn $100 of income in period 1 and spend half and save half. The $50 that is spent attracts $10 of GST so they end up consuming $40 of real goods and services. The GST is 25% of $40. They save the other $50 and this earns $5 of interest in period 2. They spend the $55 and pay $11 of GST which allows them to purchase $44 of real goods and services. Note that this leaves them with exactly the same consumption as people in situation C. But tax collected in period 1 is $10 which is a tax of 10% of their income. Tax collected in period 2 is $11 which is 220% of their income of $5. A very simple analysis of this case might suggest that this tax is regressive because it results in a very high tax rate on low incomes in period 2 and a much lower tax on the higher incomes in period 1. But it makes little sense to describe situation C as having a progressive tax system and situation D as having a regressive tax system. In both cases the same consumption possibilities are open to people. Page 8 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] A problem with expressing taxes like GST as a proportion of income being earned in particular periods is that measures of progressivity or regressivity would end up being influenced by the timing of when people choose to spend their incomes and the incomes they have at this time. As mentioned in the body of this briefing note, we intend to report on both bases.

You have asked for us to undertake modelling of the distributional impacts of GST. 2. This note provides you with information on work we are planning to do over May and the longer term. Inland Revenue intends to report to you on preliminary modelling work at the end of May. Further modelling (based on economic income) as part of the HWI Research Project and the Treasury analytical note series will be provided over 2022. Work in May 3. Work commenced and to be completed over May is as follows: i. We are undertaking work to model the ratio of GST/income and GST/expenditure, across income deciles, fo r both the 2016 and 2019 June years. 1 This work uses a similar methodology to the previous work by the OECD which you have seen. This work is: • Based on HES data on household income and expenditure; • Limited to providing results for the average of decile 1-10 (that is it does not provide results for the top 1% income earners, for example); 1 IRD modelling will be based on decile averages whereas Treasury work discussed later will use its microsimulation Tax and Welfare Analysis model (TAWA). A microsimulation model can be expected to be more accurate because GST exclusions are able to be applied at a finer level of detail. Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • Similar to OECD work, shows that the ratio of GST/disposable income declines with income, and shows a broadly proportional trend for GST/expenditure. ii. We intend to extrapolate these results to our high-wealth population, as a proxy of very high-income earners ( the mean and median high-wealth person in our population would be placed at the upper end of decile 10 in the HES income distribution). Our approach to estimating the GST burden of our high-wealth population is to: • Estimate the average expenditure of families in this cohort by taking the mean and median disposable income of the cohort (based on their taxable income) multiplied by an assumed rate of consumption relative to cash- based income. 2 • Multiply the estimated expenditure by an ‘effective GST rate’ to calculate the GST paid. The effective GST rate is the GST rate on total expenditure taking account of exempt and zero-rated goods. We will base the effective GST rate on evidence of the consumption basket of high-income or wealth individuals. • The amount of GST paid can then be used to calculate the GST/disposable income and GST/expenditure ratio of these individuals – which provides an approach comparable to the OECD approach – and an extrapolation of those results. • Note while disposable income (taxable income less tax) will be used to es timate the absolute amount of GST paid by the households, a ratio of GST can be calculated relative to disposable income or economic income. iii. As inputs into this modelling, we are also reviewing international literature on the following: • Literature on the ratio of consumption/income of very high-income or high- wealth individuals. In economics this is known as the average propensity to consume (consumption/income) and marginal propensity to consume (amount of last dollar of income consumed). This will be used to estimate the expenditure of high-wealth individuals based on their income. • Literature on the ‘consumption basket’ of very high-income or high-wealth individuals; that is what proportion of their total expenditure is spent on particular types of goods such as international travel. This will be used to estimate the ‘effective GST rate’ paid by very high-income or high-wealth individuals (i.e., if a high proportion of their expenditure is on exempt or zero rated good this will reduce their effective GST rate on total expenditure). Work over 2022 4. A number of additions to the above can be undertaken over 2022. These are: i. As part of the HWI research project, the June collection asks for an estimate of the average monthly expenditure of the high-wealth family (both including and excluding goods that attract GST). We can use this as a cross-check on the amount of GST-paid we estimated for the high-wealth individuals; ii. We also request information from which we can calculate the high-wealth individual’s savings. We can use this to estimate their expenditure, as a further cross-check on the calculation of GST paid. iii. When we have measures of economic income for the high-wealth project (expected late 2022/early 2023) we will be able to calculate the ratio of total tax 2 We consider the absolute amount of expenditure can be calculated based off a personal taxable income measure as individuals do not tend to spend all capital gains as accrued. Using economic income to estimate expenditure would on average result in a higher estimate of expenditure and GST (and lower regressivity). Page 3 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] (including GST) to economic income as well as the ratio of GST/economic income. iv. The Treasury work on effective average tax rates (EATRs) for decile 1-10 of the broader economic income distribution (based on HES) will allow a calculation of multiple taxes, including GST, by economic income. The Treasury will be able to decompose the effect of each tax that is included in this EATR, allowing readers to see the contribution made by personal income taxes, transfer payments, Portfolio Investment Entity taxes, local body rates and GST across the economic income distribution. This provides a comparator to the high wealth individuals work and is expected late 2022/early 2023. 5. We have also provided you with a draft of the Financial Collection. We will be finalising the questions in this draft over the next week, so that it can be sent in early June. We draw your attention in particular to paragraphs 37-42, on gifts and inheritance and expenditure. 6. We are available to discuss this note on 10 May.

The purpose of this note is to outline whether the High Wealth Individual (HWI) Research project population is representative of the Top 0.1% of the wealth distribution and the economic sectors they operate in. 2. The group that was selected for the project was based on environmental scanning undertaken by Inland Revenue over the past 20+ years. This environmental scanning involved monitoring large transactions or other indications that individuals had significant wealth holdings, using both public information and the departments tax data. This list was then curated to remove tax non-residents and deceased persons and define the population in a way consistent with household-based income analysis. 3. This selection is non-random, and as a result the sample is not expected to be representative of the population of all HWIs. This approach was taken as it is not possible to build a representative sample, since t here is no information available to determine the full population of HWIs to sample from. 4. As a result, there will be HWIs that are missing from the group, and there is no way to definitively state that the selected group is representative of the Top 0.1% of the wealth distribution. 5. However, the selected individuals are HWIs. As a result, the research project is focused on understanding the population of already identified HWIs in order to s9(2)(a) s9(2)(a) Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] construct information about economic measures of income and wealth for this group. 6. Understanding the asset and broad industry makeup of this group can help IRD form a view on how representative this group is. Furthermore, a richer understanding of the makeup of the group will allow IRD to indicate and correct for clear biases that may exist when comparing the income, wealth and tax paid by this group to the population generally. Sectoral representativeness 7. The extent to which this group is representative of different industry sectors can be tested by considering the main industry of each individual in the identified population, based on internal information, and the consequent sector shares of individuals in each industry sector. 8. As no information has been collected from individuals at present and given there isn’t available information about all HWIs, it is impossible to be definitive about the representativeness of asset classes, or industry of involvement, for the selected participants. 9. However, property and land-based industries are highly represented in the data – at higher rates than both the employment share and GDP share of these industries in the general economy. 10. Given this representation, the population selected for the wealth project will be able to provide insights relating to economic measures of income for those who have significant involvement in property and primary industries. 11. Figure 1 compares the share of GDP, employment, and the main activity of HWIs by high level economic sectors based on ANZSIC industries. To protect privacy, the classifications shown in the below graph is aggregated to the primary (raw materials), secondary (manufacturing and distribution), and tertiary (goods sales and services) sectors respectively. Property services is shown separately from other tertiary industries. Figure 1 12. If the activities of the HWI population were in proportion to the activities of the New Zealand population as a whole, then we would expect the share of individuals involved in these activities to be similar to either the employment or GDP share. Page 3 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 13. However, there are clear reasons why this should not be the case – given that there are certain activities (investment, property ownership) that would be expected to have greater involvement by those who accumulate significant wealth. 14. Figure 1 indicates that, relative to their employment and GDP shares, the property and primary sectors (which includes significant land holding activity) are disproportionately included in the wealth project population. As a result, there is less risk that these activities are underrepresented in the HWI population that has been selected for the project. 15. However, there are three primary limitations for this comparison: • The ANZSIC codes used are at a high level (level 1). As a result, the aggregation into primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors is relatively imprecise and these numbers are not comparable to the Stats NZ estimates of these economic sectors. • A significant minority of the HWI groups have not reported this information, and so has been excluded from analysis. • The data that has been used to analyse this population refers to the main activity reported by the taxpayer. This is a subjective description of a main activity, and so does not necessarily tell us about the magnitude of property or land holdings – or even necessarily represent how the individual’s activities would be viewed by an outside party. 16. Initial analysis of internal information suggests that a number of individuals report being involved in the tertiary investment sector, when the income generated by the entities they hold an interest in appears to be closer to other economic categories. This is part of the reason why the number reporting secondary economic sectors as their main activity is low. 17. In the information collection stage of the wealth project, further information about the nature of the entities connected to the HWIs, as well as the high-level asset make-up of those entities, will be collected – balancing the usefulness of the information with the increase in compliance costs associated with the request. This will allow us to form a clearer view of how property assets matter when evaluating measures of economic income and the related effective tax rates paid by HWIs. Consultation with Treasury 18. Treasury was informed about this briefing note. Matt Nolan Principal Policy Advisor s9(2)(a)
Bright-line property tax For residential property sold from 1 July 2024 IR1229 July 2024 The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. Introduction On 1 October 2015 the bright-line test was introduced applying to residential property bought and sold within a certain period of time (bright-line period). Since 2015, a number of changes have been made to the test. This guide explains: •how the bright-line test applies for residential property sold from 1 July 2024 •the exclusions for main home, business premises and farmland •rollover relief for ownership transfers of inherited property, relationship property and transfers between associated persons •what expenses you can deduct from this income for tax purposes •what bright-line income to include in your income tax return •what happens if you sell the property for a loss. This guide is not intended for people in the business of property speculating, dealing, developing or building who include property sales as business income in their income tax return. If you have purchased and sold several residential properties or you’re a commercial operator, we recommend you consult a tax agent. However, it’s still your responsibility to be aware of your tax obligations. For information on how the bright-line test applies to residential property sold before 1 July 2024, see our guide Bright-line property tax – IR1227. Note Properties affected by a North Island adverse weather event and purchased by the Crown or local authority are not taxable under the bright-line test.

The bright-line test also applies to New Zealand tax residents who buy and sell residential property overseas. Your intention or purpose for purchasing or selling the property is not relevant. Note There are other land taxing rules that should be considered before the bright-line test. You can use the Property tax decision tool on our website to work out if you need to pay tax on the sale of your property under the land taxing rules, including the bright-line test. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/bright-line Residential property Residential property includes: •land with a house on it •land the owner has an arrangement to build a house on •land the owner can build a house on under the district plan rules. Residential property does not include farmland or land used predominantly as business premises, unless it is a business providing accommodation in a dwelling that is not the owner's home. For more information, see Part 2 - Exclusions. Example Robert buys a section zoned for residential purposes in June 2024. He plans to build a home for his family. His situation changes and he sells the section in August 2025. Even though there is no house on the land at the time of sale, the bright-line test applies. Bright-line period The bright-line period begins with the bright-line start date and ends with the bright-line end date. For residential property sold on or after 1 July 2024, the bright-line test looks at whether your bright-line end date for the property is within 2 years of your bright-line start date. 6 ird.govt.nz Example Mia purchases a property with a bright-line start date of 5 January 2022, which she uses as a rental property. She sells the property on 27 July 2024. The bright-line end date for the property is after 1 July 2024. However, because it is more than 2 years after the bright-line start date, any profit on the sale is not taxable under the bright-line test. Note For property sold before 1 July 2024, the bright-line test works differently. For more information, see our guide Bright-line property tax – IR1227. Bright-line start and end dates For a standard purchase of property, the bright-line period starts from the date the transfer of the property’s legal title is registered to you under the Land Transfer Act 2017 (usually the settlement date). For a standard sale, the bright-line period ends when you enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell the property (even if some conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). Bright-line period Contract to purchase Date binding sale and purchase agreement entered into Registration of title for purchase Date of registration with Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) Contract to sell Date binding sale and purchase agreement entered into Transfer of title for sale Date of transfer with Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) Example Marie signs an agreement to buy a residential property on 19 March 2023 for short-stay accommodation. The transfer to Marie is registered on the title with LINZ on 17 May 2023. She decides to sell the property and signs an agreement on 26 July 2024. The transfer is registered on the title on 31 August 2024. The start date for the bright-line period is 17 May 2023 (the day the transfer to Marie is registered) and the end date is 26 July 2024 (the day the agreement for sale is entered into). There are other situations that do not follow the standard land sale process. For these situations, there are separate rules for when the bright-line period starts and ends. BRIGHT-LINE PROPERTY TAX7 Start date The table below shows various types of purchase and acquisition and the date the bright-line period starts for each. Type of purchase/acquisitionDate to use Standard purchase of a propertyDate the transfer of the property is registered to you with Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) (usually the settlement date) Subdivided land – property you have subdividedThe original date of registration for the undivided property Off the plans – property acquired relying on the completion of a land development or subdivision Date you entered into a sale and purchase agreement Change of trustee – land transferred from a trustee of a trust to another trustee of the trust Bright-line start date for the original trustee Joint tenancy converted to a tenancy in common or tenancy in common converted to a joint tenancy To the extent the person’s share in the land is unchanged, the bright-line start date for the land before the tenancy was converted Purchase where no registration happens before the sale date Date you acquired an interest in the property Freehold estate converted from a lease with a perpetual right of renewal Date you were first granted the leasehold estate Land outside New ZealandDate the transfer of the property is registered to you under foreign laws For more information on what start date to use, go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz and refer to Question we've been asked (QB) 17/02: Date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2-year bright-line test. 8 ird.govt.nz Subdivided land When land is subdivided, the start date for the bright-line period is the date the legal title for the undivided land was originally registered to the owner under the Land Transfer Act 2017. Example 1 May 2021 Title for residential land is registered to Bob 1 May 2022 Bob subdivides the land into 2 sections and builds a house on the second section 1 May 2025 Bob enters into an agreement to sell the second section to Carl Bright-line period The start date for the bright-line period is 1 May 2021 and the end date is 1 May 2025. Bob’s sale of the second section to Carl is not taxable under the bright-line test because the bright-line end date is not within 2 years of the bright-line start date. Bob has owned the property for more than 2 years. However, Bob may still need to consider whether any of the other land taxing rules apply. For more information go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz and refer to our Question we've been asked (QB) 18/16: Income tax – bright-line test – main home exclusions – sale of subdivided section. Off the plans A purchase off the plans occurs when a person enters into a contract to purchase a parcel of land being developed or subdivided. At the time the person enters into the contract, the title does not yet exist (as the land needs to be subdivided or developed before a separate title can be issued). The person agrees to be registered on the title once it exists. In this situation, an earlier start date for the bright-line period is used. The start date is the date the person enters into an agreement to buy the land. Example Bright-line period 2 July 2023 Denise enters into a contract to purchase land off the plans 1 September 2023 Title is registered to Denise 1 September 2024 Denise enters into a contract to sell 12 December 2024 Transfer of title for sale The bright-line test applies because the bright-line end date of 1 September 2024 (the date Denise entered into a contract to sell) is within 2 years of the bright-line start date 2 July 2023 (the date Denise entered into a contract to buy the property off the plans). Any profit on the sale is taxable. BRIGHT-LINE PROPERTY TAX9 Freehold estate converted from a lease with a perpetual right of renewal When a person has a lease with a perpetual right of renewal which they then convert into freehold land, the start date for the bright-line period is the date the person is first granted the lease. This is consistent with other tax provisions that treat a lease with a perpetual right of renewal similar to freehold estates. Example 1 July 2023 Kelly obtains lease with perpetual right of renewal 1 January 2024 Kelly enters into agreement to acquire the land freehold 1 March 2024 Registration of title for freehold purchase 1 August 2024 Kelly enters into agreement to sell the land 1 September 2024 Registration of title for sale Bright-line period The start date for Kelly’s bright-line period is 1 July 2023 (the date the lease with perpetual right of renewal was first granted) and the end date is 1 August 2024 (the date she entered into an agreement to sell the land). Any profit made by Kelly on the sale of the land is taxable under the bright-line test because the bright-line end date is within 2 years of the bright-line start date. Contract with purchaser and/or nominee Often when someone enters into a contract to buy land, the person is named as the purchaser and/ or nominee. Before settlement, the person may choose to nominate someone else to complete the purchase, for example a family trust. In this situation, the bright-line period starts for the nominee on the date the transfer of title is registered to them (this typically happens on the settlement date). If there is no registered transfer of the land, the bright-line period will start on the date they were nominated as purchaser. This situation will not give rise to any potential bright-line implications for the nominator (the original named purchaser). This is because the nominator does not transfer their interest in the land to the nominee when they make the nomination (there is no disposal). When the legal title is transferred to the nominee, the nominator’s interest in the land simply ceases to exist, it is not disposed of. 10 ird.govt.nz Example 1 January 2024 Andrew enters into agreement to purchase land. Under the agreement, title to the land is to be given to Andrew or his nominee 1 February 2024 Andrew nominates his family trust as the person to acquire the property 1 March 2024 Registered title is transferred to the family trust 1 January 2025 The family trust enters into an agreement to sell land to Carl Bright-line period Andrew acquired an interest in the land (the right to purchase the land) on 1 January 2024 (the date he entered into the sale and purchase agreement). The nomination of the family trust as purchaser does not give rise to any bright-line implications for Andrew. This is because Andrew did not transfer his interest in the land to the family trust when he made the nomination, so there is no disposal of land by him. On settlement when legal title transferred to the family trust, Andrew’s interest in the land ceased to exist and it was not disposed of. The bright-line period starts on 1 March 2024 for the family trust which is the day legal title to the property is registered to the trust. End date The table below shows various types of sales and disposals and the date to use for the bright-line end date. This can include situations where a property is disposed of but there is no agreement in place to dispose of it. If more than 1 type of sale or disposal applies, then use the earliest date for your bright-line end date. Type of sale/disposalDate to use Standard sale of a property Date you entered into a sale and purchase agreement Gifting of propertyDate the gift was made Compulsory acquisition by the Crown, a local authority or a public authority Date of compulsory acquisition Mortgagee saleDate the property is disposed of by or for the mortgagee because the mortgagor defaulted (usually the settlement date) Disposals not covered aboveDate you disposed of the property BRIGHT-LINE PROPERTY TAX11 Gifts For gifts, the end date for the bright-line period is the date the person makes the gift of the residential property. This is the date you have done everything necessary to transfer the property to the new owner. This means for a gift of residential property, it is generally the date the interest is registered to the new ow ner. Example 1 May 2025 Title is registered to Helen (purchase price $400,000) 1 January 2026 Helen says she will gift the land to Ian 1 February 2027 Helen registers the transfer of land to Ian (market value $450,000) Bright-line period The start date for the bright-line period for Helen is 1 May 2025 (the date title is registered to Helen) and the end date is 1 February 2027 (the date title is transferred to Ian). Helen’s disposal of the land will be taxed under the bright-line test because she disposed of the land by gifting it to Ian within 2 years of the bright- line start date. Under ordinary tax rules, gifts of land are treated as if they are transferred at market value. As a result, Helen is deemed to have transferred the land to Ian at market value and $50,000 is taxable. 12 ird.govt.nz Part 2 - Exclusions A property will not be taxed under the bright-line test if you meet one of the following exclusions: •it’s your main home and your use meets the criteria •it’s used predominantly as business premises •it’s being used as farmland or capable of being used as farmland. Main home Your main home is the property where you live for most of the time. You cannot have more than 1 main home. If you have more than 1 property, your main home is the property you have the greatest connection with. This depends on: •the amount of time you live in each home •where your immediate family (if any) lives •where your personal property is kept •where your social ties are strongest •your use of each home •what other ties (for example employment, business and economic) you have with the surrounding community. Example Lisa rents an apartment in Wellington, where she lives with her son. The apartment is close to her office from where she runs her consulting business. She is a member of a local tramping club and is on the Board of Trustees of her son’s local school. She owns a house on Lake Taupō with views over the lake that she does not rent out when she is not using it. She spends 5 weeks with her son in this property over Christmas and New Year and also uses the property for 4 weekends during the ski season. When Lisa sells the Lake Taupō property, she cannot use the main home exclusion because it is not her main home. It is not the property she had the greatest connection with. For more information go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz and refer to Question we've been asked (QB) 24/01: If a person has two or more homes, which home is their main home for the purpose of the main home exclusion to the bright-line test? BRIGHTāLINE PROPERTY TAX13 Main home exclusion You can claim the main home exclusion if you: •used more than 50% of the property’s area as your main home (including the yard, gardens, and garage) •lived in the property as your main home for more than 50% of the bright-line period. If either one of these is less than 50%, then the main home exclusion does not apply and you will need to pay tax on any profit when you sell the property. Note For properties sold before 1 July 2024, different criteria apply depending on when you acquired the property. For more information, see our guide Bright-line property tax – IR1227. Area of land usage To be a 'main home', more than 50% of the area of the land must have been used. To calculate this, you need to consider all areas including the yard, gardens and garage. In some circumstances, you will be required to determine the area of land used for your private residential purposes and the area of land used for other purposes. For example, when a single property has been used by you partly as a residential home and partly as a rental property, you will need to determine the relative areas of each. In some cases, you may have determined the relative areas in working out any tax deductions you can claim for example, insurance and rates. Example Mele owns a property which is 600m 2 . The property includes a house (500m 2 ) and a fenced off flat (100m 2 ). She lives in the flat and the house is rented out. The main home exclusion does not apply because Mele is living in the flat which is 100m 2 and less than 50% of the total property area. Example In February 2024, Pinky buys a country store that has living quarters attached. She resides in the living quarters and runs a retail business from the front of the property. She calculates that the retail business uses 45% of the property and claims expenses (insurance and rates) on that basis against the retail income. Pinky sells the property and cannot use the business premises exclusion as the land is not used predominantly for her retail business. However, Pinky can use the main home exclusion if she sells the property within the bright-line period because she has lived in it as her main home for 55% of the bright-line period. 14 ird.govt.nz Living in your main home You must have lived in the property as your main home. Having the intention to use the property as your main home is not enough. The exclusion also does not apply when only a family member (and not you) has lived in the property as their main home. The property must have been lived in as your main home for more than 50% of the bright-line period. However, the property does not need to have been used without interruption as your main home. For example, a main home can be rented out for short periods while you are on holiday or before settlement of the sale of the property, as long as the total time it was used as your main home is more than the total time it was not used as your main home. Example Kate buys a residential property with a bright-line start date of 28 March 2023. She lives in the property as her main home for 14 months. She then rents the property out for 4 months prior to selling it. The bright-line end date is 20 September 2024. Kate can claim the main home exclusion and any profit on the sale will not be taxable under the bright-line test. This is because Kate lived in the property as her main home for more than 50% of the bright-line period. Example – Main home exclusion applies – Land area used and lived in for more than 50% 19 April 2023 Mel enters into a contract to purchase a property 20 May 2023 Title is registered to Mel 15 June 2023 Mel moves into the property 30 June 2024 Mel moves out and rents the property 30 December 2024 Mel enters into a contract to sell the property 8 January 2025 Transfer of title for sale Bright-line period 590 days Vacant for 26 daysLived in for 381 daysRented for 183 days On 19 April 2023, Mel enters into an agreement to purchase a property. Title is transferred to Mel on 20 May 2023. Mel lives in the property from 15 June 2023 to 30 June 2024. On 30 December 2024, Mel enters into an agreement to sell the property and the title is transferred to the new owner on 8 January 2025. The bright-line period is 590 days, starting on 20 May 2023 and ending on 30 December 2024. Mel lives in the property for 381 days, using it as her main home 65% of the time during the brightline period (381 / 590 days). The main home exclusion applies because Mel has used all of the property as her main home for more than 50% of the bright-line period. Any profit on the sale is not taxable under the bright-line test. BRIGHT-LINE PROPERTY TAX15 Example – Main home exclusion does not apply – Land area used more than 50% and lived in for less than 50% 20 April 2024 Ari enters into a contract to purchase a property 20 May 2024 Title is transferred to Ari 15 June 2024 Ari moves into the property 28 February 2025 Ari moves out and rents the property 30 December 2025 Ari enters into a contract to sell the property 8 January 2026 Transfer of title for the sale Bright-line period 590 days Vacant for 26 daysLived in for 259 daysRented for 305 days On 20 April 2024, Ari enters into an agreement to purchase a property. Title to the property is transferred to Ari 20 May 2024. Ari lives in the property from 15 June 2024 to 28 February 2025. On 30 December 2025, Ari enters into an agreement to sell the property and the title is transferred to the new owner on 8 January 2026. The bright-line period is 590 days, starting on 20 May 2024 and ending on 30 December 2025. Ari lives in the property for 259 days, using it as her main home 44% of the bright-line period (259/590 days). The main home exclusion does not apply because the property is used by Ari as her main home for less than 50% of the bright-line period. Ari’s profit on the sale is taxable. Main home held in trust A residential property held in trust can use the main home exclusion if the property sold was the main home of a beneficiary of the trust and 1 of the following apply: •the principal settlor does not have a main home, or •it is the main home of the principal settlor of the trust that is being sold. If a principal settlor of a trust has a main home that is not the one being sold by the trust, the main home exclusion cannot apply to any property owned by the trust. Who is a principal settlor? A principal settlor is the person who has provided the greatest (or equal greatest) value to the trust based on the market value of settlements on the trust. The principal settlor is a different concept from the settlor recorded in the Trust Deed. The principal settlor will need to be established by examining the settlements for the trust. For the purposes of determining a principal settlor, all provisions of value are counted except for the provision of services at below market value. If there are multiple people who have provided the equal greatest value to the trust, they are all considered principal settlors. 16 ird.govt.nz In addition, a person is not a principal settlor if they have provided an unconditional 'no-strings attached' gift to the trust. A transfer of value will also be disregarded unless that transfer is by: •a beneficiary •a trustee •a person with the power of appointment or removal of trustees •a person with a contingent interest in the trust property, in the case that the trust fails, or •a decision-maker under the trust. Example According to a Trust Deed, Joe and Anna are trustees and their children are beneficiaries of the trust. The settlor of the trust was Rangi, who provided $10 to settle the trust. Joe and Anna settled $500,000 on the trust, to be managed with in accordance with the terms of the trust deed. The trust later purchased a property. Joe and Anna lived in the property with their children until it was sold a year later. By settling $500,000 on the trust Joe and Anna became the principal settlors of the trust, even though they are not recorded as settlors on the Trust Deed. The property sold by the trust was the main home of the principal settlors of the trust and the beneficiaries of the trust, and therefore the main home exclusion applies. Example Aaron has 2 properties, a family home which he lives in, and a student flat which his son lives in while studying. Aaron settles the student flat in a trust and makes his son a discretionary beneficiary of the trust. The trust cannot use the main home exclusion because Aaron, the principal settlor of the trust, has another main home. Limits to claiming the main home exclusion The main home exclusion does not apply when you: •have a regular pattern of either buying and selling or building and selling your main home (even if you live in the property before it is sold) •have already used the main home exclusion twice over the 2-year period immediately before you sold. Regular pattern If you (either alone or with a group of persons) have a regular pattern of either buying and selling or building and selling your main home, you cannot claim the main home exclusion even if you live in the property before it is sold. This means you will need to pay tax under the bright-line test on any profit made. Determining whether there is a regular pattern can be complex. If you have purchased and sold several properties we recommend you seek advice from a tax advisor. BRIGHTāLINE PROPERTY TAX17 For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 33, No 6 (July 2021) page 22 and Question we've been asked (QB) 16/07: Income tax – Land sales rules, main home and residential exclusions, regular pattern of acquiring and disposing, or building and disposing at taxtechnical.ird. govt.nz Claiming the exclusion twice in 2 years You can only use the main home exclusion twice in 2 years. If you sell your main home within the bright- line period and you have already claimed the exclusion twice in the 2-year period immediately before you sold, you will need to pay tax under the bright-line test. Example PropertyBright-line period start – registration of title for purchase Bright-line period end – date sale and purchase agreement entered into Title transfer for sale 126 July 20237 November 20237 December 2023 27 December 20239 June 202423 July 2024 323 January 202515 July 20254 August 2025 Emma has purchased and sold 3 properties and lived in all of them the entire time of the bright-line period. Both properties 1 and 2 were sold within the bright-line period. Emma claimed the main home exclusion for properties 1 and 2 and therefore the bright-line test did not apply to the sale of these 2 properties. The bright-line period for properties 1 and 2 ended on 7 November 2023 and 9 June 2024 respectively. Emma enters into an agreement to sell property 3 on 15 July 2025. As of 15 July 2025, Emma had already claimed the main home exclusion on 2 previous occasions within 2 years of 15 July 2025 (7 November 2023 and 9 June 2024). This means she is unable to claim the main home exclusion for property 3. Any profit on the sale of property 3 is taxable under the bright-line test. Using the main home exclusion for 2 properties If you own 2 properties at the same time, it is possible to use the exclusion for both properties, but you can only do this for 1 property at a time. An example is when you live in 1 house as your main home and then you move into a new house while trying to sell the first property. The original house may satisfy the requirements to be your main home for the period before moving into the new house. The new house may also satisfy the requirements to be your main home for the subsequent period. The ownership overlap of the properties does not mean the original house fails to satisfy the requirements to be a main home for the period you own it. If you sell both properties within the bright- line period, you are able to use the main home exclusion for both properties (if they both satisfy the requirements to be your main home for the different periods). 18 ird.govt.nz Example Amy purchases a property in Napier on 1 February 2025 and moves in. She decides the house is too small and puts it on the market. She buys another, larger house on 31 October 2025 and moves in immediately. In November 2025 Amy is promoted to a role in Auckland. She puts the second property on the market and they both sell on 31 December 2025. 1 February 2025 Amy purchases property 1 31 December 2025 Amy sells property 1 Main home 31 October 2025 Amy moves out of property 1 31 December 2025 Amy sells property 2 Main home 31 October 2025 Amy purchases property 2 The main home exclusion is available for both of Amy’s properties. Property 1 was the main home for 9 of the 11 months of the bright-line period. Property 2 was the main home for the entire time of the bright-line period. Rollover relief and main home exclusion If rollover relief applies, any period of time a property is used as a main home by the original owner is also attributed to you and can be taken into account when you sell the property. This means the usage is attributed and there is no tax to pay at the time of the transfer if the main home exclusion applies. For information about when rollover relief applies, see Part 3 - Rollover relief. Renting to flatmates Generally, when you're renting out a room in your home to a flatmate, the main home exclusion may still apply and you will not be taxed under the bright-line test. For more information go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz and refer to Question we've been asked (QB) 24/02: Income tax – bright-line test – main home exclusion – renting to flatmates. BRIGHT-LINE PROPERTY TAX19 Co-owners Co-owners of property can have different main homes. On disposal, the bright-line test will only apply to an owner who has not used the property as their main home. For example, a person living in one city may have a different main home from their spouse or partner living in another city. The partner who co-owns the property and has not used it as their main home is required to pay income tax on their portion of any profit made when the property is sold, if sold within the bright-line period. Where property is held: •by joint tenant co-owners (that is, they do not have distinct shares in the property), profits/losses are allocated equally between owners •by tenants in common co-owners (that is, where each owner has a distinct share in the property), profits/losses are allocated according to each owner's share of the property. Construction period When you build a new home, you can ignore the construction period when determining if your usage of the property qualifies for the main home exclusion. Only look at your usage for the period before construction began, and from when construction was completed to when the property was sold. Construction is the work to build or erect the home, including the design phase. Construction is usually considered complete when the code compliance certificate is issued under the Building Act 2004. The exact length of the construction period depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. Example On 1 December 2023, Josh enters into an agreement to purchase a property off the plans in a new development. Construction is due to be completed in early 2025, but due to delays, construction is not completed until 2 June 2025. Josh moves into the property immediately following settlement on 3 June 2025 and uses it as his main home until he enters into an agreement to sell the property on 4 December 2025. Josh can ignore the 30-month construction period and only look at the period from 3 June 2025 to 4 December 2025 when determining whether he qualifies for the main home exclusion. He qualifies for the main home exclusion because he lives in the property as his main home for that whole period. Any profit on the sale is not taxable under the bright-line test. 20 ird.govt.nz Example 19 November 2024 Amelia enters into an agreement to purchase a bare section 18 December 2024 Title is transferred to Amelia 20 January 2025 Design of the new house begins 10 June 2025 Construction is completed 11 June 2025 Amelia moves into the property 4 July 2025 Amelia moves out of the property 15 September 2025 Amelia enters into an agreement to sell the property 8 October 2025 Transfer of title for the sale Bright-line period 272 days Vacant for 33 days Vacant for 73 daysLived in for 24 daysConstruction for 142 days On 19 November 2024, Amelia enters into an agreement to purchase a bare section. The title is transferred to Amelia on 18 December 2024. On 20 January 2025, Amelia engages an architect to start drawing up plans, starting the design of the new house. Construction is completed on 10 June 2025. Amelia moves into the house on 11 June 2025 and uses it as her main home until 4 July 2025. Amelia enters into an agreement to sell the property on 15 September 2025 and the title is transferred to the new owner on 8 October 2025. Summary of Amelia’s situation •The bright-line period is 272 days, from 18 December 2024 to 15 September 2025. •Total vacant days is 106 days. This is the period before construction begins from 18 December 2024 to 19 January 2025 (33 days) and when Amelia moves out of the property to the end of the bright-line period from 5 July 2025 to 15 September 2025 (73 days). •The construction period is 142 days from 20 January 2025 to 10 June 2025. •Amelia lives in the property for 24 days from 11 June 2025 to 4 July 2025. To work out if the main home exclusion applies, Amelia can ignore the 142 construction days in the bright-line period. 130 days (272 – 142) is the total days used to calculate the main home exclusion. Amelia uses the property as her main home for 24 days, so it is her main home for 18% of the time (24 / 130 days). The main home exclusion does not apply to Amelia because the property is used as her main home for less the 50% of the bright-line period. Amelia’s profit on the sale is taxable. BRIGHT-LINE PROPERTY TAX21 Subdivided property and the main home exclusion The main home exclusion can apply to subdivided land even if there is no house on the subdivided section, as long as the land has been used as your main home for more than 50% of the bright-line period. This means your use of the land before subdivision and your use after subdivision is considered. Example Ling buys a property and uses it as his main home. Due to a change of circumstances, Ling decides to subdivide it after 2 months and sell off the back part of the original section. 2 new titles are issued on the subdivision – 1 for the subdivided section with the house and 1 for the subdivided section at the rear of the property that was previously used as the backyard. Ling continues to enjoy the land in the section as his backyard until he eventually manages to sell that section 12 months later. The sale of the backyard section is within the bright-line period that would have applied for the undivided property. Ling can use the main home exclusion for the sale because the land in the backyard section is used as his main home for more than 50% of the bright-line period. Fact variation: Instead of using the rear section as his backyard, Ling constructs a new home (with a small garden and a garage) 2 months after buying the property. The main home exclusion does not apply to the sale of the section with the new home (the former backyard) because the land in that section is not used as his main home for more than 50% of the bright-line period. Ling's bright-line period is 14 months, but he only uses the land in the subdivided section for his main home for 2 months. For more information go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz and refer to Question we've been asked (QB) 18/16: Income tax – bright-line test – main home exclusion – sale of subdivided section. Business premises exclusion The bright-line test does not apply to residential property that has been used predominantly as business premises. The property does not need to be used as a business premises by the owner; it may be rented out by the owner to other persons to use as their business premises. Example Natalie purchases a 'live-work' warehouse/apartment on a single legal title. The property is a 100m 2 warehouse on the ground floor and a 60m 2 1-bedroom apartment on the first floor. Natalie leases the entire property to a tenant who operates a business from the ground floor. The tenant lives above the business in the 1-bedroom apartment. Natalie sells the property within the bright-line period to raise funds to start her own business. The 'work' component of the 'live- work' warehouse/apartment is bigger than the 'live' component of the property. The property is predominantly used as a business premises and is therefore not subject to the bright-line test. If the first floor was more than 100m 2 , the bright-line test would apply, as the property is 'residential land'. This is on the basis the property is 'predominantly used as a place of residence or abode'. 22 ird.govt.nz This exclusion does not apply when a residential property is: •rented out for residential purposes such as a residential rental property •used to provide short-stay accommodation - the business of supplying accommodation and the house is not the owner’s main home. For more information about the treatment of short-stay accommodation, go to Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 33, No 6 (July 2021) page 21. For more information about the business premises exclusion, go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz and refer to Question we've been asked (QB) 19/13: Income tax – When does the business premises exclusions to the bright-line test apply? Farmland exclusion The bright-line test does not apply to farmland. For the farmland exclusion to apply, the property must be: •worked in a farming or agricultural business by the owner of the property, or •capable of being worked as a farming or agricultural business because of its area and nature. Property worked in the farming or agricultural business must be worked by you, the owner; it cannot be rented to someone else who farms it. For a property to be capable of being worked as a farming or agricultural business, it must be suitable to support farming activities without major investment or modifications. Example Lee owns a 2 hectare lifestyle block including a house, vegetable garden and shed. Lee rents out the property to a family who graze 10 sheep and makes $2,000 a year selling the stock at the public livestock auction. The farmland exclusion does not apply because Lee is not carrying on a farming or agricultural business. The land is not suitable to be worked as a grazing business without significant investment or modification. Also, while income is derived from grazing, the amount of income is not sufficient to cover what it costs to hold and operate the land as a farming business. If Lee sells the property within the bright-line period, any profit made on the disposal will be taxable under the bright-line test. BRIGHTāLINE PROPERTY TAX23 Subdividing farmland If you subdivide farmland and sell a portion of it, the subdivided portion of the land (along with other land owned or leased by you in your business) needs to be worked, or capable of being worked, as a farming or agricultural business at the time of sale for the farmland exclusion to apply. Consider the area and the nature of the subdivided land in isolation from the rest of the land and whether the subdivided portion can support farming activities without major investment or modifications. The land must be suitable for a farming or agricultural business, without needing significant changes for the farmland exclusion to apply. When land is subdivided, the start date for the bright-line period is the original date of registration for the undivided property. Example Jean and Robin own 150 hectares of land and use it in a dairy farming business. After 2 years, Jean and Robin decide to subdivide 2 hectares of the land to build a family home on the new section. The subdivided portion is fenced off and is no longer being worked or capable of being worked by Jean and Robin along with other pieces of land in their dairy farming business. The 2 hectares is now considered residential land and if sold, Jean and Robin will have to consider if the bright-line test applies. For more information go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz and refer to Question we've been asked (QB) 18/17: Income tax – bright-line test – farmland and main home exclusions – sale of lifestyle blocks. 24 ird.govt.nz Part 3 - Rollover relief Rollover relief applies to certain types of ownership transfers and means: •the person transferring property to you will not be taxed at the time of the transfer •we treat you as having purchased the property at the same time and for the same price as the person you received it from. You take the previous owner's bright-line start date and cost base, and the previous owner is treated as having sold the property at cost. Rollover relief is available for property transferred: •as deceased estate and inherited property •under a relationship property agreement •under a resident’s restricted amalgamation •between associated persons •to a trustee of a trust if all beneficiaries are persons that have been associated with the transferor or charities. Rollover relief also applies to certain transfers of land subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 and transfers as part of settling Te Tiriti o Waitangi - Treaty of Waitangi claims. Note The rules for rollover relief for certain ownership transfers of residential property between 1 April 2022 and 30 June 2024 were different. For more information, see our guide Bright-line property tax – IR1227. Transfers of deceased estate and inherited property The bright-line test provides an exemption for transfers of an estate following the owner’s death. The transfers from the deceased person to the executor or administrator of the estate, and from the executor or administrator to the beneficiary, are treated as taking place at the total cost of the land to the deceased person (rather than at the land’s market value) at the date of transfer. The effect is no tax liabilities arise under the bright-line test for these transfers. The subsequent sale or disposal of the inherited property by the beneficiary is also not taxable under the bright-line test. BRIGHT-LINE PROPERTY TAX25 Example Ali bought a house as a private residence for himself in May 2022. According to Ali’s will, his son Omar will inherit the property. At the time of Ali’s death, the property is transferred to the executor under Ali’s will in April 2024. As part of distributing the assets, the executor transfers the property to Omar, the beneficiary in August 2024. The transfer of the property from Ali’s estate to the executor, and on to Omar (the beneficiary), is excluded from the bright-line test. This means there is no tax to pay. Any subsequent disposal by Omar is also exempt, so if he later sells the property, there will be no tax to pay under the bright-line test. Transfer of inherited property to a trust The transfer of inherited residential property from the beneficiary to a family trust may qualify for rollover relief. Example Omar transfers the property he inherited from his father, Ali, to the Omar family trust in May 2026. Omar is the principal settlor and a beneficiary of the trust at the time of transfer. Because the transfer is made after 1 July 2024, rollover relief applies to the transfer from Omar to the family trust, meaning the exemption from the bright-line test for inherited property is rolled over to the trustees of the family trust. If the trustees dispose of the property they will have the same tax treatment that Omar had on disposal, that is the disposal is exempt from the bright-line test and there is no tax to pay. Non-inherited portion If a beneficiary acquires part of a property other than by inheritance, that portion may be subject to the bright-line test when subsequently sold. This can happen if multiple people inherit a property and 1 of the beneficiaries decides to sell their share to 1 of the beneficiaries. Example Matt and Arun are each left a half-share in a residential rental property in Clive’s will. Matt sells his half-share to Arun at market value. Arun is registered on the title on 12 April 2024 becoming the sole owner of the property. He subsequently sells the property on 13 September 2025. The bright-line test applies to the half share purchased from Matt because the bright-line end date, 13 September 2025, is within 2 years of the bright-line start date, 12 April 2024. Arun will need to pay tax on any profit from the sale of the half share he purchased from Matt, unless rollover relief between associated persons applies. 26 ird.govt.nz Relationship property agreements Rollover relief applies to transfers of property under a relationship property agreement (between de facto partners, civil union partners, or spouses) under the Property (Relationships) Act 1976. This means there is no tax to pay under the bright-line test. However, any subsequent sale of the transferred property may be subject to the bright-line test. If you are the recipient of the property and later sell it within 2 years from the date the property was first owned in the former relationship, you will pay income tax on any profit you make unless you qualify for the main home exclusion. For more information about the main home exclusion, see Part 2 - Exclusions. Example After saving for 5 years, Emily and Ash purchase their first investment property and the property’s title is registered to them in May 2024. Twelve months later they separate. In May 2025 the property is transferred into Ash’s name as part of their relationship property agreement. In July 2025 Ash sells the property for more than the original purchase price. The transfer of Emily’s share to Ash in May 2025 has no tax liability. However, there is a tax liability when Ash sells the property, as the sale (July 2025) is within 2 years of the bright-line start date (May 2024 when the property was first owned in the former relationship). Example Alex purchases a rental property and is registered on the title as the owner on 1 September 2024. On 2 May 2025, the property is transferred to Karen under a relationship property agreement. This transfer is not subject to the bright-line test because it is made under a relationship property agreement. Karen enters into an agreement to sell the property on 1 April 2026. Since the transfer to Karen is part of a relationship property agreement, the bright-line start date is 1 September 2024 and not 2 May 2025 when it is transferred to her. The sale is taxable because the bright-line end date (1 April 2026) is within 2 years of the bright-line start date (1 September 2024). Income is calculated using the price Karen sells the property for on 1 April 2026 with a deduction for how much Alex pays for the property on 1 September 2024. Example Jay and her husband Ralph purchase a rental property on 9 September 2025. Jay and Ralph separate. As neither of them want to keep the property, they sell it to a third party on 17 March 2027. Since the property is not transferred to either of them under a relationship property agreement, but sold to a third party, rollover relief does not apply. Instead, the bright-line test applies and the transaction is taxable as the bright-line end date (17 March 2027) is within 2 years of the bright-line start date (9 September 2025). BRIGHT-LINE PROPERTY TAX27 Example David and his wife Susan purchase a rental property on 20 October 2022. David and Susan decided to separate. David and Susan agree that as part of the settlement, David will pay $100,000 to Susan. David has trouble raising the funds to pay Susan. They agree to sell the rental property so David can pay Susan the $100,000 from his share of the proceeds of the sale. David and Susan sell the property to a third party under an agreement dated 24 September 2024. Rollover relief for relationship property only applies to the transfer of property between spouses or civil union or de facto partners under a relationship property agreement. However in this case, the rental property is not transferred to one of them under a relationship property agreement but is sold to another party. Therefore rollover relief does not apply. The sale of the property is taxable under the bright-line test because the bright-line end date (24 September 2024) is within 2 years of the bright-line start date (20 October 2022). Transfers between associated persons From 1 July 2024, rollover relief applies to: •all transfers between persons that are associated, provided they have been associated for at least 2 years prior to the transfer date •a transfer to a trustee of a trust in which all beneficiaries are persons that have been associated with the transferor for at least 2 years prior to the transfer date (other than infants that are less than 2 years old and persons that are associated due to a recent marriage or adoption), or charities. Note Rollover relief can only be claimed for a property under the associated persons rules once in any 2-year period from the date of the first transfer. Transfers between associated persons include: •companies with 50% or more common ownership •a company and a person other than a company if the person has a 25% or more voting interest in the company •2 relatives within 2 degrees of blood relationship (see next page) •a person and a trustee of a trust if a relative of the person is a beneficiary of the trust •a trustee of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust •a trustee of a trust and a trustee of another trust if the same person is a settlor of both trusts •a trustee of a trust and a settlor of the trust •a settlor of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust •a trustee of a trust and a person who has a power of appointment or removal of the trustee •a partnership and a partner in the partnership •a look-through company and a person who has a look-through interest for the look-through company and who is a director or employee for the look-through company. 28 ird.govt.nz The bright-line test uses the non-land rules for associated persons. For further information, go to A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes – IR620. Associating 2 relatives The following flowchart shows 2 degrees of relationship for relatives. Your children and your spouse’s children and adopted children Their spouse(s) Your grandchildren and your spouse’s grandchildren Your grandparents and your spouse’s grandparents Your siblings and your spouse’s siblings Your parents and your spouse’s parents YouYour spouse A person is an associated family member if: •Blood relationship – the other person is their parent, grandparent, child, grandchild or sibling •Marriage – the other person is their spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner •In-laws – the other person is their spouse, civil union partner, de facto partners parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, or siblings •Adoption – a child by adoption is treated as the natural child of the adoptive parents. This does not apply if the person cannot be reasonably expected to know that the other person exists. BRIGHTāLINE PROPERTY TAX29 Example – Transfer from a parent to a child (relatives within 2 degrees of blood relationship) Kai owns a property with a bright-line start date of 7 July 2024. The cost of the property is $850,000. Kai rents out the property for 6 months then decides to transfer the property to her daughter, Talia on 10 January 2025. Talia moves in on 15 January 2025 just before starting a new job. Kai is associated to Taila under 2 degrees of blood relationship and the transfer of property qualifies for rollover relief. Kia is treated as transferring the property for its cost ($850,000) and no tax consequences arise for her under the bright-line test. Fact variation: If Kai transferred the property to her nephew or niece, rollover relief would not apply because they are not associated family members. Transfer of property from individual (trustee, settlor and beneficiary) to family trust Where a property is transferred from an individual who is associated to a trust, the trust is treated as having purchased the property on the earliest day that the property was transferred to the trust and at cost. The bright-line clock will not restart for the trust. Example Jocelyn owns a property with a bright-line start date of 4 June 2024. The property cost $750,000. In December 2024, Jocelyn is advised by her lawyer to transfer the property to her family trust, which she does. She has been a settlor, trustee and beneficiary of the family trust since it was established in 2020. As a settlor and beneficiary of the family trust, Jocelyn is associated with the family trust and has been associated with it for more than 2 years. The transfer of property to the family trust qualifies for rollover relief. Jocelyn is treated as having transferred the property to the family trust for its cost ($750,000) and no tax liability arises for her under the bright-line test. The family trust is treated as having purchased the property on 4 June 2024 for $750,000. Fact variation: Following the transfer from Jocelyn above, in June 2025 the trustees of the trust resolve to transfer the property to Jocelyn’s sister, who plans to renovate and sell it. Jocelyn’s sister has also been a beneficiary of the trust since it was established. As a beneficiary of the family trust, Jocelyn’s sister is associated with the family trust and has been associated with the trust for more than 2 years. However, because the property has been transferred in a transaction that was subject to rollover relief within the last 2 years, the associated person rollover relief cannot be used again. This transfer is subject to the bright-line test. 30 ird.govt.nz Transfers to or from look-through companies (LTCs) Rollover relief applies to transfers between LTCs and a person who has a look-through interest for the LTC and who is a director or employee for the LTC. Example Eddie purchases a property with a bright-line start date of 2 June 2024 for $1,000,000 and lives in the property for 18 months as his main home. Eddie decides to transfer the property to Baxter Limited on 2 December 2025 to rent out as part of its holiday accommodation business. Eddie has owned a 100% interest in Baxter Limited since 1 April 2022. Eddie transfers the property at the same price he paid for it ($1,000,000). Rollover relief applies because Eddie and Baxter Limited are associated at the date of the transfer and have been associated for at least 2 years prior to the transfer date. Fact variation: If Baxter Limited sells the property on 13 March 2026, the bright-line test will apply because the bright-line end date (13 March 2026) will be within 2 years of the bright-line start date (2 June 2024). However, the main home exclusion will apply because Eddie lived in the property for more than 50% of the bright-line period (18 months from 2 June 2024 until 13 March 2026). Attributing main home usage If rollover relief applies, any period of time a property is used as a main home by the original owner is also attributed to you and can be taken into account when you sell the property. This means the usage is attributed and there is no tax to pay at the time of the transfer if the main home exclusion applies. For information about the main home exclusion, see Part 2 - Exclusions. Example Hamish and Jess buy their first family home in July 2024 and settled the property on the HJ Family Trust. They lived in the property for 12 months and then transfer it to another trust, H & J Family Trust, which they are also settlors of. H & J Family Trust rents out the property and after 6 months the property is sold. The 12-month period that Hamish and Jess live in the property is attributed to H & J Family Trust. The main home exclusion applies because the property is lived in for more than 50% of the bright-line period (12 out of the 18 months). For more information on rollover relief go to Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 36, No 4 (May 2024) pages 18 to 20. BRIGHT-LINE PROPERTY TAX31 Certain transfers of residential land subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 to or from a trust Rollover relief applies to transfers of residential land subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 to a trust provided that: •the trust is either a Māori authority, or is eligible to elect to be a Māori authority, because it receives and manages on behalf of Māori claimants, assets that are transferred by the Crown as part of a settlement of a claim under Te Tiriti o Waitangi •all relevant transfers to the trust are made by people who are beneficiaries of the trust, and •all beneficiaries of the trust are either members of the same iwi or hapū, or descendants of the same tipuna (living or dead). If these requirements are satisfied, the receiving trustee’s bright-line start date for the land is the same as that of the person who transferred the property (and not the date of the transfer). The transfer is treated as a disposal and acquisition, at the date of transfer, for an amount that equals the greater of the cost of the residential land to the transferor (the original owner) or the consideration paid by the transferee (the recipient). Example – Transfer from trustee of Māori family to a trust eligible to be a Māori authority Rewi and several family members own interests in a large parcel of land in Pukemoremore, subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. All the family members are descendants of Rewi’s late great-great- grandfather. Several townhouses are built on the land, and all of these are rented out to tenants. Rewi and his relatives decide to sell their interests in the land to a family trust that is settled by Rewi for the benefit of all surviving descendants of the great-great grandfather. The new family trust is eligible to be a Māori authority and elects to do so. The transfer of property to the new family trust is equal to the amount paid by Rewi even though the market value is higher. Rollover relief applies to the transfer of property to the new family trust. In this case, Rewi is the settlor of both trusts, and the beneficiaries of the new family trust are all descendants of the same tipuna. This means the property transfer is not subject to the bright-line test. The trustee is treated as disposing of the land at cost. There are 4 categories of property transfer that may qualify for rollover relief. •Transfers by settlors of a Māori family trust to the trustees. •Transfers back to the settlors who first transferred the property to the Māori family trust. •Resettlement transactions, where the trustees of a Māori family trust resettle the property on a new, related trust. •Transfers to certain trusts if the land is part of the settlement of a claim under Te Tiriti o Waitangi. 32 ird.govt.nz Transfers to Māori family trust You can get rollover relief for transfers of residential land if the land is covered by Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993, and all the following apply: •the trustee of the trust is either a Māori authority, or is eligible to be a Māori authority •all relevant transfers to the trust are made by people who are both settlors and beneficiaries of the trust •all beneficiaries of the trust are members of the same iwi or hapū, or descendants of the same tipuna (living or dead). Transfers from Māori family trust back to settlors You can get rollover relief for a transfer of residential land back to the settlor (or settlors) who originally transferred the property to the trust if all the following apply: •the trustee of the trust is either a Māori authority, or is eligible to elect to be a Māori authority •in addition to being settlors, the recipients are also beneficiaries of the trust •all beneficiaries of the trust are either members of the same iwi or hapū or descendants of the same tipuna •the land is subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 •the recipients get proportionally the same amount of land they had originally transferred to the trustees. Example Before 2010 Aroha and several members of her extended whānau, who are all members of the same iwi, hold interests in a parcel of land in Kaitaia subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. On 15 August 2010, Aroha and members of her family sell their interests in the land to a trust that is settled by Aroha and her brother, Tane, for $5 million. At this time, Aroha, Tane and the rest of the whānau holding interests in the land are beneficiaries of the trust and still are. On 28 May 2025, the trustees of the trust sell the interests in the land back to the members of the whānau for $5 million, being the same amount the trustees had originally paid for the land. The market value of the land at this time is $10 million. In this case rollover relief applies. The whānau who purchase their interests back have a bright-line start date of 15 August 2010, being the date the land is originally transferred to the trustees of the trust at the cost of $5 million. The bright-line clock is not reset for Aroha, Tane and their whānau who repurchase their interests in May 2025. A future disposal by the interest holders will not be subject to the bright-line test because their bright-line start date is 15 August 2010. BRIGHT-LINE PROPERTY TAX33 Resettlements of Māori family trust Rollover relief is available for a transfer of residential land held by trustees of a trust (trust B) that is either a Māori authority, or is eligible to elect to be a Māori authority, resettled to another eligible trust (trust A). This applies if at the time of the land transfer from trust B to trust A, all the following apply: •the beneficiaries of trust B are the same as for trust A •all beneficiaries of each trust are either members of the same iwi or hapū or descendants of the same tipuna •the land is subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. If the above requirements are met, a person holding residential land as trustee of trust A, where land was transferred to them from trust B, has the same bright-line start date for the land that trust B had. Land transferred as part of a settlement under Te Tiriti o Waitangi If you are transferred residential land on or after 1 April 2022 as part of a settlement of a claim under Te Tiriti o Waitangi, you may qualify for rollover relief. Settlements of claims under Te Tiriti o Waitangi can be a multi-stage process. The Crown will generally transfer Tiriti settlement property to a single governance entity known as post-settlement governance entity (PSGE). This entity may act on behalf of several groups, for example, different hapū, or as a collective for a number of iwi groups. The PSGE will then transfer settlement assets to different members of the claimant group under the deed of settlement or settlement legislation. Rollover relief is provided when residential land is transferred if the land is: •subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993, •part of the settlement of a claim under Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and •transferred to a trustee of a trust that is a Māori authority, or is eligible to be a Māori authority, under section HF 2(3)(e)(i) (that is, on behalf of Māori claimants, the trustee receives and manages assets that are transferred by the Crown as part of the settlement of a claim under Te Tiriti o Waitangi). This provides rollover relief for the transfer of Treaty settlement residential land from the PSGE to a member of the claimant group, for example, hapū. If the above requirements are met, the recipient trustee has, for the purposes of the bright-line test, acquired the land for its market value at the time the Crown transferred the land. At the exact time of the Treaty settlement, it may not be possible to work out the market value of the land. In this case, a reasonable estimate shortly after settlement (for example, determined for insurance purposes) is acceptable. The Crown is treated as transferring the land at the greater of the cost of the land to them or the amount they received from the disposal. 34 ird.govt.nz Part 4 - Co-ownership Sometimes people pool resources to purchase land, becoming co-owners. When there is a change to the shares that co-owners have in residential property, or when a co-owner is added or removed, the disposal of the share that changes hands may come under the bright-line test. The start of the bright-line period should reset only for the ownership share that has changed hands. Joint tenancy to tenancy in common (and vice versa) Where you change from joint tenancy to tenancy in common with no change to the proportion of the shares held, the bright-line period start date does not reset when the title is transferred. This also applies if the change is from tenancy in common to joint tenancy. Example Tony and Michael buy a rental property in August 2024 and are registered on the title as joint tenants. Later, they decide if 1 of them dies, they want the share of the partner who dies to go to that partner’s children. In June 2025, the title is transferred to change their ownership of the property from a joint tenancy to a tenancy in common (50:50). For the bright-line test to apply, there must be a disposal of residential land by either Tony, Michael, or both. They are not treated as having disposed of land for the purposes of the bright-line test. Tony and Michael own the same land (the estate in fee simple) before and after the transfer. Before the transfer, they each have an interest in the entire property and an equal 50% separate share. After the transfer, they each still have an interest in the entire property, and they each now have a 50% share. The start date is not reset in June 2025 when the title is transferred to change the form of co-ownership of the property. If Tony and Michael dispose of the property in the future, the bright-line period starts in August 2024 when the property’s title was first registered to them. Acquiring and removing shares If you own part of a residential property and then acquire an additional share in the same property, you will have different bright-line start dates for those respective shares in the property. The bright-line period starts from the date each increase in share takes place. BRIGHT-LINE PROPERTY TAX35 Example Hina and Andy enter into a binding agreement to buy a rental property as tenants in common on 30 June 2023. Hina owns 50% and Andy owns 50%. Settlement is on 31 July 2023. Hina sells her shares to Andy on 31 August 2024 at market value. The title is transferred to Andy who now owns 100% of the property. For the purposes of the bright-line Hina has disposed of her 50% interest in the land. This disposal is income under the bright-line test because the bright-line end date (31 August 2024) is within 2 years of the bright-line start date (31 July 2023). Hina can deduct the amount she paid for her share of the property. If Andy then sells the rental property, the bright-line test will apply as follows: •50% share purchased on 31 July 2023, taxable if sold before 31 July 2025 •50% share purchased on 31 August 2024, taxable if sold before 31 August 2026. Example Alisha and Hans buy a rental property as tenants in common and are registered on the property’s title in July 2024. Alisha and Hans own a 50% share each. Alisha’s financial position changes in 2024. She asks Hans if he is interested in buying out part of her share of the property. He is keen to do this, so he buys half of Alisha’s 50% interest at market value. LINZ registers the transfer in December 2024 to show the land is now held 25% by Alisha, and 75% by Hans. This means for the purposes of the bright-line test, Alisha has disposed of a 25% interest in the land. Alisha’s 25% interest sold to Hans is income to Alisha under the bright-line test since the bright- line end date (December 2024) is within 2 years of the bright-line start date (July 2024). Alisha can deduct half the amount she paid for her original 50% share of the property, because she has sold 25% of her original share. The bright-line clock does not restart for Hans in December 2024 in relation to his original 50% share and nor does it restart for Alisha in relation to her 25% share she has retained. However, the bright- line clock does restart for the 25% share transferred by Alisha to Hans, with Hans having a December 2024 bright-line start date in relation to that 25% share. Subdividing co-owned land Co-owners may subdivide and allocate the land based on their original ownership interests. This is known as partitioning. In some circumstances the subdivision may be treated as a disposal of land at market value under the bright-line test or other land taxing rules. The bright-line test or other land taxing rules do not apply if the value of the partitioned land matches the interests you and your co-owners had in the undivided land. The value includes your contributions as co-owners to development and building costs. 36 ird.govt.nz If the land of a co-owner's partitioned interest after subdivision is more than their original co-ownership interest in the undivided land, the difference may be taxable. If the difference is 5% or more of the smallest co-owner’s original interest, the full difference is taxed under the bright-line test or other land taxing rules. If the difference in allocations is less than 5% of the smallest co-owner’s original interest, the difference is not taxable. A difference could happen because of the land topography (landscape). Example Maggie and Jordan are co-owners in a residential property purchased for $1 million. Maggie contributed $750,000 (holding 75% interest) and Jordan contributed $250,000 (holding 25% interest). They subdivide the land in 2 and allocate the parcels to themselves. Due to the landscape, Maggie’s land allocation changes to 74% and Jordan’s to 26%. Because the difference between Jordan’s original holding and the new allocation is less than 5% the transaction is not taxed under the bright-line test or other land taxing rules (5% of 25% is 1.25%).

BRIGHTāLINE PROPERTY TAX37 Part 5 - Deductions The cost of the property If you sell a property subject to the bright-line test, you can claim a deduction at the time of sale for the cost of the property. However, you cannot include anything you have already claimed a deduction for, for example if you were able to claim a deduction related to buying the property in the year you purchased it. The cost of the property includes: •the amount you paid to buy the property (the initial purchase price of the property) •expenditure related to the purchase, for example lawyers, valuers, surveyors and real estate agents fees •any capital improvements made to the property after buying it, for example renovations •expenditure related to the disposal, for example lawyers and real estate agent fees. You must keep records to support your claim for a deduction for the cost of the property. Examples include: •signed copy of the agreements for sale and purchase when the property was first purchased, and the on sale of the property. •settlement statements issued for both the purchase and the sale of the property. •evidence of other costs incurred on the purchase and on sale, for example invoices for lawyers, valuers, surveyors or real estate agents fees. •documents supporting any capital improvements to the property made after acquisition such as renovations, for example evidence of resource consent fees, architectural fees, engineers fees, invoices for labour and building materials. Holding costs During the period you own the property, you may incur periodic non-capital costs related to holding the property. These are holding costs and include things such as expenses for interest, insurance, rates and repairs and maintenance. Where holding costs are deductible, this must generally be done in the income year they are incurred. In the year of sale for rental properties, holding costs may have already been claimed in your income tax return against rental income. You must make sure you do not double claim these expenses. To deduct holding costs, the expenses must satisfy the deduction rules. Personal expenses are not deductible. For example, if the property is used for rental, and not for private purposes, the expenses are likely to be deductible. This is because there is a direct connection between holding costs and the rental income. When a property sale is taxable under the bright-line test and if that property has not been used to earn income during the year, then holding costs are not deductible because there is no connection between the costs and the taxable sale. 38 ird.govt.nz For there to be a connection to the holding costs, expenditure must be in relation to the sale of the property when it is certain to be taxable under the bright-line test. Generally, this will be when you sell the property and enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement. Any interest expenditure prior to the date of the agreement to sell the property is not deductible. Example – Property is vacant, then lived in for a short period of time Bright-line period 6 February 2024 Debbie and Mike enter into a contract to purchase a property 27 February 2024 Title is transferred to Debbie and Mike 1 August 2025 Debbie and Mike enter into a contract to sell the property 28 August 2025 Transfer of title for the sale Vacant28 days - holding costs can be claimed On 6 February 2024, Debbie and Mike enter into an agreement to purchase a property for $800,000 and the title is transferred on 27 February 2024. Debbie and Mike’s expenses per week are: •Interest payments on the mortgage $400. This is the interest only, not the capital repayments. •Rates $50. •Insurance $50. In September 2024, Debbie and Mike spend $20,000 adding a new deck to the property and in November 2024 repairs are made to the fence for $1,000. The property is vacant during the bright-line period. On 1 August 2025, they enter into an agreement to sell the property for $1,000,000. Title is transferred to the new owner on 28 August 2025. The property is taxable under the bright-line test because it is sold after 1 July 2024 and the bright- line end date (1 August 2025) is within 2 years of the bright-line start date (27 February 2024). The property is not used to earn income and there is no connection to the holding costs until 1 August 2025, which is the date they sign the agreement to sell the property. This means from the date they committed to sell until the date of settlement, the holding costs are deductible as there is a connection to the sale of the property. The following is used to calculate the income and expenses: •Sale price is $1,000,000 (the amount Debbie and Mike sold the property for). •Cost is $800,000. •Repairs and maintenance is $0. The $1,000 fence repair in November 2024 is before 1 August 2025 when the agreement is entered into to sell the property. BRIGHTāLINE PROPERTY TAX39 •Interest is $1,600. From 1 August 2025 to 28 August 2025 is 4 weeks in which the holding costs can be claimed ($400 x 4 = $1,600). •Rates and property insurance is $400. From 1 August 2025 to 28 August 2025 is 4 weeks in which the holding costs can be claimed ($100 x 4 = $400). •Capital improvements is $20,0000 (the spend on the new deck). For information on when repairs and maintenance can be deducted, go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz and refer to Interpretation Statement (IS) 12/03: Income Tax – Deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure – General principles. For more information on holding costs for land, refer to Interpretation Statement: (IS): 23/10: Deductibility of holding costs for land. Depreciation If you have claimed depreciation on any asset and sell the asset for more than its adjusted tax value, you'll have to include the difference between the sale price and the adjusted tax value in your taxable income. 40 ird.govt.nz Part 6 - Filing your income tax return Before you can file your income tax return, you need to complete a Bright-line residential property sale information – IR833 form for each residential property you have sold or disposed of that is taxable under the bright-line test. This can be completed during the income year or can be completed at the end of the income year and attached to your income tax return. The IR833 form can be found at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides 2 IR833 July 2024 Bright-line residential property sale information Follow the flowchart to check if you need to fill out this form. Refer to the notes on the following pages to help you complete the form. Tax year ending Your nameIRD number Bright-line test Is this property sale subject to the bright-line test? 1 Ye s No (You do not need to complete this form) Property title number 2 You'll find this information on the land title as the Identifier. For example, XA87A/809 Property address 3 Bright-line start date 4 The date to use depends on the type of purchase or acquisition. Refer to the notes for more information. Day Month Ye a r Bright-line end date 5 The date to use depends on the type of sale or disposal. Refer to the notes for more information. Day Month Ye a r Property sale income Sale price 6 Expenses Purchase price 7 Deductible expenses 8 Total costs Add Boxes 7 and 8. 9 Net profit (loss) Subtract Box 9 from Box 6 and print in Box 10. Use a negative sign if a loss. For example, -1234.56 10 Percentage of property ownership 11 % If the property is owned by more than 1 person, enter the percentage of the property owned by you or the entity. For example, if the property was purchased by you and your partner as an investment property, and you own half of it, the percentage will be 50%. If you do not share ownership of the property, copy the amount in Box 10 to Box 12. Your share of net profit (loss) Your share of net profit (loss) from your property sale. If you share ownership of the property, calculate this by multiplying the total net profit (loss) (Box 10) by the percentage of property ownership (Box 11). 12 If the figure in Box 12 is a net profit, include it in the Net bright-line profit box in the Income and expenses from residential property question in your income tax return. If you have a bright-line loss, do not include it in your income tax return and instead keep your own record of all bright- line losses you have made. Take a copy for your records and send this page with your income tax return. Alternatively you can complete this form in myIR as part of your income tax return. BRIGHT-LINE PROPERTY TAX41 Note If you are filing your income tax return using myIR, the net profit amount in the IR833 will not pre-populate into your income tax return. You must add this manually by ticking the ‘Income and expenses from residential property’ income type on the 'Build your return’ page and include your share of the net profit in the ‘Net bright-line profit’ box. Completing your income tax return Include your share of the net profit from the sale of a residential property taxable under the bright-line test in your income tax return. Usually, the date of settlement will determine the income year the income should be included. If you have a bright-line loss, do not include it in your income tax return and instead keep your own record of all your bright-line losses. The loss must be carried forward to a later income year where it can be used to offset income from other taxable land sales, including bright-line. Claiming a bright-line loss You can only claim the bright-line loss on the sale of a residential property you owned against profits made on other: •bright-line property sales, or •land sales taxable under the land taxing rules. You cannot offset a bright-line loss against your other income, such as salary and wages, rental, or business income. This also applies to bright-line losses for properties owned by a trust. Losses cannot be distributed to beneficiaries of the trust. Limiting bright-line losses claimed The loss amount you can claim in an income year is limited to the amount of bright-line and other land sale income you have in the same income year. Note Land sale income is the profit made from taxable land sales in an income year. If you cannot claim the full loss in the income year of sale, the balance is carried forward to future years where it may be claimed against other taxable land sales, including bright-line. For information about how to complete your income tax return, including how to record a loss, see above. 42 ird.govt.nz Carrying forward bright-line losses for a company A bright-line loss from the sale of a property owned by a company cannot be carried forward to a future year if the continuity test is not satisfied. For more information about the ownership continuity test, see taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz and refer to Interpretation Statement (IS) 22/07: Company losses – ownership continuity, sharing and measurement, page 13. Example In August 2024 Zac sells residential land taxable under the bright-line test. Zac acquired the land for $600,000 and sells it for $540,000. For the 2025 income year, Zac also earned an $80,000 salary. The $60,000 loss for the sale of residential land is ring-fenced and can only be used to offset income from other land sales. Zac cannot use the $60,000 loss to offset his salary income. In July 2025 Zac sells land he purchased with an intention to resell (so the sale is taxable). Zac makes a profit of $100,000 from this sale. Zac can offset the previous $60,000 bright-line loss against the $100,000 profit. As a result, Zac only pays tax on $40,000 of the profit in the 2026 income year. Note To address the risk of people using land-rich companies and trusts to circumvent the bright-line test, specific anti-avoidance rules apply. For more detail about these rules, see Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 28, No 1 (February 2016) page 89. Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) If you’re an offshore RLWT person you may have RLWT deducted from the sale or disposal of your residential property. You’re an offshore RLWT person when you’re an individual and any of the following apply: •You're a New Zealand citizen and you've been overseas for the last 3 or more years continuously (and you are not currently in New Zealand). •You have a permanent resident visa or a resident visa granted by Immigration New Zealand and have been overseas for the last 12 or more months continuously (and you are not currently in New Zealand). •You’re not a New Zealand citizen and you do not have a New Zealand residence class visa granted by Immigration New Zealand (you can be in or out of New Zealand). A non-individual incorporated or registered outside New Zealand or constituted under foreign law is also an offshore RLWT person. If you’re including a taxable property sale in your income tax return, then you’re entitled to claim the RLWT deducted as a tax credit, reducing your tax to pay. For more information about RLWT, go to ird.govt.nz/rlwt BRIGHTāLINE PROPERTY TAX43 Record keeping You need to keep all your records for at least 7 years. You do not need to send your records or working papers with your income tax return, but you must keep them in case we want to see them. You must keep records to be able to calculate your income and expenses. These include: •invoices and receipts •bank statements •working papers for all calculations •a list of assets including cost price and purchase date •a copy of any loan mortgage agreement. For more information about the records you must keep to support a claim for a deduction for the cost of the property, see Part 5 - Deductions.

[Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2013](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-amendment-act-2013 "Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2013")

Broadening the definition of 'income' for student loan repayment purposes
=========================================================================

2013 legislation broadens the definition of 'income' for student loan repayment purposes to include income from sources not previously included.

_Sections 4, 73, 74, 76, 79, 83, 114, 114A, 202, schedule 1 (clause 11) and schedule 3_

The new legislation makes changes to the definition of income for student loan repayment purposes to ensure that a borrower's repayment obligation accurately reflects their ability to repay their loan by including income from sources not currently included in the definition.

### Background

The student loan scheme is an income-contingent scheme, meaning that the amount that a New Zealand-based borrower has to repay in any year is dependent on their income.

The previous definition of "income" for student loan repayment purposes captured income taxed to the individual rather than to another entity. It included income such as salary and wages, New Zealand superannuation, interest, dividends, business income and rental income.

For borrowers who derive other types of income, the previous definition of income may not have reflected their actual earnings or financial resources which were available to meet their student loan repayment obligation.

Broadening the definition ensures that a borrower's repayment obligation accurately reflects their ability to repay.

The change to the definition of "income" for student loan repayment purposes follows changes signalled by the Government in 2010 relating to the way that income should be defined for the purposes of Working for Families Tax Credits and other social policy programmes.

Broadening the definition to better align with that used for Working for Families ensures there is greater consistency across all social policy initiatives to improve the integrity of the social assistance system. It follows initial changes made in April 2012 to excluded investment and business losses such as rental losses for student loan repayment purposes.

### Key features

The definition of "income" for student loan repayment purposes has been expanded to include further adjustments to ensure repayment obligations are determined on a fair and equitable basis for all borrowers who earn different types of income. The adjustments include types of income not previously captured so that the definition of income for student loan repayment purposes is broadly aligned with the definition of "family scheme income" under the Working for Families Tax Credit rules.

### Application date

The amendments apply from 1 April 2014, for the 2014-15 and later tax years.

### Detailed analysis

Section 73 simplifies the definition of "adjusted net income" to mean "net income" as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, with adjustments set out in new schedule 3.

The adjustments to "net income" in schedule 3 cover:

*   tax-exempt salary and wages, and certain overseas pensions that are exempt from New Zealand tax (clause 5)
*   PIE income that is not "locked in" (clause 6)
*   main income equalisation scheme refunds (clause 7)
*   income kept in a closely held company (clause 8)
*   distributions from superannuation schemes that relate to contributions made by a person's employer within the last two years, when the person has not retired (excluding KiwiSaver and locked-in superannuation schemes) (clause 9)
*   distributions from a retirement savings scheme when the person has retired early (clause 10)
*   income from a trust and companies owned by trusts when the borrower is the settlor (clause 11)
*   fringe benefits received by shareholder-employees who control the company (clause 12)
*   main income equalisation scheme deposits (clause 13)
*   50% of non-taxable private pensions and annuities (clause 14), and
*   payments from trusts, not being beneficiary income, when the borrower is not the settlor (clause 15).

The adjustments above, except those relating to clauses 8 and 15, are based on recent adjustments for Working for Families Tax Credit purposes. For more information refer to the _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011).

_Income kept in a closely held company (clause 8)_

Under the new rules, if a borrower is a major shareholder in a close company a portion of the company's net income for the year will be included as the borrower's income for student loan repayment purposes.

The purpose of this adjustment is to attribute income to the borrower from a company in which they exercise a degree of control, that is they can influence the extent to which the company distributes income to its shareholders. This extends the adjustment currently used for Working for Families Tax Credits to apply to determining income for student loan repayment purposes.

A close company is one in which there are five or fewer shareholders and a major shareholder in a closed company is a person who controls at least 10% of the company (refer to the definitions in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007).

The portion of the company's income attributed to the borrower is a function of how many shares the borrower owns and the company's net income calculated using the formula:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| (a / b) x c |     |
| where - |     |
| a   | is the number of shares issued by the company and held by the borrower, excluding fixed-rate shares, on the last day of the company's accounting year |
| b   | is the number of shares issued by the company, excluding fixed-rate shares, on the last day of the company's accounting year |
| c   | is the net income of the company for the company's accounting year. |

The company may have distributed dividends to the borrower in the same year. If so, these dividends are subtracted from the income attributed by the formula above. This avoids counting the income twice.

_Payments from trusts, not being beneficiary income, when the borrower is not the settlor (clause 15)_

Under the new rules, payments from trusts to a borrower are included as income for student loan repayment purposes in the income year in which the distribution is made where:

*   the distribution is not beneficiary income in relation to the borrower, and
*   the borrower is not the settlor of the trust.

The Commissioner has discretion to determine whether certain trust distributions should not be included as income for student loan purposes.
UNCLASSIFIED PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 19/01 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Milldale Infrastructure LP. Taxation Laws Legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GSTA). This Ruling applies in respect of: • Sections DA 1, DA 2, DB 6, DB 7, EW 3, EW 5, EW 14, EW 15, EW 29 and EW 31, and subpart RE of the ITA. • Sections 8 and 10 of the GSTA. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is a funding arrangement that includes: • the advancement of an amount by Milldale Infrastructure LP (the Applicant) to the Developer for the Bulk Infrastructure required for a proposed housing development in Milldale (the Developer Loan); • the satisfaction of the Developer’s obligation to repay part of the Developer Loan by registration of an encumbrance (the Final Encumbrance) over each subdivided section when title is issued; and • the payment by future landowners of amounts (Infrastructure Payments) over the term of the Final Encumbrance. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Background 1. The Developer (and its associated companies) are, or will be, the registered proprietors of land in Milldale, Wainui, Auckland, which will be subdivided to deliver approximately 3,860 new build houses, apartments and commercial premises. As part of the development of that land, the Developer is responsible for building bulk infrastructure (including storm water, drinking water, waste water and roading) (Bulk Infrastructure). The Bulk Infrastructure will be owned, operated and maintained by the local Council or other appropriate entity. 2. The Arrangement relates to a portion of the overall funding of the Bulk Infrastructure, and involves the recovery of amounts from the Developer and future landowners of the subdivided sections (the Landowners) as repayment of the funding. 2 UNCLASSIFIED 3. The relevant funding (the Developer Loan) was provided to the Developer by the Applicant on the terms and conditions set out in the Developer Project Agreement. The Developer is using the funding to assist the build of the Bulk Infrastructure required for the development. The Developer Loan is secured by way of a first ranking mortgage over all the land in the development (the Developer Mortgage). The Final Encumbrance 4. As titles are issued in respect of the subdivided sections the Developer will be treated as having repaid part of the Developer Loan by registering an encumbrance against the title of each subdivided section (the Final Encumbrance). The Background to the Final Encumbrance states: A. The Encumbrancee has helped fund bulk infrastructure projects (roading and wastewater) in the Wainui East area necessary to enable housing in the area to proceed including within the Milldale development. B. A portion of the overall bulk infrastructure project costs are to be recovered from the benefiting land owners as the repayment of, and return on, funding that related to the construction of the bulk infrastructure projects referred to above. C. As a condition of the Encumbrancee funding the bulk infrastructure projects described above the Encumbrancer or, from the time of sale, any subsequent purchaser of the Land is bound to pay the Infrastructure Payments to the Encumbrancee on the terms set out in this Encumbrance. 5. The Developer will sell the subdivided sections to third party purchasers (the Landowners). The titles will be transferred subject to the Final Encumbrance, such that the new Landowners will take on the obligation to make payments under the Final Encumbrance. No consideration will be paid for the transfer of the Final Encumbrance (clause 17 of the Final Encumbrance). 6. The Final Encumbrance requires the owner of each subdivided section (the Landowner) to make payments (Infrastructure Payments) to the Applicant over the term of the Final Encumbrance (30 years). Each Infrastructure Payment will fall due for payment in four equal quarterly instalments (clause 2 of the Final Encumbrance), on the same payment dates that apply for Auckland Council general rates. The payments under the Final Encumbrance will be made by Landowners to the Council as collection agent on behalf of the Applicant. 7. The full amount of Infrastructure Payments owing or that would become owing under a Final Encumbrance can be prepaid by a Landowner in a single lump sum payment (clause 7 of the Final Encumbrance). A Landowner is not entitled to make a partial prepayment of Infrastructure Payments (clause 8). 8. Once the final Infrastructure Payment has been made in relation to a specific section (and no arrears or enforcement costs are outstanding), the Applicant will remove the Final Encumbrance from the title. Future sales of the sections 9. Any future sale of the subdivided sections will also be subject to the Final Encumbrance until all of the required payments have been made and the Final Encumbrance has been removed from the title. Any subsequent purchaser is also 3 UNCLASSIFIED a Landowner for the purposes of this Ruling. No consideration will be paid for the transfer of the Final Encumbrance to any subsequent purchaser of the land (clause 17 of the Final Encumbrance). 10. Where an Infrastructure Payment has accrued for a period but is not yet due on the date that a section is sold, the Vendor may pay an amount as 'outgoings' to the purchaser on settlement for their share of the Infrastructure Payment. Similarly, if the Vendor has prepaid an amount of Infrastructure Payment for a period, the purchaser may pay an amount of 'outgoings' to the Vendor for their share of the Infrastructure Payment for the period. 11. The following example demonstrates the apportionment referred to above: Example A GST registered Landowner owns a section with a Final Encumbrance attached. Infrastructure Payments are $300 per quarter and are due for payment on the same payment dates that apply for quarterly payments of Auckland Council general rates, being: • 31 August, for the period 1 July - 30 September • 30 November, for the period 1 October - 31 December • 28 February, for the period 1 January - 31 March • 31 May, for the period 1 April - 30 June The Landowner sells the property for $500,000 plus GST, with settlement on 31 July. The Landowner has not paid the Infrastructure Payment for the period 1 July - 30 September. On settlement, there will be an apportionment of the accrued but unpaid Infrastructure Payment on settlement date, calculated on a number of days basis: 31 days / 92 days in the quarter \* $300 = $101.10 The 'outgoings' adjustment on settlement that the vendor will pay the purchaser for their apportioned share of the accrued but unpaid Infrastructure Payments will not be subject to GST. The settlement statement on 31 July will include: Purchase price as per Agreement for Sale and Purchase $500,000.00 Plus GST Less: credit for vendor's proportion of Infrastructure Payments from 1 July to 31 July (31 days) at $300 per quarter ($101.10) GST exempt GST (15% x $500,000.00) $75,000.00 Amount required to complete settlement as at 31 July $574,898.90 Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: a) This Ruling does not apply to: • The Developer; 4 UNCLASSIFIED • Any Landowner who holds the property for private purposes and to whom the private limitation in s DA 2(2) applies; • Any Landowner who holds the property for the purposes of deriving exempt income, and to whom the exempt income limitation in s DA 2(3) applies; or • A non-resident, unless the Landowner carries on business through a “fixed establishment” (as defined in s YA 1) in New Zealand and the property is used as part of carrying on that business. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: ITA a) The Final Encumbrance is a “financial arrangement” under s EW 3 and not an “excepted financial arrangement” under s EW 5. b) For the purposes of ss EW 15(1) and EW 31(7), the only amounts that are “consideration” under the Final Encumbrance are: • The Infrastructure Payments (including any lump sum prepayment of the amounts owing); and • Any amount paid to or by the Landowner as an adjustment of the purchase price for the accrued or prepaid portion of the Infrastructure Payment when a section is purchased or sold. c) Provided that the Landowner applies Determination S62 (which applies to allocate the consideration under the Final Encumbrance to an income year), the amounts allocated will be expenditure incurred by the person under s EW 14(3). d) Provided that the Landowner applies Determination S62, when the property is sold, or the final Infrastructure Payment is made, the Landowner will be required to calculate a base price adjustment (BPA) under s EW 29. The BPA calculation under s EW 31(5) must: • Add the aggregate of all Infrastructure Payments made over the period for which they held the property; • Add or subtract (as relevant) any adjustment made to the purchase price for the accrued or prepaid portion of the Infrastructure Payments when the property was purchased (the adjustments); • Add or subtract (as relevant) any adjustment made to the sale price for the accrued or prepaid portion of the Infrastructure Payments when the property was sold (the adjustments); • Subtract the aggregate of all Infrastructure Payments (plus or minus any adjustments) made over the period for which they held the property where a deduction was taken under subpart D. The BPA amount will equal the total Infrastructure Payments made in the BPA year (plus or minus any adjustments) and will be a negative amount. 5 UNCLASSIFIED e) Expenditure incurred by Landowners under the financial arrangements rules (including the amount determined under Determination S62 and calculated under the BPA) will be deductible under ss DA 1 and DB 6 or DB 7, provided that no provision in subparts DB to DZ applies to deny a deduction. None of the general limitations in s DA 2 apply in respect of the expenditure. f) Provided that the Applicant holds a valid RWT exemption certificate under s RE 27, any Infrastructure Payment made by a Landowner under the Final Encumbrance (including any lump sum prepayment of the amount owing) will not be subject to resident withholding tax under subpart RE. GSTA g) Where a section is sold by a GST registered vendor as part of their “taxable activity” (as defined in s 6), the “value of the supply” (under s 10) is equal to the amount paid for the land as set out in the sale and purchase agreement for the property. The value under s 10 does not include any non-cash consideration for the transfer of the Final Encumbrance. h) Infrastructure Payments made by a landowner under the Final Encumbrance (including any lump sum prepayment of the amount owing) will not be subject to GST under s 8. i) On the sale and purchase of property, where the Infrastructure Payment for the period is prepaid beyond the date of settlement of the transaction, the payment by the purchaser for their apportioned share of the prepaid Infrastructure Payments is not subject to GST under s 8. j) On the sale and purchase of property, where the Infrastructure Payment for the period is accrued but unpaid on the settlement date, the credit allowed by the vendor for their apportioned share of the accrued but unpaid Infrastructure Payments is not subject to GST under s 8. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 October 2018 and ending on 30 June 2056.

UNCLASSIFIED PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 19/02 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Electricity Ashburton Limited trading as EA Networks. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of s CD 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is: • the payment of Consumer Discounts under the Consumer Discount Policy by Electricity Ashburton Limited (EA Networks) to electricity supply retailers (Retailers) that contract with EA Networks to use its electricity distribution network to supply electricity to consumers (Users); and • the passing on of these Consumer Discounts by Retailers to all eligible Users. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the numbered paragraphs below. EA Networks’ structure and shareholding arrangements 1. EA Networks owns and operates an electricity distribution network (Distribution Network) in mid Canterbury. EA Networks contracts to provide line function services to Retailers that wish to use the Distribution Network to supply electricity to Users. 2. EA Networks operates as a stand-alone co-operative company (Electricity Ashburton Limited, trading as EA Networks). EA Networks has two types of shares: rebate shares and deferred shares (non-rebate shares). Over 30,000,000 shares are issued. 3. The deferred shares (totalling 28,750,000) are owned solely by the Ashburton District Council and have no rights to dividends, rebates or discount payments. 2 4. EA Networks’ website contains the following relevant information about the ownership and structure of EA Networks ( https://www.eanetworks.co.nz/about- us/ownership/ accessed 8 January 2019): Ownership and Structure EA Networks is the trading name of Electricity Ashburton Limited, a co-operative network business based in Mid Canterbury. The business incorporates an asset management function (the Network Division) and a contracting function (the Field Services Division). There are 30,069,100 shares issued in Electricity Ashburton Limited. The Ashburton District Council holds 28,750,000 of these shares in a non-rebate/non-voting form. The consumers/shareholders connected to the local electricity distribution system hold 1,278,200 rebate shares at 100 shares per consumer. All consumers/shareholders obtain a discount based on the line charges paid to the company. Consumers/Shareholders All new electricity consumers are initially a shareholder in the co-operative company. Almost every new consumer chooses to retain their shareholding and only a handful of existing consumers are not shareholders. Each shareholder (consumer) has one vote to elect a shareholder committee member, irrespective of the size/scale of their electrical connection(s). ... Rebate shares 5. Rebate shares are offered to anyone connected to EA Networks’ electricity lines network and who directly or indirectly pays for the use of the network (the User). Each User is entitled to hold 100 rebate shares, having a nominal value of $1.00 each. A User is entitled to hold only one parcel of rebate shares per connection. All rebate shares rank equally for voting. 6. The Constitution of EA Networks dated 2012 (Constitution) contains the following relevant definitions: “Holder”, “Shareholder” and “Member” means a holder of Rebate Shares or any other class of Equity Securities issued by the Company. “Minimum Holding” means a Minimum Holding of Rebate Shares to be held by a Shareholder to give an entitlement to Rebates such Minimum Holding being determined from time to time by the Board pursuant to clause 7.2. “Rebate” means a distribution by the Company by way of cash, assets or other consideration to a User. “Rebate Shares” means shares issued to a User which entitles that User (but not an Energy Trader) to a rebate in respect of Services. “Services” means the direct or indirect provision of the right to use lines and equipment associated with lines owned by the Company for the conveyance of electricity. “User” means a person who is connected to the electricity lines owned and operated within the District by the Company and who directly, or indirectly through an electricity supply business, pays the charges for the use of those lines by being: (a) an end-customer who is liable for the payment of electricity conveyed to that customer over those lines or for services in relation to those lines; or (b) an end-customer of any electricity supply business that is liable for payment for services in relation to those lines; AND EXCLUDES 3 (c) an Energy Trader; and (d) A person who is connected to such lines for a short or temporary period 7. The Constitution defines “rebate” to mean a distribution by EA Networks by way of cash, assets or other consideration to a “User”. A “User” is defined as a person who is connected to the electricity lines owned and operated by EA Networks and who directly, or indirectly through a Retailer, pays the charges for the use of those lines by being: (a) an end-customer who is liable for the payment of electricity conveyed to that customer over those lines or for services in relation to those lines; or (b) an end-customer of any Retailer that is liable for payment for services in relation to those lines. 8. Clause 7 of the Constitution refers to rebates and minimum holdings. Clause 7.1 of the Constitution restricts the Board to only be able to issue Rebates to “Holders of Rebate Shares”, being a subset of “Users”, as explained below. Clause 7.1 relevantly states: 7 REBATE AND MINIMUM HOLDINGS 7.1 The Board shall determine from time to time the Rebates payable (if any) to Holders of Rebate Shares. The Board may also establish differential Rebates so that different levels of rebate are paid in accordance with any one or more of the following criteria:- 7.1.1 According to various numbers of units of energy consumed; or 7.1.2 Based on different levels of usage of the network of the Company; or 7.1.3 Based on different tariff classifications and pricing structures; or 7.1.4 Different levels of Services provided; or 7.1.5 Different capacity ratings; or On such other basis as is determined from time to time by the Board. ... 9. Clause 5.1 of the Constitution refers to rebate shares and states: 5.1 Rebate Shares. The Board shall give to every User the right to apply for and hold such number of Rebate Shares as shall be a Minimum Holding PROVIDED THAT no Energy Trader shall be entitled to apply for or be issued any Rebate Shares. To give effect to such provision the Board may:- 5.1.1 Provide that the amount payable for the said Rebate Shares shall be either paid in cash or deducted from Rebates payable to that User; or 5.1.2 Permit that User to pay the amount payable in respect of those Rebate Shares over such period or period as the Board considers appropriate. No User shall be required to hold any more Rebate Shares than any other User. The Company shall not issue and/or shall not approve the transfer of Rebate Shares which would result in any User holding less than a Minimum Holding. The Council shall be entitled to hold a Minimum Holding notwithstanding it holds the Deferred Shares. 4 10. The “Disclosure Document for Public Offering of Rebate Shares in Electricity Ashburton Limited (trading as EA Networks)” (d ated 29 March 2017) (the Offer) sets out, in cl 4, the key terms of the offer: Issuer Electricity Ashburton Limited \[EAL\] Description of Rebate Shares being offered The Rebates Shares are only available to persons who become connected to a network owned by EAL or obtain services from EAL. 100 Rebate Shares is the number of shares issued to each shareholder. All of those shares rank equally for voting. Consideration/Price for Shares Each Rebate Share is offered for $1.00 each. 100 Rebate Shares must be applied for. No moneys are payable on application and the shares are paid up from moneys or payments which shareholders receive arising from the shares held in EAL. Until fully paid up there is a liability for the $100. Those distributions can be a dividend, rebate or discount declared by EAL. Opening Date The offer opens on 29 March 2017. There is no closing date for this offer as it remains open to all persons who become connected to the EAL network. Number of Shares Offered The total number of shares offered cannot be determined as this depends on the number of persons connecting to the network. All shareholders holding rebate shares are restricted to 100 Rebate Shares. The Ashburton District Council holds shares so the Rebate Shares represented approximately 5% of the total shares on issue. Each person (which includes individuals, companies and other legal entities) connected to the EAL network can apply for 100 Rebate Shares which are issued for $1.00 each. Distributions EAL makes distributions from time to time to shareholders. These may be paid in cash or in the form of a rebate or other payment for the benefit of shareholders. Surplus cashflow may also be credited to all persons connected to the network including shareholders. EAL determines the method by which it makes distributions of any type to shareholders and how it pays or credits that distribution. Surrender/Transfer of Shares Shares are not transferrable except with Board approval. This only occurs in limited circumstances. On a shareholder ceasing to enter into direct or indirect (through an energy retailer) transactions with EAL the Rebate Shares held are surrendered by EAL at the lesser of $1.00 per share or the amount paid up on those shares. Fees or charges payable There is no liability to pay further charges or make additional payments on the shares being offered. 11. Users are entitled to purchase rebate shares (based on the existence of their connection) should they choose to exercise this right. There is no obligation on a User to purchase rebate shares. A small proportion (less than 1%) of EA Networks’ Users are not shareholders as they have not exercised their right to purchase rebate shares. 5 12. Clause 10 of the Constitution refers to payment of dividends and rebates and relevantly states: 10 PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND REBATES 10.1 Power to Pay a Dividend and Rebate: The Board may pay a Rebate or Dividend to any shareholder or other persons entitled thereto. Rebates and Dividends shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution or the terms of issue of the Securities then on issue. Rebates shall be given as discounts to holders of Rebate Shares (on the same basis as set out in clause 7.1) and may be paid in such manner as the Directors shall determine. 10.2 Persons to whom Dividend/Rebate payable: A Dividend or Rebate shall be paid to the person or persons who are the registered holder or holders of the Shares in respect of which the Dividend or Rebate is authorised at the time of the authorisation of the Dividend and Rebate (or at the time when the Dividend and Rebate is authorised to be made). 10.3 Dividend and Rebates to joint holders: If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Shares, and such persons are entitled to receive distributions in respect of the Shares, any one of them may give effectual receipts for any Dividend and Rebate in respect of the Share. 10.4 Manner of payment: A Dividend and a Rebate payable in cash may be paid in any manner (whether by direct credit or otherwise) directed by the person entitled to it. A Rebate may also be satisfied by crediting the account with the Company of the User entitled to that Rebate. Payment may be made by cheque sent by post: 10.4.1 to the registered address of the Shareholder or person entitled thereto; or 10.4.2 In the case joint holders to any one of the joint holders at his or her registered address; or 10.4.3 To such persons and to such address as the Shareholder or person entitled or such joint holder as the case may be, may direct; And the Company shall not be responsible for any loss arising from such mode of transmission. 10.6 Deductions from distribution: The Directors may deduct from any Dividend and Rebate payable to any Shareholder entitled to receive Dividends or Rebates all such sums of money as may be due from him or her to the Company on account of any or all of the following: 10.6.1 Calls, instalments, any debt, or liability to the Company or any Related Company; and 10.6.2 Debts, liabilities or obligations in respect of which the Company has a lien over specific Shares in respect of which the distribution is made; and 10.6.3 Such amounts as the Company may be called upon to pay under any legislative enactment in respect of the Shares of a deceased or other Shareholder; 10.6.4 Any payment required to increase the Rebate Shares held by that Holder to a Minimum Holding. 13. Clause 10 of the Constitution provides that EA Networks may make payments of rebates (as defined in the Constitution) to a User. Pricing and payment of discounts 14. Each month EA Networks charges a distribution fee to the Retailers for using the Distribution Network. The Retailers then recover this fee from the Users through 6 separate contractual arrangements. A User is defined to mean a person who is connected to the electricity lines owned and operated by EA Networks and may include non-holders of rebate shares. 15. EA Networks’ document “Pricing Methodology Electricity Distribution Network” (effective from 1 April 2018), states (at p 29): Non-standard contracts EA Networks does not have any customer or group of customers on non-standard contracts. All end users are contracted (ultimately) to the network via our standard UoSA \[Use of System Agreement\] that we have with each Retailer operating on our network. 16. EA Networks has advised that, as a commercially-driven arrangement, EA Networks pays a differential consumer discount to all Users under its policy relating to the payment of discounts related to its electricity distribution business, based on certain eligibility criteria (Consumer Discount). 17. The “Statement of Corporate Intent 2018-19” for EA Networks states (on p 22) that, traditionally, EA Networks has made an annual deferred discount to all consumers (being the commercially-driven Consumer Discount as opposed to the term “Deferred Discount” as defined in the Constitution). The total amount of discounts EA Networks paid to Users in the past five financial years is shown in Table 1. Table 1: Discounts EA Networks paid to Users, 2014–2018 Year ended Amount excluding GST 31 March 2014 $4,198,280.97 31 March 2015 $4,497,785.34 31 March 2016 $3,473,247.30 31 March 2017 $2,782,033.11 31 March 2018 $2,858,083.39 Consumer Discount Policy 18. On 4 September 2018, EA Networks decided in principle to adopt the revised and updated version of its policy relating to the payment of discounts related to its electricity distribution business (the Consumer Discount Policy). A copy of the Consumer Discount Policy was provided to Inland Revenue as part of the ruling application on 15 November 2018. EA Networks will formally approve the Consumer Discount Policy before 1 April 2019. The Consumer Discount Policy will apply from the 1 April 2019 financial year. 19. The Consumer Discount Policy will not be amended during the period of the Ruling and will be adhered to for the period of the Ruling. 20. Under the Consumer Discount Policy, as part of the annual budgeting process, directors of EA Networks will decide the pool (if any) to be paid as a discount (Consumer Discount Pool) and the associated payment date. The directors’ 7 decision will be made before the start of the financial year to which the budget relates, which, for the avoidance of doubt, will be before 1 April each year. The payment date will be within the last quarter of the financial year to which the budget relates. 21. Under the Consumer Discount Policy, the principles that directors will consider when setting the size of the Consumer Discount Pool will include: • current and ongoing capital investment requirements; • operational requirements; and • borrowing/debt repayments, taking into account intergenerational fairness. 22. Under the Consumer Discount Policy, when setting the size of the Consumer Discount Pool, directors will decide on the allocation methodology to determine how much each User will be entitled to (Allocation Methodology). The Allocation Methodology will apply a fixed allocation formula and will be able to demonstrate a relationship between electricity distribution charges revenue received in the relevant budgeted year and the discount allocated to Users. 23. The Allocation Methodology will provide that a User's entitlement to be paid a discount from the Consumer Discount Pool will be in relation to their actual network usage or share of distribution charges paid during the measurement period stipulated in the Allocation Methodology. The entire amount of the Consumer Discount Pool will be allocated back to Users each year. 24. EA Networks will publicly announce the Consumer Discount Pool and the Allocation Methodology in advance of the commencement of the financial year to which it relates, by publishing all relevant information on its corporate website before 1 April each year. 25. The following is a draft of the announcement of the Consumer Discount Pool that will be published on EA Networks’ website for the financial year ended 31 March 2020 (supplied to Inland Revenue on 18 January 2019): EA networks annual consumer discount pool has been set at $XXX. It is EA networks intention to pay and allocate the consumer discount pool in accordance with the “Consumer Discount Methodology for the financial year ended 31 March 2020”. The methodology is available on EA network website www.eanetworks.co.nz. 26. The following is a draft of the Allocation Methodology for the financial year ended 31 March 2020 (supplied to Inland Revenue on 19 February 2019): EA Networks Consumer Discount Methodology For the financial year ended 31 March 2020 Introduction EA networks (the trading name of Electricity Ashburton Limited) is a consumer cooperative which has a policy of allocating a consumer discount to consumers connected to its network. This document describes the methodology used to make that allocation. To qualify for the consumer discount, consumers must be connected to the network at 5.00 pm on the last working day of February 2020. The first $100 of consumer discount ever paid to a consumer who is a shareholder of EA Networks will be used to purchase shares in EA Networks after which the consumer discount 8 generally appears as a credit on consumers’ April or May monthly accounts from their electricity retailer(s). For any questions on the consumer discount please contact EA networks (03) 3079800 or email inquiry@eanetworks.co.nz The consumer discount will be paid in accordance with the requirements of the Inland Revenue Department Building Ruling XXXX. For completeness we note that the consumer discount calculated and paid under this methodology is separate to any form of payment provided for in EA Networks’ constitution. Payments made under this methodology are not made in relation to any shareholding relationship and are made only due to the relationship between EA Networks’ and its’ end electricity consumers. Paid to all consumers The consumer discount will be paid to all qualifying consumers regardless if the\[y\] own or do not own shares in the company. Allocation of consumer discount to consumers Each consumer’s share of the consumer discount pool is calculated: A/B \*C . Where: A: EA networks charges to qualifying consumer for the measurement period. B: The sum of all qualifying consumer charges for the measurement period. C: The value of the consumer discount pool, set at XXX for XXXX. The measurement period runs from 1 March 2019 to 29 February 2020. 27. The announcement of the Consumer Discount Pool and the Allocation Methodology will be made before EA Networks issues invoices to Retailers for any distribution charges in respect of the financial year to which the Consumer Discount relates. 28. The Consumer Discount Pool and Allocation Methodology will also be notified in the Statement of Corporate Intent and the Distribution Pricing for the financial year to which it relates. 29. The value of the Consumer Discount Pool announced by EA Networks will not be altered during the applicable income year. 30. To be eligible to receive payment of the Consumer Discount under the Consumer Discount Policy a User must remain a User (as defined in the Constitution) connected to the Distribution Network at 5 pm on the last working day of February of the financial year to which the discount relates. The amount of the discount paid to an eligible User under the Consumer Discount Policy will be based on the User’s network usage or share of distribution charges paid within that financial year for electricity supplied to them through EA Networks’ Distribution Network in accordance with the Allocation Methodology. 31. Historically, EA Networks has paid out Consumer Discounts to all eligible Users connected to its network (whether they are rebate shareholders or not). Under the Consumer Discount Policy there is no requirement that Users are holders of 9 rebate shares in order to receive the discount. For the avoidance of doubt, under the Consumer Discount Policy, EA Networks will pay discounts to all eligible Users whether they are holders of rebate shares or not, and Retailers will pass on these discounts to all eligible Users whether they are holders of rebate shares or not. 32. The Consumer Discount that is paid under the Consumer Discount Policy is a discount provided to Users based on their electricity consumption. The discount is a commercial discount based on transactions with Users (regardless of their shareholding status) and is entirely separate from any deferred discounts and rebates to shareholders as provided for in the Constitution. For the avoidance of doubt, this Ruling does not consider or rule on the application of the taxation laws to any payments by EA Networks of any deferred discounts, rebates or dividends other than the Consumer Discount paid under the Consumer Discount Policy. 33. At the end of each financial year, EA Networks will contract with Retailers to receive payment of, and pass on to the eligible Users as instructed, the discount calculated in accordance with the Allocation Methodology that EA Networks announced at the beginning of the related income year under the Consumer Discount Policy. 34. The Allocation Methodology provides that the first $100 of the Consumer Discount ever paid to a User who is a shareholder of EA Networks will be used to purchase rebate shares in EA Networks (as provided for in the Offer) after which the discount will generally appear as a credit on Users’ April or May monthly accounts from their Retailer. For practical administrative purposes, EA Networks calls for the share cost at the same time it makes payment of the discount amount owing to the User under the Consumer Discount Policy to reduce the volume of transactions occurring. To keep the transaction volume at a minimum, EA Networks calls for payment of shares only to the extent that the User has a discount owing to them, to a maximum of $100 (that is, the shares’ total value). The User’s lines usage has to have been high enough to produce a discount in excess of the $100 and, if not, EA Networks will only call annually for payment that matches the discount, until the full $100 has been called. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The Consumer Discount Pool and the Allocation Methodology are communicated publicly on EA Networks’ website before 1 April of the financial year in which the Consumer Discount will be given. b) The Consumer Discount is allocated to Users based on a pre-determined Allocation Methodology based on their usage or share of distribution charges in the financial year in which the discount will be given. 10 How the Taxation Law applies to the Applicant and the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Law applies to the Applicant and the Arrangement as follows: a) A Consumer Discount paid under the Consumer Discount Policy by EA Networks to a User will not amount to a taxable dividend in the hands of the User under s CD 1. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 April 2019 and ending on 31 March 2024. This Ruling is signed by me on the 26 th day of March 2019. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)

The Product is capable of affecting the way in which interest is calculated on loans offered by Kiwibank which had an agreed fixed periodic repayment arrangement (also referred to as the “table portion” of a loan). Kiwibank also offers loans with a revolving credit feature whereby amounts can be repaid or re-borrowed at any time provided the principal, interest, fees and costs on the loans do not exceed the specified maximum credit limit (also referred to as the “revolving portion” of a loan). The Product does not apply to “revolving portion” loans. 3. In overall commercial terms, the economic consequences for a customer of using the Product, or using a revolving portion loan product bearing a variable interest rate, are broadly the same. 4. Prior to the introduction of the Product, customers of Kiwibank could elect for their table portion loan to have one or more of three components: fixed, variable, and construction components. 5. The “fixed component” of the loan is subject to a fixed interest rate for a fixed term. Customers may repay all or part of a fixed component at any time, although in certain circumstances they may be charged with a fixed rate break cost for making any repayment that exceeds an early repayment limit agreed with Kiwibank. 6. The “variable component” of the loan is subject to a variable interest rate. Customers may repay all or part of a variable component of a loan at any time without any break costs. 7. The “construction component” of the home loan is available where the home loan is obtained for the purpose of buying land and building a house on it or renovating a house on land the borrower already owns. The construction component of the home loan is subject to a variable interest rate and can be borrowed in stages (as opposed to a fixed or variable component which must be borrowed in a lump sum). 8. Kiwibank recognises that customers may have a range of accounts, including various deposit and loan accounts. Therefore, Kiwibank introduced the Product, which included a new component called the “offset variable component”. 9. When a customer elects that all or part of a loan is to have an offset variable component, interest accruing on that loan, or that portion of the loan, is to be calculated by reference to a notional balance. The notional balance is calculated by offsetting the debit balance of the offset variable component of the loan against the total credit balances of nominated everyday banking and savings and investments accounts (referred to as the “credit accounts”). This lowers the interest payable and the variable component of the loan. Therefore, it results in a greater proportion of a customer’s regular loan repayments being applied in reduction of the principal of the offset variable component of the loan. 10. This new feature effectively treats a group of accounts in a collective or aggregated manner for the purposes of calculating interest accrued on the offset variable component of the loan. This feature is intended to make the Kiwibank overall banking relationship more attractive to current and potential customers. 3 UNCLASSIFIED Interest calculations Calculations of interest on an offset variable component of a loan 11. Interest payable on an offset variable component of the nominated loan is calculated by reference to a notional balance. This notional balance is determined, for the purposes of that calculation only, by reducing the balance of the offset variable component of the loan by the aggregate of the credit balances of the nominated credit accounts. 12. The rate of interest applicable to the Product is the “offset variable interest rate”. The offset variable interest rate is one of a number of different rates which Kiwibank uses, under the Terms and Conditions of the various loans to which the Product applies. The offset variable interest rate may be above or below Kiwibank’s variable interest rate. 13. Interest is not calculated separately in respect of each account and then offset. Instead, a net notional balance is calculated across all the relevant accounts. The notional balance equals the offset variable component of the loan less (ie, “offset” against) the credit balances of the nominated credit accounts. Interest is then payable on that net balance at the offset variable interest rate. This is the case as a matter of law (in terms of the terms of contractual relationship under the various Terms and Conditions applicable to eligible loans offered by Kiwibank) and as a matter of practice (in terms of Kiwibank’s computer and accounting systems). 14. The offsetting is solely for the purpose of calculating the notional balance on which interest is calculated. There is no actual transfer of funds, no set-off or “netting” of funds together in an account, and no transfer of any interest in or entitlement to funds. Importantly, the customer has no legal entitlement to interest on credit balances. This is the case even if the customer’s total credit balances exceed the customer’s loan balance. 15. Interest is calculated on a daily basis and is debited to the loan account on a regular basis. Loan repayments are credited periodically into the loan accounts, which will pay the periodic interest and reduce the principal outstanding. Such payments are made from a Kiwibank account that the customer has selected. This account may or may not be another credit account that the customer has nominated to participate in the Product. 16. The offsetting aspect of the Product essentially offers the same economic benefits to customers as a revolving portion loan in terms of reduced interest costs (through a reduced balance on which interest is calculated) and consequently will accelerate loan repayments. With a revolving portion loan, funds that would otherwise be in a savings or cheque account are paid into the loan account (but are available to be redrawn). 17. Under the updated terms and conditions of the Product, Kiwibank intends to make the Product available to business customers for the first time. However, business customers will not have the ability to group their accounts with accounts of another entity, as individuals can. 4 UNCLASSIFIED No interest is payable on credit accounts 18. Under the terms and conditions agreed between Kiwibank and its customers for this Product, no interest is payable by Kiwibank on the credit balances of the credit accounts that customers have nominated to participate in the Product. This is regardless of whether those credit balances exceed the debit balance of the loan facility. This means that if the debit balance of a loan facility is less than the aggregate of the credit balances of the nominated credit accounts, no interest is paid or payable by Kiwibank. Eligibility requirements 19. The product is only available to: • An individual who holds an eligible loan with Kiwibank; • Two individuals who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship and who hold an eligible loan with Kiwibank; • A company which holds an eligible loan with Kiwibank (under the proposed changes to the product); and • A trust which holds an eligible loan with Kiwibank (under the proposed changes to the product). 20. "Eligible loans" will be the following loan products currently offered by Kiwibank: • Business loans secured by residential property; and • Home loans. 21. The following additional persons can elect to “offset” their Kiwibank credit account against the loan of an individual customer or two individual customers who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship: (a) a child or children of the customer (or one of the customers); or (b) a parent or parents of the customer (or one of the customers). 22. Children and parents of individual customers can have a registered address with Kiwibank that is different from that of the customer's. 23. An offset variable component of a loan can be “offset” against nominated accounts of the customer(s) or other eligible persons (in the case of individual customers). Other features of an offset variable component 24. The offset variable component is not an independent product; it is a component of a loan. The following features (amongst others) apply to the offset variable component along with the other components of a table portion loan: • Interest is calculated on a daily basis, and is debited to the loan account on each specific payment date. • Customers may repay all or part of an offset variable component of a loan at any time without any break costs, other than a flat administration fee. 5 UNCLASSIFIED • The interest and principal of an offset variable component are repayable by way of regular payment cycles over the term of the offset variable component, except in relation to any applicable interest-only period. Only interest payments are required to be made during an interest only period. “Repayment holidays” are also available, where no interest or principal is payable during a specific period. • All amounts owing under the table portion (including any offset variable component and other components) must be repaid in full on the last day of the loan term. • The offset variable interest rate can vary at any time. Kiwibank will give the customer notice before changing the rate: − If the offset variable interest rate increases, the customer’s regular payments for the offset variable component will automatically increase if this is necessary to enable the customer to pay off the offset variable component over the agreed term. − If the offset variable interest rate decreases, the customer’s regular payments for the offset variable component will remain the same, so the term of the loan will shorten. However, the customer can elect to reduce the amount of the regular payment so that the offset variable component can be repaid over the same term. • The Product is offered to customers having an existing variable rate table portion loan facility. If an existing customer elects to convert a part or all of an existing variable rate table portion loan to have an offset variable component, the customer must agree that Kiwibank’s applicable terms and conditions for the Product will apply. All new customers will sign new terms and conditions applicable to all Kiwibank accounts, which will, by definition, include the terms and conditions applicable to the Product. • A customer may have more than one loan account to which the terms and conditions of the Product apply, but each such loan account is treated separately. In the case of individual customers only, they may group their loan and credit accounts with the credit accounts of certain other individuals. • A transaction or deposit account (eg, everyday banking, savings and investments accounts) may be nominated to link to one or more loan accounts under the Product terms and conditions. If the outstanding balance of the various loan accounts exceeds the balance of the deposit account, the order of offsetting is determined by the “priority” ranking of each loan, as designated by the customer. • Interest cannot be capitalised on any loan to which the Product applies, except to the extent of any interest component on a defaulted payment which may be “capitalised” only for the purpose of calculating further interest and default interest owing on the loan. The defaulted interest does not become part of the outstanding principal loan balance and will remain an outstanding interest payment. Terms and conditions for the Product 25. Each Kiwibank loan is documented under a collection of documents: 6 UNCLASSIFIED a) In respect of home loans: i) The Home Loan Terms and Conditions, which are contained in a booklet that Kiwibank issues (as amended and updated from time to time) and which set out the generic provisions applicable to all Kiwibank home loan facilities. ii) The Home Loan Agreement, which contains specific provisions about the home loan facility that is being made available to a specific customer, including the amount and timing of regular payments calculated on a basis that will repay the loan over the applicable term. b) In respect of other loans: i) The Lending Terms and Conditions for Business and Rural Banking – effective December 2012, which set out the generic provisions applicable to all of Kiwibank’s business lending facilities. (ii) The Loan Agreement, which contains particular and specific provisions in relation to the business loan facility that is being made available to a specific customer including the amount and timing of regular payments, calculated on a basis which will repay the loan over the applicable term. c) In respect of all loans: i) The General Terms and Conditions, that contains the terms that govern the general banking relationship between Kiwibank and its customers. The General Terms and Conditions may also contain specific terms and conditions that apply to particular accounts and services. • In the event that there is any conflict between any part of the General Terms and Conditions and the Home Loan Terms and Conditions, the Home Loan Terms and Conditions will apply. • In the event that there is any conflict between any part of the General Terms and Conditions and the Lending Terms and Conditions for Business and Rural Banking, the Lending Terms and Conditions for Business and Rural Banking apply. Groups of accounts 26. The product is based on a group of participating accounts. The following rules explain which accounts can be included in the group: (a) The accounts of an individual, or the individual and joint accounts of married, de facto and civil union couples, any of their children, and any of their parents may be combined as part of one group. To illustrate, Sarah and Peter have a home loan facility with Kiwibank. If Sarah and Peter and their child, Michael, each have a savings account with Kiwibank, the home loan facility could be offset by the credit balances of the various accounts held by them. 7 UNCLASSIFIED (b) Borrowers of the home loan facility and owner of other transaction accounts nominated for the “offset” feature must be either: (i) all residents of New Zealand for tax purposes; or (ii) all non-residents of New Zealand for tax purposes. (c) Companies, trusts and sole traders are eligible to participate in the product Companies, trusts, and sole traders may group their transaction and eligible loan accounts for the purposes of the product. However, a company, trust, or sole trader may not group their accounts with the accounts of any other individual or entity. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) All interest rates related to the Product are arm’s length market interest rates. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) No consideration is paid, or payable, by virtue of the offset feature of the Product for the purposes of calculating income and expenditure under ss EW 15 or EW 31. b) No income arises under s CC 7 for Kiwibank’s customers in relation to the Arrangement. c) For the purposes of the “resident withholding tax rules” (as defined in s RE 1(1)) and the “non-resident withholding tax rules” (as defined in s RF 1(1)), there is no payment of, or entitlement to, interest in relation to the credit accounts participating under the Arrangement, that would give rise to an obligation to deduct resident withholding tax or non-resident withholding tax or pay an approved issuer levy. d) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 June 2016 and ending on 31 May 2021. This Ruling is signed by me on the 6 th day of March 2017. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)
1 UNCLASSIFIED PRODUCT RULING — BR PRD 18/06 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the person who applied for the Ruling This ruling has been applied for by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (New Zealand) Limited (the Bank). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: • ss BG 1, CC 7, EW 15, EW 31, GA 1, RE 1–6, RE 10, RF 1–4; and • ss 86F and 86I of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 (SCDA). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is a mortgage offset banking product (the Product) that the Bank offers to those customers (individuals) who take out a home loan. For the purposes of this product ruling, the term “Specified Account” as defined in the Home Loan and Personal Loan General Terms and Conditions documentation means “Specified Deposit Account”. The Product involves “offsetting” (for interest calculation purposes) a home loan account balance (the "offset portion") against a credit balance in a Specified Deposit Account. This reduces the interest payable by a customer on their home loan balance. The Arrangement is set out in the documents listed below, copies of which were received by the Taxpayer Rulings Unit, Inland Revenue, on 20 August 2018: • General Terms and Conditions; • Home Loan Application Form; • Home Loan and Personal Loan Letter of Offer; • Home Loan and Personal Loan General Terms and Conditions; • Home Loan and Personal Loan Agreement; • Home Loan and Personal Loan Component Tables; and • Retail Banking Fees and Charges Brochure. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in paragraphs 1 to 17 below. 2 UNCLASSIFIED 1. Customers may have a range of accounts with the Bank, including transaction accounts, savings accounts, and loan accounts. Loan accounts may be table only, reducing, principal and interest, interest only, fixed or variable home loan accounts. Primary feature of the Product 2. The primary feature of the Product is the offsetting feature. 3. To participate in the Product, a customer must have a home loan with an offset portion. Customers may convert an existing non-offset home loan to an offset home loan account. 4. Where a customer has a loan account with an offset portion, the customer must also have a Specified Deposit Account so interest can be calculated on the offset portion of a customer’s loan. 5. The Product applies an “offset” to an offset portion of a home loan against a Specified Deposit Account, with “offset” being one category of loan applicable to home loans. How the offsetting works 6. The “offsetting” is only to calculate the interest payable on the offset portion of the home loan. 7. Interest on the offset portion of the home loan is calculated, and paid by the customer, on the difference between the offset portion of the home loan balance and the credit balance of the customer’s Specified Deposit Account. Under the terms and conditions agreed between the Bank and its customers for the Product, the Bank pays no interest on the credit balance that is “offset” against the offset portion of the home loan. 8. Where the credit balance of the customer’s Specified Deposit Account exceeds the balance of the offset portion of the home loan it is “offset” against, the balance of the excess credit balance on which interest is receivable will be subject to the RWT rules, NRWT rules or the AIL rules. 9. The interest payable on the home loan account is calculated by reference to the balance of the offset portion of the home loan less the credit balance of the Specified Deposit Account. This will be the case as a matter of law (in terms of the Product’s documentation) and as a matter of practice (in terms of the Bank’s computer system). There is no actual set-off, netting, or transfer of funds, or transfer of any interest in or entitlement to funds. “Offsetting” occurs before debit or credit interest is calculated. 10. There is no provision for any interest saved under “offsetting” to reduce the “minimum payment”. The effect of “offsetting” is the same as a decrease in the floating interest rate and a decision not to reduce the amount of the “minimum payment”. The term of the loan is reduced because the principal portion of the payment is effectively increased. 3 UNCLASSIFIED 11. If the credit balance of the Specified Deposit Account is greater than the debit balance of the offset portion of the home loan, credit interest will be applied to the difference and paid to the credit balance account. 12. Interest is calculated by the Bank on a daily basis. If, during a month, the Bank is both entitled to receive interest (that is, the balance of the offset portion of the home loan exceeds the balance of the Specified Deposit Account) and, at another point in the month, is obliged to pay interest (that is, the balance of the Specified Deposit Account exceeds the balance of the offset portion of the home loan), then the two interest payments are made and are not set-off. 13. The “offsetting” feature of the Product essentially offers the same benefits to customers as a revolving credit loan in terms of lower interest costs and a shorter time to repay the loan. However, this feature overcomes a perceived disadvantage of a revolving credit loan because it allows customers to retain separate account balances (which customers may prefer when managing their finances). Terms and conditions for the Bank’s home loan products 14. Each of the Bank’s home loans is explained in a collection of documents. These include: a) a Home Loan and Personal Loan General Terms and Conditions (a standard form “master” document, which contains primarily generic provisions that apply to all of the Bank’s personal and home loan facilities); b) a Letter of Offer, which conditionally approves the Bank’s lending arrangements outlining the type of loan and loan amount, as well as any loan-to-value ratio applicable to the loan; and c) a Loan Agreement, which contains details of the parties to the loan, the amounts borrowed and terms and conditions applicable to the loan drawn down by the customer. 15. Table loans provide for regular payments and a set date when they will be paid off. Most payments early in the loan term comprise interest, while most of the later payments comprise principal repayments. Reducing loans have two separate repayments, one of interest and one of principal. Customers repay the same amount of principal each time and interest is charged separately. The Product can be used for both table and reducing home loans, to the extent the loan is subject to a variable offset interest rate. 16. Where an amount of a home loan is subject to offsetting, there are two separate repayments: one of interest and one of principal. Customers repay an amount of principal each time and interest is charged separately. If there is an increase in the variable offset interest rate during the term of the loan, the payment amounts increase so the loan is paid off over the same term as originally agreed between the Bank and the customer. If there is a decrease in the variable offset interest rate during the term of the loan, the payment amounts remain the same and 4 UNCLASSIFIED the term of the offset portion of the home loan is reduced (however, a customer has the option to reduce the payment amounts instead if the variable offset interest rates reduce over the term of the loan). The Bank’s objectives 17. The Bank’s objectives in providing the Product are to: a) increase its market share, particularly for home loans and transaction-type accounts; b) increase customer satisfaction and customer retention; and c) improve its brand awareness and be seen as a market leader. Condition\[s\] stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: a) All interest rates related to the Product are arm’s length market interest rates. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows. Financial arrangements rules When a credit balance of a Specified Deposit Account and a debit balance of the offset portion of the home loan are “offset”, no amount of consideration is paid or payable because of that “offset” for the calculation of income and expenditure under ss EW 15 and EW 31 of the “financial arrangements rules” (as defined in s EW 1(2)). Resident withholding tax (RWT), non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) and approved issuer levy (AIL) Under the “offsetting” feature of the Product, the following apply: a) There is no payment of or entitlement to “interest” (as defined in s YA 1) for the credit balance of a Specified Deposit Account, and no obligation to deduct RWT or NRWT or pay AIL, except to the extent that the credit balance exceeds the debit balance of the offset portion of the home loan. b) To the extent that interest is credited to a Specified Deposit Account: i) RWT and NRWT (as defined in s YA 1) must be deducted by the Bank from the interest credited to the Specified Deposit Account in accordance with the RWT rules (as defined in ss RE 1(1) and YA 1) and the NRWT rules (as defined in ss RF 1(1) and YA 1); and ii) for an account that is a “registered security” (as defined in s 86F of 5 UNCLASSIFIED the SCDA), “approved issuer levy” (as defined in s 86F of the SCDA) may be paid by an “approved issuer” (as defined in s 86F of the SCDA) for the interest credited to that account pursuant to ss 86F and 86I of the SCDA. Section CC 7 No income arises under s CC 7 for the Bank or its customers in relation to the Arrangement. Section BG I Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 October 2018 and ending on 30 September 2022. This Ruling is signed by me on the 15 November 2018. Vasu Naidu Group Lead, Customer Compliance - Significant Enterprises
UNCLASSIFIED PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 18/07 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Persons who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by: • Millwood Forest LP • Glenwood Forest LP • Goodwood Forest LP • Homewood Forest LP • Longwood Forest LP • Majestic Pine Forest LP Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BD 3(2), BG 1, CB 24, CB 25 and GC 2. For the avoidance of doubt this Ruling does not consider or rule on the application of ss DP 11 or EI 1 to the Arrangement. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the formation of an unincorporated joint venture by six limited partnerships (Millwood Forest LP, Glenwood Forest LP, Goodwood Forest LP, Homewood Forest LP, Longwood Forest LP and Majestic Pine Forest LP) (Forestry Partnerships) who each own a forest in the Emerald Hills Forest Estate in order to facilitate the efficient and effective harvest of their timber. Prior to the commencement of the harvest the land owned by each of the Forestry Partnerships will be transferred to a new limited partnership to allow the planting of the second rotation of trees on that land. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Introduction 1. The Forestry Partnerships each own an adjoining parcel of land in the Emerald Hills Forest Estate (Emerald Hills Forest) situated southwest of Gisborne, which 2 UNCLASSIFIED was planted with Radiata pine in the early 1990s. These parcels combine to make a total forestry block of approximately 2,379 net stocked hectares. 2. The following map shows the total forestry block and the boundaries between the land parcels owned by the individual limited partnerships. 3. Each of the Forestry Partnerships is a separate managed investment scheme (MIS) registered under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and regulated by the Financial Markets Authority. Forest Enterprises Limited (FEL) is the manager of the six forestry blocks as well as being the licensed manager (under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013) of each MIS. 4. FEL has commenced, or is ready to commence, harvesting the six forests owned by the Forestry Partnerships. It is anticipated that the harvest will extend over a period of nine to ten years. 5. For reasons detailed below (see paras 18 to 20), the Forestry Partnerships and FEL consider that it is almost impossible (both practically and commercially) to harvest the six forests individually. For that reason FEL is proposing the collective harvest of all six forests (Collective Harvest). Practically this means disregarding the boundaries between the six component forestry blocks and undertaking the harvest as a single commercial venture. 6. Any collective arrangement entered into to achieve the harvest must respect each Forestry Partnership’s discrete stand-alone status as a MIS and also respect the investment objectives set out in the original Prospectuses. Undertaking the Collective Harvest by way of a joint venture will maintain the stand-alone status of each MIS. Therefore, it is proposed that the Collective Harvest will be undertaken 3 UNCLASSIFIED as an unincorporated joint venture (UJV) governed by a joint venture agreement (JVA). 7. The UJV will preserve the following fundamental characteristics of the Forestry Partnerships’ investment: • A single rotation investment with harvest occurring at the end of the investment period; • A boutique investment primarily for personal investors, family trusts and closely held companies; • An investment which provides personal ownership and control by the investors; and • An investment which can be visited and enjoyed first hand, rather than being only on paper. 8. To effect the Collective Harvest, each of the Forestry Partnerships will authorise the collective harvest of their mature trees by entering into the UJV by signing the JVA. 9. The Collective Harvest will necessitate each of the Forestry Partnerships to grant themselves a forestry right (Forestry Right), which will separate the ownership of trees from the underlying land on which the trees are planted. Prior to the Collective Harvest the land owned by each of the Forestry Partnerships will be transferred into a new limited partnership. 10. The draft JVA was provided to Inland Revenue on 8 October 2018. The terms and conditions of the final signed version of the JVA will not differ in any material respect from the version provided to Inland Revenue. 11. The parties to the JVA are the Forestry Partnerships and FEL as the manager. The relationship between these entities is that of contracted parties. Under the JVA each Forestry Partnership will continue as an autonomous investment entity but will agree to exchange the revenue arising from the harvest of 100% of the forest on their land for the right to an agreed percentage share of the revenue arising from the Collective Harvest by the joint venture. 12. The JVA sets out the background to the joint venture as follows: BACKGROUND A. Each of the Participants is a limited partnership registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 which owns the land (the “Land”) and approximate area of mature radiata pine forest as set out in Schedule 1. These areas of mature radiata pine forest are identified in the forest maps in Schedule 2. The areas of mature radiata pine forest are referred to individually as their “Participant Forest” and collectively as the “Participant Forests”. B. Each of the Participants is also a managed investment scheme registered under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 with the name and registration number set out in Schedule 1. Forest Enterprises Limited is the licensed manager of each Participant’s managed investment scheme. C. Each Participant has been authorised (by special resolution passed by the shareholders of its general partner, as set out in Schedule 3 (the “Special 4 UNCLASSIFIED Resolutions”)) to enter into and perform this joint venture for the benefit of their on- going managed investment scheme. D. The Participants now wish to implement the actions authorised by the relevant Special Resolutions by entering into this joint venture for the collective harvest of their Participant Forests by the Manager which will result in each Participant receiving an agreed share of the proceeds from the harvest of the Participant Forests. The Participant Forests are collectively known as the Emerald Hills Group of forests; therefore, the joint venture is named the Emerald Hills Group Harvest Joint Venture (or the “Joint Venture”). E. The Joint Venture is exclusively for the collective harvest of the Participant Forests and distribution of the proceeds of sale of such collective harvest to the Participants in the agreed shares set out in this Agreement. Therefore, to secure the financial interests of the Participants in the Joint Venture separately from their financial interests in their Land they have agreed to create forestry rights with identical terms and to allow an encumbrance in favour of the other Participants over their forestry right. F. The Participants have agreed to cooperate for the benefit of their separate businesses by entering into this Joint Venture the basis and terms of which are set out in this Agreement. History of Emerald Hills 13. FEL contracted to purchase Emerald Hills Station, a 2,836-hectare property, in 1992. Settlement was in three equal tranches: • 17 December 1993: title for the Glenwood and Millwood blocks transferred; • 31 March 1994: title for the Longwood, Pinewood (later renamed Majestic Pine) and Goodwood blocks transferred; and • 30 June 1994: title for the Homewood block transferred (as well as titles to the residual blocks). 14. Settlement related to the release of the six forestry blocks (which became investments) which were subdivided from the total property. Various houses and related station improvements (woolshed, yards etc) which were not included in the investments were sold off separately by FEL. 15. The Prospectuses for the six investments were registered progressively as follows: Investment name Prospectus registration date Millwood 24 September 1993 Glenwood 15 October 1993 Longwood 3 December 1993 Majestic Pine 25 February 1994 Goodwood 18 March 1994 Homewood 6 May 1994 16. Each of the six investments was fully subscribed for in relatively quick succession, as reflected by the close sequence of prospectus registration dates. 17. The Forestry Partnerships all commenced as partnerships of qualifying companies and subsequently transitioned to limited partnerships (as a result of the 5 UNCLASSIFIED enactment of the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010, which repealed the Loss Attributing Qualifying Company regime). Background to undertaking the forest harvest 18. In planning for the harvest, FEL has taken account of the significant other areas of 1990's planted forest outside of FEL's management that will also require harvesting. The Forestry Partnerships and FEL consider it is likely that all 1990 forest areas (not just those managed by FEL) are going to be competing for: • Harvest infrastructure - including logging, roading and cartage contractors. • Access to sensitive roads - some roads are not able to be used in winter or have restricted access in winter. • Limited domestic market options in the Gisborne area. There is a mill located outside of Wairoa that requires small volumes of logs, but this mill is better serviced from the harvest of other forests. The large Juken New Zealand mill on the outskirts of the city of Gisborne seldom buys third party logs as they own a substantial forest resource. Consequently, almost all the logs from the Collective Harvest of the Emerald Hills Forest will be exported. • Limited port space for the large percentage of logs that must be exported. FEL's harvest program scheduling in the Gisborne region is predicated on the second berth development proposed for the Eastland Port occurring. Following this development, FEL estimates that it will then be able to export a maximum of 750,000 tonnes per annum through the Eastland Port. Based upon the port's expected maximum capacity, the Collective Harvest of the Emerald Hills Forests will take nine to ten years starting when the oldest trees are 24 years old (in 2018) and finishing when the trees will be 34 years old (in 2028). • Potentially limited market uptake. 19. FEL is also mindful of the increasing impact of changing legislative requirements including: • Resource Management Act 1991—the prospect of harvest quotas per river catchment, and maximum continuous clearfell areas per annum. • Health and safety regulation - incentivising more machinery and less labour requiring different relationships with harvest contractors who have more capital invested. 20. FEL also needs to resolve the impact of the following factors that will affect the harvest of the Forestry Partnerships’ forests: • Each Forestry Partnership has a relatively large forest area in just two or three age classes - consequently it is not possible to harvest each age class at the selected optimum age (historically around age 28 years). • The Forestry Partnerships' forest areas are contiguous. This arose from the historical consequence of the legislative environment necessitating the subdivision of farms purchased for investments into multiple MIS. However, this gives rise to material boundary issues and it is recognised that the most efficient harvest will be achieved by ignoring these artificial boundaries. 6 UNCLASSIFIED • Vulnerability to access from one public road. However, by collective harvesting, FEL will have the choice of three major and two minor road connections and therefore the ability to operate via any of these depending upon weather, status of the internal roads and other circumstances. 21. The circumstances described in paras 18 to 20 mean that it is extremely impractical (nearing practically and commercially impossible) to harvest the six forests individually. However, a Collective Harvest will mean that the combined operation will be of sufficient scale to attract the interest of major contractors across the whole gamut of harvesting and log sale service providers. This means that FEL will be able to interact with the service providers in a way that translates into further economies and value to the Forestry Partnerships. 22. This larger scale also enables FEL to attract top forestry professionals to manage the harvest, plus enter into logistics solutions in conjunction with transportation providers and the ports. FEL's role and responsibilities 23. FEL’s obligation in respect of the Forestry Partnerships is to act in accordance with the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, the governing documents, and the Statement of Investment Policy and Objectives (SIPO). 24. The investment objective for the Forestry Partnerships is expressed in the SIPO as follows: Investment Objectives - Primary Assets The investment focus is on the Primary Assets as they contribute most to the investment return. Treecrop Of the two Primary Assets, the Treecrop is projected to contribute the largest portion of the investment return. The return generated from the harvest of the TreeCrop is enhanced by the silviculture operations performed on the trees (pruning and thinning operations), plus the quality of the harvest management. The investment objectives for the Treecrop are - 1. To maximise the eventual return from the TreeCrops harvest by undertaking industry best practice silviculture operations identified as being able to add value to the Treecrop; and 2. To maximise the return at harvest by using industry best practice harvest methods identified as being able to add value; and 3. To contract with quality service providers able to add value to the silviculture and harvest activities; and 4. To harness the scale and common interests of the investment with those of other investments managed by the Manager to maximise the investment return. 25. FEL has a legal responsibility to act to resolve any known challenges, in addition to its underlying business focus to achieve the best investment outcome for investors. Clause 24.1(h) of the Deed of Scheme Management states that FEL may: 7 UNCLASSIFIED (h) ... enter into any arrangement to profit sharing union of interest, amalgamation, co-operation, joint venture, reciprocal concessions, licensing, distribution or otherwise with any person which is consistent with the Plan \[The Plan means the plan for planting, tending, maintaining, managing, harvesting trees on the land and carrying away any forest produce set out in the Prospectus\] and the objects of the Limited Partnership and which will directly or indirectly benefit the Limited Partnership and to take or otherwise acquire or deal in choses in action, choses in possession, shares in securities of any such person and to sell, hold, reissue with or without guarantee or otherwise deal with the same and to grant licences and rights to any property of the Limited Partnership to any such person; Collective Harvest by Unincorporated Joint Venture 26. Collective harvesting as a UJV means there will be no regard to each Forestry Partnership's forest boundaries. Harvesting will be focused on the most cost- effective harvest of the entire area of joint venture forest, regardless of which of the Forestry Partnerships is the legal owner of the trees. Details of the Collective Harvest 27. While the typical harvesting age of Radiata pine is 28 years, harvesting of the Emerald Hills Forest will begin early (before the oldest trees are 28 years) and finish late (after the youngest trees are 28 years). All other factors being equal, the quantum of stumpage per hectare will be less but early for the younger trees harvested and more but later for the older trees harvested. The balance between early and late harvest is targeted to achieve an average age of the trees at harvest of the original Prospectus target of around 28 years. 28. Collective Harvest in this manner over nine to ten years creates the environment for each Forestry Partnership to resolve as best possible the known harvesting challenges and achieve the targeted objectives. 29. The objective of the Collective Harvest joint venture is specifically: • To ensure the forest of each Forestry Partnership is able to be harvested; • To maximise the opportunity for a better (more profitable) harvest outcome for each Forestry Partnership; • To minimise all risks for each Forestry Partnership, including crop, access to domestic markets and access to port; • To aim to achieve an average age at harvest of approximately 28 years (reflecting the original expectation in the relevant Prospectus for each Forestry Partnership). 30. The objective is also to endeavour to meet the investors' expectations around timing of harvest, and therefore the timing of payment of the investment return. To a degree this objective has to be compromised to achieve the other objectives. However, the UJV will finish the Collective Harvest no later than four years after the harvest conclusion expectation set out in the relevant Prospectus. Directly or indirectly, achieving the targeted objectives should translate into increased return or less risk of reduced return from the harvest. 8 UNCLASSIFIED Terms of the joint venture 31. Each of the Forestry Partnerships will enter into the JVA to facilitate the Collective Harvest and will accordingly be a joint venturer. 32. Under the JVA the Forestry Partnerships will agree to collectively harvest their forests. Conditions precedent to the commencement of the UJA are that: • Each of the Forestry Partnerships will grant themselves a forestry right (Forestry Right) under the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 (FRR Act), which has the effect of separating the mature first rotation trees from the land on which the trees stand, as the joint venture is specific to the Collective Harvest of the trees. Clause 1 of the JVA states: 1 Forestry Right 1.1 Creation of Forestry Right It is a condition precedent prior to this Agreement coming into effect that each Participant creates a forestry right in favour of the Participant over its own Land in respect of the Participant’s Forest in accordance with section 2A of the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 and to register the forestry right against the title of the Participant’s Land in accordance with the Land Transfer Act 1952. 1.2 Form of Forestry Right The forestry right to be created under clause 1.1 shall be in the form set out in in Schedule 5. 1.3 Variation or Surrender of Forestry Right No forestry right created under clause 1.1 may be varied, surrendered or transferred without the prior written consent of the other Participants. • Each of the Forestry Partnerships will execute an encumbrance (Encumbrance) that will be registered under the Property Law Act 2007 over that Forestry Partnership’s Forestry Right in favour of the other five Forestry Partnerships to secure its obligations under the JVA. Clause 2 of the JVA states: 2 Encumbrance 2.1 Encumbrance over Forestry Right It is a condition precedent prior to this Agreement coming into effect that each Participant executes and registers an encumbrance under the Property Law Act 2007 over that Participants’ forestry right, in favour of the other Participants, to secure performance of that Participant’s obligations under this Agreement. The Manager will ensure that each Participant’s authorised encumbrance is registered. Each Participant covenants that it will not permit any prior third party security interest to subsist in relation to the Participant’s forestry right. 2.2 Form of Encumbrance The encumbrance to be created under clause 2 shall be in the form set out in in Schedule 6. 9 UNCLASSIFIED 33. Clause 3.2 of the JVA sets out the purpose of the joint venture as follows: 3.2 Purpose of Joint Venture The purpose of the Joint Venture is to - (a) enable the Manager to undertake the harvest of all the Participant Forests as one integrated harvesting operation in order to maximise the financial return from harvest and minimise the risks associated with harvest for the shared benefit of the Participants ("Collective Harvest"); and to (b) undertake all business activities incidental to the Collective Harvest. 34. Clause 3.3 of the JVA sets out the joint venture interests (Percentage Share) of each of the Forestry Partnerships as follows: 3.3 Joint Venture Interests The Joint Venture Interests of the Participants are - Participant Percentage Share Glenwood Forest LP 17.3% Goodwood Forest LP 14.9% Homewood Forest LP 18.4% Longwood Forest LP 15.1% Majestic Pine Forest LP 16.0% Millwood Forest LP 18.3% 35. Clause 3.4 of the JVA states that each Forestry Partnership retains ownership of their forest as grantee under that Forestry Partnership’s Forestry Right: 3.4 Participants Scheme Property Subject to clause 3.5, each Participant retains ownership of its Participant Forest as grantee under that Participant's forestry right subject to the encumbrance registered in terms of clause 2 for the benefit of the other Participants, and all other Scheme Property of that Participant's managed investment scheme whether those assets were acquired or accrued before or after the Commencement Date. 36. Clause 3.5 of the JVA states that each Forestry Partnership’s ownership of their forest continues until the point of sale of the harvested logs by FEL, at which time the Forestry Partnership contributes the proceeds of sale of the logs to the UJV as “Joint Venture Property”: 3.5 Participants Joint Venture Property Each Participant's ownership of their Participant Forest as expressed in clause 3.4 continues until the point of sale of the harvested logs by the Manager at which time, the Participant contributes the proceeds of sale of the logs to the Joint Venture as Joint Venture Property. 37. The JVA defines “Joint Venture Property” as follows: 10 UNCLASSIFIED Joint Venture Property means any assets of the Joint Venture from time to time, and includes: (a) cash and amounts receivable; (b) the proceeds of sale of harvest of all Participants’ forests and all rights and receivables in respect of such proceeds; (c) each encumbrance over the forestry right given by each Participant under clause 2.1; and (d) choses in action which may give rise to a debt, revenue, claim or any other right or remedy under this Agreement, - such assets to be held by the Participants as tenants in common according to each Participant’s Percentage Share. 38. Clause 3.6 of the JVA states that all Joint Venture Property is held by the Forestry Partnerships as tenants-in-common in proportion to their joint venture interest: 3.6 Participants Entitlement to Joint Venture Property All Joint Venture Property is held by the Joint Venture Participants as tenants in common in proportion to their Joint Venture Interest. Each Participant is entitled to its Percentage Share of the Joint Venture Property after deduction by the Manager of all Harvest Costs arising from the Collective Harvest. No Participant may claim that it has an entitlement to more than its Percentage Share of the Joint Venture Property after deduction of all Harvest Costs. 39. Clause 3.7 of the JVA states that each Forestry Partnership undertakes to allow FEL with full and unrestricted access to their land for the purpose of the joint venture: 3.7 Unrestricted Access for Collective Harvest Each Participant undertakes to provide the Manager with full and unrestricted access to their Land and Participant Forest for the Purpose of the Joint Venture and authorises the Manager to construct all necessary roads and related infrastructure on the Participant’s Land. 40. Clause 4 of the JVA sets out the relationship principles of the UJV as follows: 4 Relationship Principles 4.1 Principles The Participants recognise that the following relationship principles are important and intend these principles to guide them in their dealings with each other under this Agreement. All Participants are expected to observe the following principles at all times: (a) work together in good faith to enable the Joint Venture (through the Manager) to achieve the Purpose while recognising each other’s separate business and investment interests; (b) work together cooperatively and constructively to give effect to the terms and conditions set out in this Agreement; and (c) observe high standards of integrity and fair dealing with each other. 4.2 Covenants 11 UNCLASSIFIED Each Participant covenants and agrees with the other Participants: (a) To diligently observe and perform its obligations and commitments in respect of the Joint Venture and pursuant to this Agreement; (b) To make their Participant Forest available for the Purpose of the Joint Venture. 41. Clause 5 of the JVA sets out the term (Term) of the joint venture as follows: 5 Term of Joint Venture 5.1 Term Unless the Participants unanimously agree otherwise, the Joint Venture shall commence on the Commencement Date and remain in effect until: (a) completion of Collective Harvest of the Participant Forests subject to the discretion of the Manager not to harvest any areas which do not contribute to the Purpose of the Joint Venture; and (b) distribution by the Manager of all the Joint Venture Property arising from the Collective Harvest to the Participants in their Percentage Shares after deduction of all Harvest Costs. 42. Clause 15 of the JVA states that the JVA concludes at the end of the Term: 15 Winding Up 15.1 Winding Up at End of Term This agreement concludes at the end of the Term. 43. Clause 6.1 of the JVA provides for the equitable treatment of any harvesting undertaken by any of the Forestry Partnerships prior to commencement of the JVA (noting that harvest may be required to commence before the JVA is practicably able to be executed): 6.1 Harvesting Prior to Commencement The Participants agree that where harvesting has occurred in a Participant Forest prior to the commencement of this Agreement the Manager will adjust the payments and accounting for the Participant Shares such that at the earliest possible date following the Commencement Date the Percentage Share of each Participant will be correctly aligned. 44. Clause 8.1 of the JVA states that the agreement does not create or constitute a partnership between the Forestry Partnerships: 8 No Partnership 8.1 No Relationship of Partnership or Agency Nothing in this Agreement shall create or constitute or be deemed to create or constitute a partnership between the Parties, nor to constitute or create, or be deemed to create or constitute a Participant as an agent of any other Participant for any purpose whatsoever. 12 UNCLASSIFIED Terms of the Forestry Rights 45. Each of the Forestry Partnerships (as grantor) will grant themselves (as grantee) a Forestry Right under the FRR Act. 46. Schedule 5 of the JVA contains the terms and conditions of the Forestry Rights and relevantly provides: WHEREAS: A. The Grantor is the registered proprietor of the Land described in Schedule 1. B. The Grantor wishes to create a forestry right in favour of itself over the area delineated on the plan in Schedule 3 (“the Forestry Block”) on the terms of this forestry right instrument. ... 1 GRANTEE’S RIGHTS 1.1 In consideration of the covenants and conditions on the part of the Grantee and the Grantor expressed or implied in this Forestry Right the Grantor transfers and grants to the Grantee for the term specified in Schedule 2 a Forestry Right within the meaning of the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 being the rights to: (a) Manage, harvest, carry away, sell or otherwise utilise all mature (or soon to be mature) trees, timber and logs growing on the Forestry Block for the exclusive benefit of the Grantee.

Prior to the transfer of the land to the new limited partnership both the grantor and the grantee of the Forestry Right will be the relevant Forestry Partnership. Terms of the Encumbrances 48. Each of the Forestry Partnerships will execute an Encumbrance that will be registered under the Property Law Act 2007 over that Forestry Partnership’s Forestry Right in favour of the other five Forestry Partnerships. 49. Schedule 6 of the JVA sets out the terms and conditions of the Encumbrances which are contained in the Encumbrance Instrument which relevantly provides: Encumbrancer Goodwood Forest LP Encumbrancee Glenwood Forest LP Homewood Forest LP Longwood Forest LP Majestic Pine Forest LP Millwood Forest LP Estate or interest to be encumbered Forestry Right ... Encumbrance The Encumbrancer encumbers for the benefit of the Encumbrancees the Forestry Right in the above computer register(s) with the above sum of money, annuity or rent charge, to be raised and paid in accordance with the terms set out in the Annexure Schedule and so as to incorporate in this Encumbrance the terms and other provisions set out in the Annexure Schedule for the better securing to the Encumbrancees the payment(s) secured by this Encumbrance, and compliance by the Encumbrancer with the terms of this encumbrance. ... ANNEXURE SCHEDULE BACKGROUND A. The Encumbrancer is the grantee under a Forestry Right registered against the Land. 14 UNCLASSIFIED B. The Encumbrancer has entered into a Joint Venture Agreement dated \[ \] with the Encumbrancees to enable collective harvest of the first rotation trees on the respective parcels of land over which the Encumbrancer and Encumbrancees have been granted Forestry Rights. C. The Encumbrancer enters into and registers this Encumbrance to secure its obligations under the Joint Venture Agreement. COVENANTS AND CONDITIONS ... 2. Encumbrance The Encumbrancer encumbers the Forestry Right for the benefit of Encumbrancees for a term of 20 years with an annual rent charge of $10.00 to be paid on 1st June each year if demanded by that date. If, during the period preceding 1 June 2019 and each successive 12 months there shall have been no breach of the covenants contained in this Encumbrance, then the annual rent charge payable in respect of that twelve-month period shall be deemed to have been paid. 3. Covenants The Encumbrancer acknowledges and covenants with the Encumbrancees that it will comply with its obligations under the Joint Venture Agreement. 4. Implied terms a.

For the avoidance of doubt the Encumbrancees agree to discharge the Encumbrance upon the occurrence of any of the events in (a) – (c) above. 15 UNCLASSIFIED Calculation of Collective Harvest Percentage Share 50. Income derived by the limited partners of the Forestry Partnerships from the sale of timber as part of the Collective Harvest will be based on each Forestry Partnership's share of the joint income (Percentage Share) received from the harvest for the year. 51. The underlying principle behind sharing the total revenue from the Collective Harvest is that the Forestry Partnerships will be better off receiving a Percentage Share of the total revenue from the Collective Harvest of the Emerald Hill Forests, rather than 100% of the revenue from the harvest of their individual forest. 52. The Percentage Share that each of the Forestry Partnerships will receive of the net harvest proceeds is calculated based on the relevant Forestry Partnership's “Forest Crop Value” (Forest Crop Value) - which is prescribed by IAS 41: Agriculture as it relates to biological assets. Each Forestry Partnership will agree to share the total revenue and expenditure from the Collective Harvest in accordance with the relevant Forestry Partnership's Forest Crop Value, as a percentage of the total Emerald Hills Forest, Forest Crop Value. 53. Specifically, the Percentage Share will be calculated as follows: Percentage share = Forest Crop Value of the relevant Forestry Partnership Total Forest Crop Value for all Forestry Partnerships 54. To illustrate, the table below estimates the Percentage Share for each of the Forestry Partnerships using approximate Forest Crop Values from September 2017: Forest Approx Forest Crop Value (Sept 2017) Percentage Share Goodwood $7,333.093 14.9% Majestic Pine $7,880,138 16.0% Millwood $8,979,432 18.3% Glenwood $8,521,282 17.3% Longwood $7,441,028 15.1% Homewood $9,044,131 18.4% $49,169,104 100.00% 55. The benefit of using Forest Crop Value is because the methodology is: • Prescribed by IAS 41: Agriculture, the accounting standard for valuation of biological assets. • Complies with the New Zealand Institute of Forestry valuation standard. 56. The final calculation will use a subset of each Forestry Partnership's projected cashflow (gross of tax) to which an appropriate discount rate will be applied. 57. In terms of the process used to come up with the Forest Crop Value, FEL will prepare the forestry and other inputs and enter these into each Forestry Partnership’s cashflow to calculate the resulting shares for each Forestry 16 UNCLASSIFIED Partnership in the joint venture. The assumptions for the forestry inputs are reviewed by the Forestry Auditor, and the cashflow amounts (being the calculated Forest Crop Value and the resulting shares of the Collective Harvest joint venture revenue) are reviewed by the Financial Auditor. 58. Following this, FEL will prepare and circulate a report to the investors to enable them to vote on the Collective Harvest joint venture proposal. 59. The key measure against which the calculated harvest shares is reported is a comparison with the percentage of net stocked areas of each Forestry Partnership in the joint venture. This is because, all other factors being equal, the percentage allocation of harvest to each Forestry Partnership should be the same percentage as the net stocked area. The differences in the calculated Percentage Shares is then explained and rationalised with reference to the actual hard data relating to valid actual differences between each Forestry Partnership’s forest in the joint venture. 60. The expected timing of the Collective Harvest is a period of around nine to ten years. Accordingly, in each of those years, the Forestry Partnerships will harvest and dispose of timber to third parties. Each Forestry Partnership will be required to calculate and return their Percentage Share of the joint income arising from the sale of timber (net of their share of allowable deductions). Under the JVA, the Percentage Share of joint income and deductions for the year will be based on the respective Forestry Partnership’s Forest Crop Value percentages. 61. The amount of the Percentage Share paid to each Forestry Partnership in a tax year will be a net amount after deduction by FEL of all Harvest Costs (as defined in the JVA) arising from the Collective Harvest. Transfer of land 62. While the original Prospectuses only contemplated the land being planted and harvested once (ie, a single rotation), once the Collective Harvest has been completed it has been acknowledged that a replant of the areas harvested (the "cut- over") must occur for the following reasons: • The consent received from the Gisborne District Council to harvest the mature trees requires the cut-over to be replanted within 18 months of harvest; • The Climate Change Response Act 2002 requires the forest areas defined as “Pre-1990 Forest” to be replanted in forest or the deemed pollution consequences (carbon emissions) accounted for and paid by the surrender of New Zealand Units (NZUs). The Forestry Partnerships do hold Pre-1990 Forests, and therefore if they are not replanted, NZUs would have to be surrendered; and • The value of the land is enhanced by replanting the second rotation as soon as possible – ie, the best and most economic land use is a crop of plantation Radiata pine trees, not the regrowth pine and weed species which will otherwise naturally regenerate. 63. This Collective Harvest may result in changes in the value and options available in respect of the underlying land which may favour certain Forestry Partnerships 17 UNCLASSIFIED over others. This is because the Collective Harvest will affect the order in which the subsequent replant for the second rotation occurs. 64. To ensure all Forestry Partnerships are treated equitably, the land will be transferred at market value to a new limited partnership after the Forestry Rights have been granted, but before the Collective Harvest begins. The new limited partnership will grant rights of way over its land, which will authorise FEL passing over the land as required to complete the harvest. 65. The original investors are not required to participate in the second rotation planting. This is consistent with the expectation set out in the original Prospectuses (and in each Annual report), which prescribed that the investment can be wound up at the conclusion of harvest and the investors paid out in full. 66. This Ruling does not consider or rule on: • the transfer of the Forestry Partnerships’ land to the new limited partnership and subsequent planting and harvesting of the second rotation tree crop on the land, or • the entry and exit of partners into and out of the new limited partnership. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) The creation of the Forestry Rights does not give rise to income for the limited partners of the Forestry Partnerships under s CB 24. b) The registration of Encumbrances over the Forestry Rights does not give rise to income for the limited partners of the Forestry Partnerships under s CB 24. c) The pooling of the Forestry Rights in the UJV does not give rise to income for the limited partners of the Forestry Partnerships under s CB 24. d) The Arrangement does not give rise to income for the limited partners of the Forestry Partnerships under s CB 25. e) Income from the disposal of timber as part of the Collective Harvest is derived by the Forestry Partnerships’ limited partners under s BD 3(2) during the year in which the proceeds from the disposal of the timber become due and payable to the Forestry Partnerships. f) Section GC 2 does not apply to the Arrangement. g) Section BG 1 does not apply to vary or negate the conclusions above. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 January 2018 and ending on 31 March 2028. 18 UNCLASSIFIED This Ruling is signed by me on the 27 th day of November 2018.

PUB 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED BINDING RULINGS PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 19/01: INCOME TAX – SALARY AND WAGES PAID IN CRYPTO-ASSETS This is a public ruling made under s 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of s RD 3. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the payment of remuneration to an employee in crypto-assets in circumstances where the crypto-asset payments: • are for services performed by the employee under an employment agreement; • are for a fixed amount; and • form a regular part of the employee’s remuneration. This Ruling applies only to salary and wage earners, not self-employed taxpayers; and where the crypto-assets being paid: • are not subject to a “lock-up” period; • can be converted directly into a fiat currency (on an exchange); and either: o a significant purpose of the crypto-asset is to function like a currency; or o the value of the crypto-asset is pegged to one or more fiat currencies. This Ruling does not apply where the crypto-asset provided is a “share” for income tax purposes and is received under an “employee share scheme” as defined in s CE 7. How the taxation law applies to the Arrangement The taxation law applies to the Arrangement as follows: • The crypto-asset payments are “ PAYE income payments” under s RD 3 and are subject to the PAYE rules. 2 PUB 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED The period or tax year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for a period of three years beginning on 1 September 2019.

This Ruling considers the income tax treatment of crypto-assets received by employees as part of their regular remuneration. The commentary discusses when crypto-assets will be treated as part of an employee’s salary or wages and, therefore, be subject to PAYE. It also discusses the implications arising from crypto-asset payments being subject to PAYE (such as potentially affecting an employee’s student loan repayments, Kiwisaver, and Working for Families entitlements). Payments of crypto-assets not subject to PAYE will be fringe benefits and subject to FBT. Background 2. The crypto-asset industry is still evolving and there is currently no standard terminology used. The Ruling uses the term “crypto-asset” to cover digital assets 2 PUB 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED that use cryptography and blockchain technology to regulate their generation and verify transfers. 1 3. It is becoming more common for employees (particularly those working in crypto- asset-related industries) to receive remuneration in crypto-assets. The Commissioner has been asked to provide guidance on how remuneration paid in crypto-assets is taxed. This Ruling sets out the Commissioner’s view on the situation where an employee is regularly paid part of their remuneration in crypto- assets. 4. The Commissioner’s initial views on this issue were set out in issues paper IRRUIP 11: “Whether remuneration paid to an employee in cryptocurrency is subject to PAYE or FBT”, which was released for consultation in June 2018. The submissions received have been taken into account in drafting this Ruling and also the related Ruling “BR PUB 19/02: Income Tax – Bonuses paid in crypto-assets”. Application of the legislation Introduction 5. An agreement to pay an employee in crypto-assets could be structured in two ways. The first way is as an agreed deduction from the employee’s gross salary or wages (where the employee’s after-tax remuneration is, in effect, being traded for a payment of crypto-assets). 2 It is well-settled law that the employee is subject to PAYE on the full amount in this situation. 6. The second way is as a reduction in calculating the employee’s gross salary or wages (also known as a salary sacrifice). The following analysis considers how the provision of crypto-assets will be treated when a salary sacrifice arrangement is valid, in particular, whether PAYE or FBT applies. Whether crypto-assets received under a valid salary sacrifice are subject to PAYE or FBT 7. The first step is to consider whether the payment is subject to PAYE. This is because, to the extent that an employment-related benefit is taxable to an employee, it will not be a fringe benefit (s CX 4). Therefore, if the provision of crypto-assets to an employee falls within the PAYE rules, PAYE will apply even if the FBT rules would also otherwise apply. 8. Section CE 1 sets out the “amounts” that are treated as employment income. Relevantly, these include “salary or wages”: CE 1 Amounts derived in connection with employment Income (1) The following amounts derived by a person in connection with their employment or service are income of the person: (a) salary or wages or an allowance, bonus, extra pay, or gratuity: 1 These are sometimes referred to by other terms including “cryptocurrencies” and “tokens”. 2 The leading case on when a salary sacrifice will be valid is Heaton v Bell \[1970\] AC 728. See also Watts v MNR 61 DTC 592, Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd v Commissioners of Customs and Excise (1992) VATTR 44, and Goodfellow v The Commissioners (1986) VATTR 119. 3 PUB 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED (b) expenditure on account of an employee that is expenditure on account of the person: (bb) the value of accommodation referred to in sections CE 1B to CE 1E: (c) \[Repealed\] (d) a benefit received under a share purchase agreement: (e) directors’ fees: (f) compensation for loss of employment or service: (g) any other benefit in money. \[Emphasis added\] 9. The situation being considered is an employee receiving part of their regular remuneration in crypto-assets. Therefore, the potentially relevant part of s CE 1 is “salary or wages”. 3 10. It could be argued that the reference in paragraph (g) of s CE 1 to “any other benefit in money” supports the view that the paragraphs that come before it were intended to be limited to benefits in money. However, the fact s CE 1(1) includes benefits that are not in money (for example, the value of employer-provided accommodation) could suggest that this is not the case. 11. Also, “amount” “includes an amount in money’s worth” (s YA 1). Therefore, s CE 1 is drafted widely enough to include amounts derived that are “money’s worth” (but not money). However, for crypto-assets (which are money’s worth) to be included, they must also be “salary or wages”. Meaning of “salary” and “wages” 12. “Salary or wages” is defined in s RD 5 for the purposes of the PAYE rules: RD 5 Salary or wages Meaning (1) Salary or wages— (a) means a payment of salary, wages, or allowances made to a person in connection with their employment; and (b) includes— (i) a bonus, commission, gratuity, overtime pay, or other pay of any kind; and .... 13. Neither “salary” nor “wages” is further defined in the Act, so it is necessary to consider their ordinary meanings. 14. “Salary” is relevantly defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (Oxford University Press, 12th ed, 2011) as: a fixed regular payment made usually on a monthly basis by an employer to an employee, especially a professional or white-collar worker. 15. “Wage” is similarly defined as: a fixed regular payment for work, typically paid on a daily or weekly basis. 3 Inland Revenue’s view is that crypto-assets are not “money” (see \[19\] for further discussion of this). Therefore, s CE 1(1)(g) is not relevant in this case. 4 PUB 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED 16. Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Applied Design Development Pty Ltd (in liq) 2002 ATC 4,193 considered the ordinary meaning of “salary” and “wage”. Mansfield J defined the terms in the following way (at 4,195): Of particular importance in the present application is the absence of statutory definitions of the words “salary” or “wage”. In the absence of statutory definitions, meaning should be given to those words according to the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision, and taking into account their context in the legislative scheme and the objects of the Act. The words “salary” and “wage” denote an amount of money payable, the consideration for which is the performance of work or services. That meaning is reflected in the definitions provided for the terms in the Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed: Salary: fixed payment made periodically to a person as compensation for regular work. Wage: a payment to a person for services rendered. I adopt those definitions in the determination of these proceedings. 17. The hallmarks of salary and wages were also discussed in a case on the meaning of “allowance”. In Stagg v IRC \[1959\] NZLR 1252 the Supreme Court referred to the ordinary meaning of an allowance as “sums of money”. The provision in question read: All salaries, wages or allowances (whether in cash or otherwise) including all sums received or receivable by way of bonus, gratuity, extra salary, or emolument of any kind, in respect of or in relation to the employment of the taxpayer. 18. Hutchison ACJ held that the normal meaning of “allowances” was coloured by the words “salary” and “wages” and was to be read consistently with, or in light of, those words. His Honour considered that the characteristics of salaries that have bearing on the meaning of “allowances” were that they are: • for an employment or service; • payable under the contract of service and not as a gratuity (although this factor was affected by the later part of the paragraph that included some gratuities within “salaries, wages, or allowances”); • paid in money (although this factor was affected by the words “whether in cash or otherwise”, which meant non-cash allowances could be paid if they were convertible); and • paid periodically. 19. In summary, this suggests salary and wages are generally considered to be payments that are: • in return for work undertaken; • fixed, ie of a predetermined amount or rate (not, for example, a share of profits); • regular, ie recurring on a regular basis (usually weekly, fortnightly or monthly); and • in money. 20. Where an employee has agreed to receive part of their regular remuneration in the form of crypto-assets, most of these requirements would be met. The payments would be fixed, regular amounts received in return for work undertaken. Crypto- assets can also have many of the characteristics of money; for example, the types 5 PUB 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED of crypto-assets covered by this Ruling are readily transferable mediums of exchange, divisible, fungible, durable and hard to counterfeit. 21. In the Commissioner’s view, crypto-assets are property. Crypto-assets are not “money” as commonly understood (at least not at the present time). In particular, because crypto-assets are not issued by any government, they are not legal tender anywhere. Further, although acceptance of certain crypto-assets as payment for goods and services is increasing, they are not “generally accepted” as payment. Given the extreme volatility experienced to date, there are also issues around some crypto-assets’ ability to be a store of value. Interpretation Act 1999 22. Notwithstanding that crypto-assets are not “money” in the technical sense, it remains to be considered whether the terms “salary” and “wages” in s CE 1 are wide enough to include payments in crypto-assets. Clearly, at the time “salary” and “wages” were first referred to in the Income Tax Act, Parliament would not have contemplated payments of crypto-assets being within the scope of salary and wages as crypto-assets did not exist. 23. However, s 6 of the Interpretation Act 1999 4 provides for an ambulatory approach to statutory interpretation: an enactment applies to circumstances as they arise. 24. This requires old legislation to be interpreted as applying to modern circumstances, that is, the: 5 • new developments to which the Act is to be applied are within the mischief that the Act was meant to cure; and • words of the Act, albeit by liberal interpretation, are capable of covering these new developments. 25. Or, put another way: 6 The Court’s task in deciding such cases is to remain faithful to the original Parliamentary intent, yet to produce a result that is workable in the different world of today. 26. This interpretive approach has been used where technological developments or changes in the way society views something have made old legislation outdated. For example, in R v Walsh \[2007\] 1 NZLR 738, the Court of Appeal applied s 6 of the Interpretation Act 1999 to interpret the meaning of “false document” taking into account the digital age. 7 In R v Misic \[2001\] 3 NZLR 1 the Court of Appeal held that a computer program and disk were documents for the purposes of s 229A of the Crimes Act 1961. 27. Originally, the concept of salary and wages would have been limited to payments in physical notes and coins. Later, payment may have been made by cheque. Now payment is likely to be made by direct credit to an employee’s bank account. As such, the concept of salary and wages has shifted over time with different payment 4 Section 6 replaced s 5(d) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1924. 5 J Burrows and J Fogerty (presenters) “Statutory Interpretation” (New Zealand Law Society seminar, 2011). 6 Bigwood, R (ed) The Statute Making and Meaning (LexisNexis, 2004). 7 The Supreme Court (R v Walsh \[2007\] 2 NZLR 109) later held that such an interpretation was not necessary. 6 PUB 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED methods. Crypto-assets and the blockchain on which they are based have been around since 2009. Crypto-assets have become more widely used in recent times. 28. The question is whether the ordinary meanings of “salary” and “wages” are now wide enough to encompass payments in crypto-assets. Unlike the moves from physical notes and coins to cheques to direct credit (which are all payments of money), the shift to paying in crypto-assets is a more significant one. However, this does not prevent s 6 of the Interpretation Act applying. There is nothing in the Income Tax Act that limits the interpretation of salary and wages to monetary payments. Rather the ordinary meanings apply, and these can change over time. The Commissioner’s view is that the meanings of “salary” and “wages” are capable of including payments in crypto-assets. PAYE generally applies only to monetary benefits 29. The alternative view is “salary” and “wages” should be interpreted narrowly and, consequently, PAYE will not apply. If a payment of crypto-assets was not subject to PAYE, it would be a fringe benefit and subject to FBT 8 . 30. The primary argument for FBT applying is that the scheme of the Income Tax Act suggests that payments in money are subject to PAYE and non-monetary payments are subject to FBT (except where specifically provided for). The PAYE rules apply to “PAYE income payments”, which for employees is defined as a payment of “salary or wages” or an “extra pay”. “Salary or wages” is defined in s RD 5. Most of the items listed are payments that would generally be expected to be made in money. These include salary, wages, allowances, bonuses, commissions, gratuities, and various benefit, grant and compensation payments. However, employer-provided accommodation under s CE 1(1)(bb) is also expressly included. 31. Similarly, “extra pay” is defined in relation to payments that would generally be made in money. However, it also includes a benefit under certain share purchase agreements. 32. It can be seen from this that the Act broadly distinguishes between monetary and non-monetary payments to employees with the former being subject to PAYE and the latter to FBT. The reference in s CE 1(1)(g) to “any other benefit in money” is also consistent with this. However, this distinction is not absolute, with some non- monetary benefits being included in the PAYE rules. It is less clear whether non- monetary benefits that are not expressly included could also be subject to PAYE. Section RD 6 33. Section RD 6 seems to contemplate other non-monetary benefits being subject to the PAYE rules. It provides timing and valuation rules for non-monetary benefits. Relevantly, it applies to: RD 6 Certain benefits and payments When this section applies (1) This section applies when an employee receives— (a) a benefit treated as income under section CE 1(1)(bb) (Amounts derived in connection with employment); or (b) another benefit in kind that is included in their salary or wages; or 8 A crypto-asset payment would satisfy the definition of “fringe benefit” in s CX 2 and not fall within any of the exemptions in subpart CX. 7 PUB 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED (c) 1 or more of the following payments: (i) a superannuation payment: (ii) a pension: (iii) a retiring or other allowance: (iv) an annuity; or (d) a benefit under section CE 2(2) and (4) (Value and timing of benefits under share purchase agreements) in relation to which the employer has made an election under section RD 7B. \[Emphasis added\] 34. As well as including the specific non-monetary benefits (employer-provided accommodation and benefits under share purchase schemes) s RD 6 also provides for other benefits in kind that are included in an employee’s salary or wages. This suggests there may be other situations where non-monetary benefits are included in an employee’s salary and wages for PAYE purposes. However, it is not clear when this will be the case. 35. The original predecessor to s RD 6 (s 9 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1957) was introduced at the same time as the PAYE rules. The wording of the original subsection was: 9 Benefits and superannuation and other payments deemed to be salary and wages— (1) Where in respect of his employment an employee receives a benefit referred to in section eighty-nine of the principal Act 9 , or any other benefit in kind which is included in his salary or wages, or receives a payment by way of superannuation, pension, retiring allowance, or other allowance, or annuity which in included in salary or wages as defined in section two of this Act, the value of the benefit (whether in money or otherwise) or, as the case may be, the amount of the payment shall be deemed to accrue from day to day, and accordingly in each case the amount so accrued for any days in a pay period of the employee shall be deemed to be his salary or wages for the pay period, or, as the case may be, part of his salary or wages for the pay period. \[Footnote and emphasis added\] “Salary or wages” was relevantly defined as meaning “salary, wages, or allowances (whether in cash or otherwise)”. Consistent with the current legislation, the value of accommodation was also included in the definition. The wording has remained broadly similar through to the Income Tax Act 2007. 36. There is limited contemporaneous material discussing what “other benefits in kind” s 9 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1957 was intended to cover. During the second reading of the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1957, Hon. Mr Watts explained clause 9 of the Bill as follows (8 October 1958, 314 NZPD 2,894): Under clause 9 any benefits in kind, for example, the value of a free house, or free meat, or other benefits of that type, are to be taxed at the end of each pay period. If the employee is paid weekly he will also pay on the value of his benefits for the week. Where superannuation is paid and is treated as salary and wages it will be deemed to have accrued from day to day over the period for which it is paid. 37. Many of the taxable benefits that would have been subject to PAYE when s 9 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1957 was enacted will now be subject to FBT. However, the fact s RD 6(1)(b) is included in the current legislation suggests some 9 Section 89 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 included in “assessable income” the value of any employer-provided board, lodging and house allowances. 8 PUB 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED non-monetary benefits (other than those specifically mentioned in other paragraphs of s RD 6(1)) may come within the definition of “salary or wages”. Conclusion 38. It is unclear on the face of the legislation whether an employee who regularly receives a part of their normal remuneration in crypto-assets is subject to PAYE or whether FBT applies. Both views are arguable. 39. Broadly, the scheme of the Act is that consideration in money is subject to PAYE, whereas non-monetary benefits are subject to FBT. Crypto-assets are not money in the technical sense (although they share some of the characteristics of money). This might suggest that payments in crypto-assets should be subject to FBT. However, the distinction between monetary and non-monetary payments is not hard and fast. Statutory exceptions make some non-monetary benefits (such as employer-provided accommodation) subject to PAYE. Further, the PAYE rules are drafted widely enough to potentially include some other non-monetary payments. 40. Ultimately, the issue turns on whether regular payments in crypto-assets come within the ordinary meaning of “salary or wages”. The answer to this is not certain. While a regular payment received in crypto-assets has many of the hallmarks of salary and wages, historically salary and wages have been payments in money. However, s 6 of the Interpretation Act 1999 requires legislation to be interpreted as applying to modern circumstances. While not free from doubt, on balance, the Commissioner’s view is that the concepts of “salary” and “wages” are wide enough to encompass some regular payments in crypto-assets. Consequently, these payments are “salary or wages” under s RD 5. Therefore, they are “PAYE income payments” under s RD 3 and the PAYE rules apply to them. 41. Because the payments are subject to PAYE, the FBT rules will not apply. Which crypto-assets are subject to PAYE? 42. In the Commissioner’s view, not all types of crypto-assets will be subject to PAYE. To be considered “salary or wages” the crypto-assets need to be sufficiently similar to existing notions of salary and wages. In the Commissioner’s view, this will be the case where the crypto-assets have the following features: • They are not subject to a “lock-up” period; • They can be converted directly into a fiat currency (on an exchange); and either: o a significant purpose of the crypto-asset is to function like a currency; or o the value of the crypto-asset is pegged to one or more fiat currencies. 43. Each of these is discussed in more detail below. Taxpayers can contact Inland Revenue if they are having difficulty determining whether a particular crypto-asset satisfies these criteria. 44. For crypto-asset payments that are not subject to PAYE, the FBT rules will apply. Not subject to a “lock-up” period 45. In the Commissioner’s view, crypto-assets that cannot be converted or sold by the employee for a material period of time after payment does not sufficiently resemble a payment of salary or wages. 9 PUB 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED The crypto-assets can be converted directly into a fiat currency 46. Most mainstream crypto-assets can generally be traded on an exchange directly for fiat currency (for example, New Zealand dollars (NZD) or United States dollars). For other crypto-assets, this may not be available. Instead, the crypto-assets must first be converted into a more mainstream crypto-asset (such as bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH)) and then converted into fiat currency. In the current environment where crypto-assets are not readily accepted as payment for goods and services, the Commissioner’s view is that crypto-assets that cannot be converted directly into fiat currency on an exchange (that meets the requirements set out in \[57\] and \[59\]) are not sufficiently “money-like” to be considered salary or wages. A significant purpose of the crypto-assets is to function like a currency 47. The range and functions of crypto-assets have evolved in recent times. It is now possible to get crypto-assets that function in a similar way, for example, to vouchers, shares, or debt securities. 48. Some crypto-assets are designed to function as an alternative to fiat currency in the sense they provide a general-purpose peer-to-peer payment system. Examples are bitcoin, bitcoin Cash (BCH), bitcoin Gold (BTG), and Litecoin (LTC). Some crypto-assets are designed with other functions in addition to use as a currency, but the currency purpose is still a significant one. Ether is a common example of this. The Commissioner’s view is that payment in these types of crypto- assets (where conversion directly into a fiat currency on an exchange is possible) is sufficiently “money-like” to come within the ordinary meaning of salary or wages. 49. These can be contrasted with crypto-assets that are designed primarily for other purposes (for example, filecoin (FIL), Dentacoin (DCN), and CRYPTO20 (C20)). Common examples are: • rights to access, operate, use or control a platform or other property/services (often referred to as “utility tokens”); • providing rights to underlying tradable assets such as precious metals or real estate (often referred to “asset tokens”); and • providing ownership or control of a financial asset (often referred to as “securities tokens”). 50. These crypto-assets can also usually be traded peer-to-peer or on an exchange. Therefore, in a sense, they can function in a similar way to currency. However, this can be seen as the equivalent of trading in gold, shares, or gift cards for example. That is, although they share some of the features of currency, they are not in tended to operate as such. The value of the crypto-assets is pegged to one or more fiat currencies 51. This refers to so-called “stablecoins” that have their value pegged to one or more fiat currencies. Common examples are USD Tether (USDT) and Paxos Standard (PAX). Regardless of whether these crypto-assets are designed to function like currencies (in the sense discussed above at \[47\]–\[50\]) the Commissioner’s view is that payment in a stablecoin (where conversion directly into a fiat currency on an exchange is possible) is sufficiently “money-like” to come within the ordinary meaning of salary or wages. 10 PUB 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED Implications of conclusion PAYE is calculated on the gross basis 52. Where payment is provided in crypto-assets, the employer must gross up the net amount of the crypto-assets provided to the employee when calculating PAYE. 53. Where the employee’s employment contract sets out the gross amount (ie amount before tax is deducted) payable in NZD, this will not be an issue. Assume, for example, an employment contract provides for an employee to be paid $100 (gross) of crypto-assets per week. If the employee is on a 33% tax rate, $67 worth of crypto-assets would be payable to the employee and $33 (NZD) must be paid to Inland Revenue as PAYE. 54. However, where an employment agreement provides for an employee to receive either a net amount of crypto-assets calculated in NZD, or an amount denominated in crypto-assets, then the amount provided to the employee will need to be grossed up when calculating the PAYE payable. This works in the same way as the provision of employer-provided accommodation, where the value of the accommodation is grossed up before PAYE is calculated and paid. Converting crypto-asset payments to NZD 55. Generally, arrangements of this type will provide for an employee to be paid an amount of crypto-assets denominated in NZD. In this case, there will be no need to convert the crypto-assets into NZD to calculate the PAYE payable. 56. However, where a crypto-asset payment is not denominated in NZD (for example, if an employee is paid 0.001 bitcoin per fortnight), it is necessary to calculate the NZD value of the crypto-assets on the date it is paid to the employee. 57. Conversion rates may be obtained from any centralised data repository site that may be listed from time-to-time on the Inland Revenue website. 58. Alternatively, conversion rates may be obtained from a public exchange that has comprehensive know-your-customer/anti -m oney-l aundering procedures in place. Which exchange (or exchanges) is appropriate will depend on the circumstances. Using a New Zealand-based exchange listed on the Financial Service Providers Register will be appropriate. 59. If the appropriate valuation cannot be obtained from a New Zealand-based exchange, an overseas-based exchange can be used. For some “alt coins” (crypto- assets other than bitcoin) it may be necessary to convert into US dollars, or an other fiat currency, and then convert into NZD. 60. Rates can vary significantly between different exchanges and currencies. Therefore, taxpayers should use a consistent exchange and conversion approach (for example, using a consistent time of day to determine the conversion rates). Other implications 61. There are various circumstances where obligations, eligibility, or entitlements may be calculated based on an employee’s salary or wages (for example Kiwisaver, Working for Families Tax Credits, and student loan repayments). The crypto-asset payments must be taken into account when calculating these. 11 PUB 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED Example 62. The following example i s included to help explain the application of the law. Example: Employee paid part of salary in bitcoin 63. Ken is employed by Cryptowonderland Ltd. His salary is NZ$10,000 per month before tax. Half Ken’s salary is payable in NZD direct credited to his bank account. The other half is payable in bitcoin transferred to Ken’s bitcoin wallet. 64. PAYE should be calculated on the $10,000 gross payment and withheld and paid to the Commissioner (in New Zealand dollars). The net amount is payable to Ken. 65. If Ken is a Kiwisaver member or is subject to, for example, child support or student loan deductions, the Employer’s Guide (IR 335) and the PAYE calculator (both available on the Inland Revenue website www.ird.govt.nz) can be used to assist with calculating these.

FEDERAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS ACT (FICA) – FRINGE BENEFIT TAX (FBT) LIABILITY P UBLIC RULING - BR Pub 09/02 Note (not part of ruling): The key issue considered by this ruling is whether employer contributions made by an American employer, to the United States Federal Government in accordance with the US Federal Insurance Contribution Act, give rise to fringe benefit tax under the 2007 Income Tax Act. The conclusion is that such contributions do not give rise to fringe benefit tax. This ruling replaces Public Ruling BR Pub 07/02 which was published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 19, No 3 (April 2007). BR Pub 07/02 applies until 30 June 2009 and is a reissue of Pub 01/05 published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 13, No 7 (July 2001). This new ruling is essentially the same as the previous ruling. However, the new ruling has been updated and applies the Income Tax Act 2007, which came into force on 1 April 2008, instead of the equivalent provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004. The changes between the provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 do not affect the conclusions previously reached. BR Pub 09/02 applies for an indefinite period beginning on 1 July 2009. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. T axation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. T his Ruling applies in respect of sections CX 13, CX 14 and CX 37. T he Arrangement to which this Ruling applies T he Arrangement is the deduction of contributions from wages payable to employees and the payment of these contributions, together with employer contributions, to the United States Federal Government in accordance with the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (“FICA”), by an “American employer” (as defined in FICA) who is required to do so because the employer employs a citizen or citizens of the United States of America. H ow the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement T he Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •E mployer contributions paid under FICA do not give rise to a “fringe benefit” under section CX 13 as the contributions are not made for the benefit of employees. •E mployer contributions paid under FICA do not give rise to a “fringe benefit” under section CX 14. As trust funds established for the purpose of paying disability benefits or Medicare and funded by contributions under FICA were not established for the benefit of employees and have not been approved by the Commissioner, they are no t “ sickness, accident or death benefit funds” as defined in section YA 1. •E mployer contributions paid under FICA do not give rise to an “unclassified benefit” in terms of section CX 37 as a benefit is not provided by employers in connection with 2 the employment of employees through the payment of employer contributions under FICA. •E mployee contributions required to be deducted from wages and paid under FICA do not give rise to an “unclassified benefit” as such contributions represent part of the assessable income of employees and are expressly excluded from the definition of “fringe benefit” by section CX 4. T herefore, payments required under FICA are not subject to fringe benefit tax (“FBT”). T he period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on 1 July 2009. T his Ruling is signed by me on the 30 th day of April 2009. S usan Price Director, Public Rulings 3 C OMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 09/02 T his commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 09/02 (“the Ruling”). Ba ckground The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) is the part of the US Internal Revenue Code under which employers and employees are required to make payments for the funding of social security benefits. In some circumstances an employer who employs an employee to provide services in New Zealand is required to comply with obligations under the FICA legislation. FICA applies when an “American employer” pays wages for services performed as an employee by a US citizen outside the US: sections 3101 and 3111 and the definition of “employment” in section 3121 Internal Revenue Code. “American employer” means the US Government or its instruments, residents of the US or companies that are organised under the laws of the US. I f FICA applies, employers must make deductions from wages payable to an employee in respect of Old-Age Survivors and Disability Insurance (“OASDI”) and Hospital Insurance (known as “Medicare”), and must pay the deductions to the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, employers are required to make payments for OASDI and Medicare (employer contributions) at the same rate. The current rate in respect of OASDI is 6.2 percent and in respect of Medicare the rate is 1.45 percent. An employer who fails to make the required payments or fails to make the payments on time is liable for a penalty. Under FICA amounts deducted from wages payable to employees are deemed to have been paid to employees at the time of deduction (Internal Revenue Code Title 26 USC, Chapter 21, section 3123). FICA does not provide for recovery of OASDI or Medicare payments imposed on employees from an employee where the employer has failed to make deductions. Payments collected under FICA are paid into the US Treasury’s General Fund and are appropriated to three separate funds: the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund; the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund; and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. Amounts held in these funds are not held for any particular individual. A person must be a US citizen or legally resident in the US to be entitled to social security benefits (Public Law 104-193; Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996). Under the US social security legislation (Public Health and Welfare Code, 42 USC Chapter 7) a person must hold not less than 40 credits to be entitled to a retirement benefit. The amount needed to gain a credit changes from year to year. For the year 2009 a credit is gained for every quarter in which an employee earns more than $1090 from employment. No more than four credits can be gained in respect of a year. The minimum age to qualify for a retirement benefit depends on when a person was born. However, a person could qualify for a disability benefit with fewer credits, depending on their age. To be entitled to a disability benefit: 4 •A person must have a medical condition that meets the definition of “disability” in the social security legislation; and •2 0 of the 40 credits required to qualify for a disability benefit must have been earned in the 10 years ending in the year in which the person became disabled. If a person who is covered by social security dies, their surviving spouse or dependent children can receive a survivors benefit. The right to retirement, survivors and disability benefits cannot be assigned or transferred. The amount of the monthly benefit paid depends on the person’s earnings during the person’s working life and the age at which the person retires. The amount of the benefit is calculated according to a formula in the legislation. People aged 65 or older are entitled to receive Medicare benefits if they: •Receive a social security benefit; •Have worked long enough to be eligible for a social security benefi t; •Would be entitled to a social security benefit based on their spouse’s work record and their spouse is aged at least 62; o r •H ave worked long enough in a federal, state or local government job to be insured fo r M edicare. People aged under 65 who receive disability benefits or who have permanent kidney failure may qualify for Medicare. L egislation “Fringe benefit” is defined in section CX 2(1) as follows: A fringe benefit is a benefit that— (a)i s provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment; and (b)e ither— (i)a rises in a way described in any of sections CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12 to CX 16; or (ii)i s an unclassified benefit; and (c)i s not a benefit excluded from being a fringe benefit by any provision of this subpart. Se ction CX 13 provides: (1)A fringe benefit arises when an employer contributes to a superannuation scheme for the benefit of an employee . (2)This section does not apply if the contribution is an employer’s superannuation contribution. Se ction CX 14 provides: A fringe benefit arises when an employer makes a contribution for the benefit of an employee to a sickness, accident, or death benefit fund. “Unclassified benefit” is defined in section CX 37 as follows: 5 Unclassified benefit means a fringe benefit that arises if an employer provides an employee with a benefit in connection with their employment that is— (a)not a benefit referred to in any of sections CX 6 to CX 16; and (b)no t a benefit excluded under this subpart. Se ction CX 4 provides: To the extent to which a benefit that an employer provides to an employee in connection with their employment is assessable income, the benefit is not a fringe benefit. “Superannuation scheme” is defined in section YA 1 as follows: superannuation scheme— (a)m eans— (i)a trust or unit trust established by its trust deed mainly for the purposes of providing retirement benefits to beneficiaries who are natural persons or paying benefits to superannuation funds; or (ii)(r epealed) (iii)a company that is not a unit trust, is not resident in New Zealand, and is established mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to members or relatives of members who are natural persons; or (iv)a n arrangement constituted under an Act of the Parliament of New Zealand, other than the Social Security Act 1964, mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to natural persons; or (v)a n arrangement constituted under the legislation of a country, territory, state, or local authority outside New Zealand mainly for the purpose of providing retireme nt b enefits to natural persons; and (b)f or a superannuation scheme that is a trust, means the trustees of the scheme. T he definition of “arrangement” in section YA 1 reads as follows: Arrangement means an agreement, contract, plan or understanding, whether enforceable or unenforceable, including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect. The definition of “sickness, accident or death benefit fund” in section YA 1 reads as follows: sickness, accident, or death benefit fund means a sickness, accident, or death benefit fund that is — (a)established for the benefit of— (i)em ployees; or (ii)t he members of an incorporated society; or (iii)the surviving spouses and dependants of those employees or members; and (b)a pproved by the Commissioner A pplication of the legislation 6 Liability for FBT Whether an employer is required to pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) in respect of either employer or employee contributions made under FICA depends on whether the employer has provided a “fringe benefit” (section RD 26(1)). There will be a “fringe benefit” where: •A benefit arises in a way described in any of section CX 6, section CX 9, section CX 10 or sections CX 12 to CX 16 or a benefit of any other type is provided by an employe r t o an employee in connection with their employment (an “unclassified benefit”); an d •The benefit is not excluded from being a fringe benefit by any provision of subpart CX. I n Australian cases, in the FBT context, the courts have considered that a fringe benefit will not be provided unless there is a link between the benefit and a particular employee: see Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2002) ATC 5201; Walstern v Commissioner of Taxation 2003 ATC 5076; Cameron Brae Pty Ltd v FCT 2006 ATC 4433. The Commissioner considers that this principle also applies in the New Zealand context. As with the Australian legislation, the wording of the legislation suggests that it contemplates a benefit provided to a particular employee. The definition of “fringe benefit” in section CX 2(1) refers to “a benefit that is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment”. Sections CX 13 and CX 14 also refer to “a contribution for the benefit of an employee”. As with the Australian legislation, under the valuation provisions any payment made by the employee is to be taken into account in determining the taxable value of the fringe benefit. The need for a link between the benefit and an employee is consistent with the purpose of the FBT provisions. FBT was intended to apply to non-cash remuneration provided to an employee and although liability for FBT is imposed on the employer, the theoretical basis for the imposition of FBT is that it is payable in respect of amounts that are essentially (or would be) income of an employee. C ontributions to superannuation scheme: section CX 13 Under section CX 13 a fringe benefit arises when an employer makes a contribution to a superannuation scheme (other than an employer’s superannuation contribution) for the benefit of an employee. The definition of “superannuation scheme” in section YA 1 includes an arrangement constituted under the legislation of a country, territory, state or local authority outside New Zealand mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to natural persons (paragraph (a)(v) of the definition). S uperannuation scheme T he definition of “superannuation scheme” specifically includes an arrangement constituted under legislation. FICA requires employer and employee contributions to fund social security benefits, including retirement benefits. The US social security legislation contains the provisions relating to eligibility for retirement benefits and the payment of retirement benefits. These two pieces of legislation together establish a system for the funding and payment of social security benefits, including retirement benefits. Therefore, there is an arrangement that is constituted under US legislation (the US social security legislation and FICA). 7 The Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund were established under US Code Title 42 Public Health and Welfare Code, Chapter 7 Social Security, Subchapter II, section 401). Under the US social security legislation an amount equal to 100 percent of the amount collected from employees and employers in respect of OASDI is appropriated to those trust funds (42 USC, section 401). Monthly retirement benefits and survivors benefits are paid out of the Federal Old- Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and benefits to disabled workers and their families are paid out of the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. The social security legislation sets out the conditions for entitlement to retirement benefits and provides for the payment of retirement benefits (42 USC, section 402). For paragraph (a)(v) of the definition of “superannuation scheme” to apply, the arrangement must be mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits. Payments under FICA are appropriated to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and are to be used for the purpose of funding retirement benefits. Survivors’ benefits are also paid out of the fund to the widows, widowers and children of people who would have been entitled to receive a retirement benefit (that is, benefits could be paid out of the trust fund to people who have not reached retirement age). However, such people would be entitled to receive a benefit only if a person who qualifies for a retirement benefit has died. The principal object of creating the trust fund is to provide for the payment of retirement benefits. FICA is part of a legislative scheme for the provision of social security benefits by the US Federal Government, which is the equivalent of provision of benefits under the New Zealand Social Security Act 1964. In Roe v Social Security Commission (10 April 1987) (unreported, High Court, Wellington, M 270/86, Davison CJ) the plaintiff was the recipient of a social security retirement benefit paid by the US Government. The issue was whether the benefit formed part of a programme providing benefits, pensions or periodical allowances for any of the contingencies for which benefits, pensions or allowances could be paid under the New Zealand Social Security Act. Davison CJ commented: The US retirement benefit is clearly on the evidence a benefit paid by the US Government of the same type as a NZ national superannuation benefit. Both are paid by the respective Governments and both are part and parcel of programmes for assistance to age-related beneficiaries. (p. 8) The Commissioner considers that payments made under FICA and appropriated to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund are paid under an arrangement constituted under US legislation mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to natural persons. Therefore, there is a superannuation scheme that is constituted under the social security legislation and FICA in terms of paragraph (a)(v) of the definition of “superannuation scheme”. This differs from the view expressed in the Commissioner’s first ruling on this issue (BR Pub 01/05). However, for section CX 13 to apply, payments made by employers under FICA must be contributions for the benefit of an employee. W hether contributions are for the benefit of employees Payments employers are required to make under section 3111(a) of FICA are tax. Section 3111(a) imposes on every employer “an excise tax, with respect to having individuals in his employ”. An excise tax is “a tax upon an activity” (CCH Federal Tax Guide Reports paragraph 21,001); in this case a tax imposed in respect of employment (Helvering v Davis 57 SC 904). 8 However, a payment by an employer could be a contribution although the employer has a statutory obligation to make the payment. In Case M9 (1990) 12 NZTC 2069 it was held that the predecessor of section CX 13 applied to contributions made by a local authority to the National Provident Fund, although the employer did not have a choice about making the contributions. Judge Bathgate considered that the focus of the FBT legislation was whether the contributions could be regarded as a benefit from the employees’ point of view. Judge Bathgate said: The objector’s claim that the superannuation payments by the objector on behalf of its employees compulsorily paid by it under the National Provident Fund Act, are not benefits because it had no choice as to whether to make the payments is to an extent understandable, from the employer’s point of view. A benefit is often regarded as being given voluntarily, rather than compulsorily. A benefit may however be given under compulsion in some circumstances — Yates v Starkey \[1951\] 1 All ER 732. From the employees’ point of view, and after all Pt XB of the Income Tax Act is only concerned with benefits received by employees, albeit from employers, the contributions to the superannuation fund can be considered as a benefit. (p. 2073) In Yates v Starkey, referred to by Judge Bathgate, the Court of Appeal held that a person who had been ordered by the court to pay his wife an annual amount in trust for his children had provided funds for the purpose of the settlement of a trust. Jenkins LJ commented: I do not agree that the words “has provided” necessarily connote an exercise of free will. It seems to me that the taxpayer here if asked “Who is providing for the maintenance for your children?” could with perfect accuracy have replied “I am doing so under an order of the court”. (p. 479) However, for section CX 13 to apply the contribution must be for the benefit of an employee. In Case M9, although the employer was required by the National Provident Fund Act to make contributions, the objective of the contributions was to provide a benefit to employees under the National Provident Fund. In NZI Bank Ltd v Euro-National Corporation Ltd \[1992\] NZLR 528 Richardson J made the following comments in respect of the interpretation of the phrase “for the benefit of employees”: It is not sufficient to satisfy para (b) that the shares are to be held on trust for employees. The shares must be held “for the benefit” of employees. “For” in that context means with the object and purpose of benefiting employees and the “benefit” to employees must be discernible and real. As in the case of the exercise of trustees’ powers to make advances for a person’s benefit, it must confer an advantage which can be enjoyed by employees. It must be of value to employees. An arrangement does not qualify as being “for the benefit of employees” unless employees actually stand to benefit. (p. 544) Hence, for a contribution to be “for the benefit of an employee” in terms of section CX 13, the contribution must be made for the purpose of benefiting the employee and the contribution must provide something of real value to the employee. Employer contributions required under FICA are not held in trust for any employee. The US Social Security system for the payment of retirement benefits is a pay-as -you-go scheme under which current employer and employee contributions are used to fund the payment of retirement benefits to current recipients of retirement benefits. Neither employer nor employee contributions are allocated to, or held for, individual employees. Payments that an employer must make under FICA are not attributable to any particular employee. Excise tax is calculated on the total wages paid by the employer. Employees are not entitled to receive a refund of payments made either by employers or employees under FICA. The entitlement of employees to a retirement benefit does not depend on whether the employer has paid the excise tax imposed on the employer under FICA. To 9 qualify for a retirement benefit, a person must be a “fully insured individual” (42 USC, section 402(a)(1)). To be a “fully insured individual” a person must hold sufficient credits (that is, a minimum of 40 credits). The number of credits earned is based on the amount of the employees’ earnings over their working life and not on the payment of employer contributions. Payments made by employers under FICA also do not affect the amount of the benefit payable. The amount of the retirement benefit is based on average earnings over a person’s working life, indexed to account for changes in average wages. Employees cannot transfer or assign their right to any future benefit (42 USC, section 407). Flemming v Nestor 363 US 603 establishes that a person who makes payments under FICA does not as a consequence acquire a right to a benefit analogous to a property right. The Commissioner considers that payments of excise tax under FICA are not made by employers for the benefit of any particular employee as: •Employee contributions are not held in trust for any individual employee; •Employees are not entitled to receive any part of the contributions made by employers; •Employees do not obtain the right to a retirement benefit as a consequence of the payments made by employers; an d •T he payment of employer contributions by employers does not affect the amount of the benefit payable to employees. T herefore, such payments do not give rise to a fringe benefit in terms of section CX 13. Contributions to sickness, accident or death benefit fund: section CX 14 Under section CX 14 a fringe benefit arises when an employer makes a contribution for the benefit of an employee to a sickness, an accident or a death benefit fund. The definition of “sickness, accident, or death benefit fund” in section YA 1 refers to a sickness, an accident, or a death fund that is: •Established for the benefit of employees, the members of an incorporated society, o r th e surviving spouses and dependants of those employees; and •Approved by the Commissioner. Under the US social security legislation separate funds are established for the payment of disability benefits and Medicare (the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund and the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund). Self-employed people can also earn credits so that they are entitled to receive disability benefits or Medicare. The funds are not limited to the employees of a particular employer or to employees in general. They were established to fund the payment of government-provided disability benefits and hospital and medical benefits that are available to all people who earn sufficient credits to qualify for benefits and satisfy the other conditions set out in the US legislation. Payments by employers do not directly affect employees’ entitlement to disability benefits or Medicare. Whether the employer pays employer contributions does not affect the employees’ entitlement to disability benefits or Medicare or the amount of the benefit. The Commissioner considers that neither the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund nor the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund was established for the benefit of employees. The 10 funds were not established for the benefit of a particular employer’s employees and were not established for the benefit of employees alone. Employees do not obtain a right to receive Medicare or disability benefits as a consequence of the payments made by their employer. To be a sickness, an accident or a death fund within the statutory definition, a fund must also be approved by the Commissioner. As the Commissioner has not approved either the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund or the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the funds cannot be sickness, accident or death benefit funds for the purpose of section CX 14. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that a benefit does not arise in terms of section CX 14 as a consequence of payments required to be made by employers in respect of the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund or the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund under FICA as these funds are not sickness, accident or death funds as defined in section YA 1. Unclassified benefit: section CX 37 The definition of “unclassified benefit” in section CX 37 refers to a benefit an employer provides to an employee “in connection with their employment” other than the benefits referred to in any of sections CX 6 to CX 16. “ Benefit” is not defined for FBT purposes. Therefore, the ordinary meaning of “benefit” applies. In CIR v Dick (2001) 20 NZTC 17,396 Glazebrook J commented as follows on the meaning of “benefit”: \[48\]The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary (1993 ed) defines benefit (in relevant part) as: a favour, gift, a benefaction, an advantage, a good, pecuniary profit. Likewise the definition of advantage is: a favouring circumstance, something which gives one a better position, benefit. Looking at the dictionary meaning of those words it would appear that something may not be a benefit or advantage if it has been acquired through the provision of services or goods at market value. This, therefore, is i n contrast to the definition of income. T he Commissioner considers that in the FBT context a “benefit” is an advantage, a material acquisition that confers an economic benefit on an employee. As outlined in “QB0043 The meaning of ‘benefit’ for FBT purposes” (published in Taxation Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 2 (March 2006)), in considering whether a benefit has been provided to an employee it is not relevant that the employee made a payment for what is provided. For there to be a “fringe benefit”, the benefit must be provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment. The meaning of the phrase “in connection with” was considered in Claremont Petroleum NL v Cummings (1992) 110 ALR 239. Wilcox J said: The phrase “in connection” is one of wide import, as I had occasion to observe in a different context in Our Town FM Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1987) 16 FCR 465 at 479-80; 77 ALR 577 at 591-592: The words “in connection with”.... do not necessarily require a causal relationship between two things: see Commissioner for Superannuation v Miller (1985) FCR 153 at 154, 160, 163; 63 ALR 237 at 238, 244, 247. They may be used to describe a relationship with a contemplated future event, see Koppen v Commissioner for Community Relations (1986) 11 FCR 360 at 364; 67 ALR 215; Johnson v Johnson \[1952\] P47 at 50-1. In the latter case the United Kingdom Court of Appeal applied a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, Re Nanaimo Community Hotel Ltd \[1945\] 3 DLR 225, in which the question was whether a particular court, which was given “jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions that may arise in connection with any assessment made under this Act”, had jurisdiction to deal with a matter which preceded the issue of an assessment. The trial judge held that it did, that 11 the phrase “in connection with” covered matters leading up to, or which might lead up to an assessment. He said: “One of the very generally accepted meanings of ‘connection’ is ‘relation between things one of which is bound up with or involved in another’, or again ‘having to do with’. The words include matters occurring prior to as well as subsequent to or consequent upon so long as they are related to the principal thing. The phrase ‘having to do with’ perhaps gives as good a suggestion of the meaning as could be had.” This statement was upheld on appeal. (p 280) Ha rdie Boys J made the following comments on the meaning of “in connection with” in Strachan v Marriott \[1995\] 3 NZLR 272: “In connection with” may signify no more than a relationship between one thing and another. The expression does not necessarily require that it be a causal relationship: Our Town FM Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1987) 16 FCR 465, 479 per Wilcox J. But, as Davies J warned in Hatfield v Health Insurance Commission (1987) 15 FCR 487, at p 491: Expressions such as ‘relating to’, ‘in relation to’, ‘in connection with’ and ‘in respect of’ are commonly found in legislation but invariably raise problems of statutory interpretation. They are terms which fluctuate in operation from statute to statute . ... The terms may have a very wide operation but they do not usually carry the widest possible ambit, for they are subject to the context in which they are used, to the words with which they are associated, and to the object or purpose of the statutory provision in which they appear. (pp. 279-281) In The Queen v Savage \[1983\] CTC 393 Dickson J in the Supreme Court of Canada commented: 23 ....Our Act contains the stipulation, not found in the English statutes referred to, “benefits of any kind whatever ... in respect of, in the course of, or by virtue of an office or employment”. ... Further, our Act speaks of a benefit “in respect of” an office or employment. In Nowegijick v The Queen, \[1983\] C.T.C. 20, 83 D.T.C. 5041 this Court said, at 25 \[5045\], that: The words “in respect of” are, in my opinion, words of the widest possible scope. They import such meanings as “in relation to”, “with reference to” or “in connection with”. The phrase “in respect of” probably the widest of any expression intended to convey some connection between two related subject matters. See also Paterson v. Chadwick, \[1974\] 2 All ER 772 (QBD) at 775. \[Emphasis added\] T herefore, the phrase “in connection with” is used to describe a relationship between two things, but not necessarily a causal relationship. The phrases “in connection with”, “in relation to” and “in respect of” have similar meanings. These expressions are capable of having a very wide meaning. The degree of the relationship required depends on the context in which the expression is used. In the Australian FBT context, the courts have considered that it cannot be said that any causal relationship between the benefit and the employment is a sufficient relationship for FBT purposes and that a sufficient or material rather than a causal connection or relationship between the benefit and the employment must be established: see J & G Knowles & Associates Pty Ltd v FCT 2000 ATC 4151. In that case, the court considered that it was helpful to consider whether the benefit is a product or incident of the employment. The Commissioner considers that this approach would also be appropriate in the New Zealand context, given that FBT was intended to apply to non-cash remuneration provided to employees. The Commissioner considers that where the employment is a substantial reason for the provision of the benefit, there would be a sufficient relationship between the benefit and 12 the employment (see “QB0043 The meaning of ‘benefit’ for FBT purposes” (published in Taxation Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 2 (March 2006))). Employer contributions The Commissioner considers that employer contributions do not give rise to a benefit that is provided by the employer in connection with the employment of any employee. It is not possible to establish a link between a benefit arising from the payment of employer contributions and any particular employee. The reasons are as follows: •Employees do not obtain a benefit in the form of an entitlement to receive payments made by employers under FICA. Employees have no beneficial entitlement to amounts paid by them or by their employer under FICA. •An employee’s right to receive a social security benefit is conditional on the employee satisfying the eligibility requirements in the social security legislation. When the right to receive payment from a fund is conditional, a benefit would not be provided when payment is made to the fund (Constable v Commissioner of Taxation 5 ATD 83). In Constable the taxpayer was the member of a provident fund established for the employees of the Shell group of companies. Both employer and employee contributions were paid to the fund. The fund’s regulations permitted members to withdraw the amount held on their behalf if an amendment was made to the regulations that curtailed their rights. Such an amendment was made with effect from 30 September 1947. The taxpayer withdrew amounts held to his cred it ( including the employer’s contributions and interest earned on the amount contributed). The High Court of Australia held that these amounts did not constitute an allowance, a gratuity, compensation, a benefit, a bonus or a premium in respect of or for or in relation to the taxpayer’s employment or services rendered by him. Dixon CJ and McTiernan, Williams and Fullager JJ in their joint judgment commented: It appears to us that the taxpayer becomes entitled to a payment out of the fund by reason of a contingency (viz an alteration of the regulations curtailing the rights of members) which occurred in the year enabling him to call for the amounts shown by his account. It was a contingent right which became absolute. The happening of the event which made it absolute did not, and could not amount to an allowing, giving or granting to him of any allowance, gratuity, compensation, benefit, bonus or premium . T he fund existed as one to a share in which he had a contractual, if not a proprietary title. All tha t o ccurred in the year of income with respect to the sums in question was that the future and contingent or conditional right became \[a\] right to present payment and payment was made accordingly . .... It is not of course, a matter which arises for decisi on in the present case, but to avoid misunderstanding it is we think desirable to say that on the frame of the regulations we find it by no means easy to see how the sums so contributed can be regarded as allowed, granted or given to the employee when they are paid to the Administrators of the Fund. It is only after the Administrators have exercised their discretion that the moneys paid to the special account are reflected in the member’s (employee’s) account and even then that does not mean that the member becomes presently entitled to the moneys credited to that account. (pp. 95-96) •A benefit (either in the form of a social security benefit or the right to receive a social security benefit) would not be provided when payments are made by the employer under FICA. Employees must satisfy the statutory criteria (including citizenship or residence requirements, reaching retirement age, disability, earning the minimu m n umber of credits) before a benefit would be paid to the employees. Fleming v Nestor 363 US 603 confirms that a right to receive future benefits does not accrue as a consequence of payments made by the employer under FICA. •The substantial reason for payment or the provision of retirement, disability or M edicare benefits to an employee is that the employee satisfies the statutory criteria 13 for eligibility to receive the benefit. The amount of any benefit paid is not related to the payments made under FICA. The amount depends on a person’s earnings history (whether as an employee or a self-employed person). Therefore, there is an insufficient relationship between the payment of a social security benefit and payments made by the employer under FICA. E mployee contributions T he Commissioner considers that the deduction of employee contributions from wages and the payment of such contributions under FICA also do not give rise to a benefit in connection with the employee’s employment. As employee contributions form part of the salary or wages paid to employees, employee contributions are assessable income of employees in terms of section CE 1(a). That being the case, such contributions are specifically excluded from the definition of “fringe benefit” by section CX 4. In Case 207 CTBR(NS) 91 it was accepted that deductions made under FICA from the salary paid to an Australian resident who was a visiting professor at a university in the US\_ was assessable income of the taxpayer. The issue was whether the amount deducted under FI CA was exempt income (on the basis that a liability for income tax in the US had been paid). S ummary For there to be an FBT liability, the employer must have provided a “fringe benefit” to an employee. •E mployer contributions paid under FICA do not give rise to a “fringe benefit” under section CX 13 as the contributions are not made for the benefit of employees. •E mployer contributions paid under FICA do not give rise to a “fringe benefit” under section CX 14. As trust funds established for the purpose of paying disability benefits or Medicare and funded by payments under FICA were not established for the benefi t o f employees and have not been approved by the Commissioner, the funds are no t “ sickness, accident or death benefit funds” as defined in section YA 1. •E mployer contributions under FICA do not give rise to an “unclassified benefit” in terms of section CX 37 as a benefit is not provided by employers in connection with the employment of employees through the payment of employer contributions under FICA. •E mployee contributions do not give rise to an “unclassified benefit”. Employee contributions required to be deducted from wages and paid under FICA represent par t of employees’ assessable income and are expressly excluded from the definition of “fringe benefit” by section CX 4. T herefore, payments required under FICA are not subject to FBT.
1 UNCLASSIFIED PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 19/03 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by StockCo Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BG 1, DA 1(1), DA 2, EA 3, EJ 10, FA 6 to FA 11, FA 12, GA 1 and subpart EW. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement The Arrangement is the leasing of livestock by StockCo Limited (StockCo) to its customers (Customers) to use in a farming business. Each Customer will be a “New Zealand resident” (as defined in s YA 1). The leased livestock will either be purchased by StockCo from the Customer and will then be leased back to them, or will be specifically purchased by StockCo from a third party and then leased to the Customer. The Customer will lease the livestock over a period of usually four years. The livestock will be progressively culled (or will otherwise go missing or die) over the period of the Lease, with cull payments being returned to StockCo. Further details of the Arrangement are set out below. The Purchase of Livestock 1.StockCo will purchase an agreed number of “specified livestock” (as defined in s YA 1), in this case cows, from the Customer, or a third party, for the purchase price (Purchase Price): WE WILL PURCHASE THE HERD 4 We will purchase the Cows specified in each Lease Agreement for the Purchase Price detailed in the Lease Agreement on the Commencement Date. 5 When we purchase Cows from you we will create a buyer generated invoice. 6 We are purchasing the Cows at your request. You are responsible for inspecting and approving all Cows prior to us purchasing them. ... WITHDRAWN - see ruling BR Prd 20/03 2 UNCLASSIFIED 2.The Purchase Price is the equivalent of the market value of the purchased cows at the time of acquisition. 3.Where the livestock are purchased from a third party, the Purchase Price will be paid by StockCo to the third party vendor. 4.The Customer will apply the Purchase Price to debt or other farming costs (such as expanding their farming operations or covering other business related costs). The Lease 5.The Agreement entered into between StockCo and its customers comprises of two documents: the Dairy Herd Lease Master Terms (Master Terms) and the Lease Agreement (Lease Agreement) (together, the Lease). The Lease sets out the terms of the sale (where StockCo purchases livestock from the Customer) and the lease of the livestock. 6.The terms of the Lease Agreement and the Master Terms will not be materially different from the version provided to Inland Revenue on 25 October 2019. 7.As provided for in clause 7 of the Master Terms, StockCo owns the cows and leases the purchased cows to the Customer for the lease period, while the Customer owns all milk and progeny produced by the leased cows: 7 We will own the Cows. You will own all progeny and milk produced by the Cows during the Lease period. WE WILL LEASE YOU THE HERD 8 We lease to you, and you take on lease, the Herd for the term specified in the Lease Agreement from the time we purchase the Herd. 8.The progeny will be valued in accordance with the livestock valuation rules set out in Part EC of the Act. 9.Clauses 11 to 13 of the Master Terms set out the payment obligations of the Customer: YOUR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS 11 You will pay us for each Herd: 11.1 Lease Payments: the Lease Payments as set out in the relevant Lease Agreement. The Lease Payments are the rent payable for the lease of the Herd. 11.2 Cull Payments: the Cull Payments as set out in the relevant Lease Agreement. (a )T he Cull Payments are the amounts we agree to realise from Cull Cows when they are culled. You agree to realise this amount for us by selling the Cull Cows on our behalf. WITHDRAWN 3 UNCLASSIFIED (b)You will pay us the Cull Payments regardless of the amount you realise from selling the Cull Cows on our behalf. If you realise more than the Cull Payments you may keep the additional amount. 12 On the Commencement Date (or as otherwise specified) you will also pay us any establishment fee or other fee specified in a Lease Agreement. 13 You will provide us with a signed Dairy Order so that the Lease Payments are paid directly to us by the Dairy Company. 10.Under clause 13 the Customer must arrange for the Lease Payments to be made directly to StockCo by the Dairy Company (defined in clause 59 of the Maste r T erms as “Fonterra”). Accordingly, only Fonterra members are eligible to enter into the Agreement. 11.The Customer will use the livestock valuation regime in subpart EC of the Act to determine the value of the leased livestock. Early Termination of the Lease and Events of Default 12.Clause 21 of the Master Terms provides for the early termination of the Lease by the customer in certain situations: EARLY TERMINATION 21 Where there is a material change in your circumstances, you may terminate the Lease early by: 21.1 purchasing the remainder of the Herd for the Net Present Value of the unpaid Lease Payments and Cull Payments; and 21.2 paying us any other amount owing to us under this agreement in relation to the relevant Lease; or 13.It is expected that this clause would be applied only in rare cases as a cost/benefit a nalysis would normally favour the Customer remaining in the lease and continuing to meet the Lease obligations. 14.Clause 22 of the Master Terms provides for early termination by StockCo: 22 We can end the Lease under clause 25.2 because of your default. 15.Clause 25.2 of the Master Terms states: 25 If an Event of Default has occurred, we may: ... 25.2 end the Lease with effect from any date specified by us and require you to, at our option: (a )r eturn the Herd to us at the location and by the date nominated by us. If we end the Lease under this clause 25.2(a) you will pay us liquidated damages equal to the amount (if any) by which the marke t v alue of the Herd (as determined by us, acting reasonably) is les s WITHDRAWN 4 UNCLASSIFIED than the Net Present Value of the unpaid Lease Payments and Cull Payments; or (b)purchase the Herd for the sum of the Net Present Value of the unpaid Lease Payments and Cull Payments. 16.Clause 25.1 allows for StockCo to repossess the Herd or any Cows following an Event of Default: 25.1 enter the Land (or any land where we consider the Herd or any Cows may be) without notice and repossess any or all of the Cows; ... 17.This Ruling does not consider or rule on Early Termination or Events of Default that occur as part of the Arrangement. Return of the leased cows 18.The leased cows are returned to StockCo by way of an agreed culling process over the term of the lease. In this respect clauses 9 and 10 of the Master Terms state: YOU WILL CULL THE COWS ON OUR BEHALF 9 We recognise that the Herd will progressively reach the end of its useful milking life over the Lease period. 10 You agree to reduce the Herd to zero over the Lease period at the approximate Annual Cull Rate specified in the relevant Lease Agreement. The Annual Cull Amount Due has been determined on the basis of the Annual Cull Rate and Cull Value specified in the relevant Lease Agreement. 19.Despite clause 10, it is acknowledged in the Lease that cows may die or go missing. Clauses 15 and 16 of the Lease set out terms relating to missing and dead cows: MISSING AND DEAD COWS 15 We understand that deaths occur and that Cows may go missing. We have included an annual death and missing cow allowance of 2.5% of the Herd within the Lease Payment calculation. 16 You agree that the Cows are at your sole risk. You must pay the Lease Payments and Cull Payments regardless of anything else, including the reason for, or the number of, deaths or missing cows. 20.A dairy herd generally loses approximately 25% of its mature cows annually through culling of the older cows and natural attrition. Therefore, it is expected that none of the leased livestock will remain at the end of the Lease period. Deferred Cull Payment 21.The amount and timing of the Cull Payments are agreed at the time of entering into the Lease and is reflected in the Payment Schedule. As the amounts payable are fixed the Customer takes on the risk of under-recovery from the meat works on the culled cows but gets the benefit of any over-recovery. WITHDRAWN 5 UNCLASSIFIED 22. The frequency and timing of the Cull Payments are negotiated between the Customer and StockCo, but payment will generally be either at the time the livestock are culled, or deferred until the end of the Lease term and paid as a lump sum. 23. As legal ownership of the Cull Payments remains with StockCo, it will return the Cull Payments as income in the year in which those payments are derived. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) The lease payments are deductible under s DA 1(1) and none of the general limitations in s DA 2 applies to prevent deductibility, provided that: • no provision in subparts DB to DZ applies to prevent a deduction under s DA (1). b) At the end of an income year, unless excused from this requirement pursuant to a determination issued by the Commissioner, s EA 3 applies to require the unexpired portion of any lease payments to be included in the Customer’s income in the current income year and to be an amount for which the Customer is allowed a deduction in the following income year, provided that the Lease is not “revenue account property” or “trading stock” (within the meaning of s YA 1) of the Customer. c) The financial arrangements rules in subpart EW do not apply to the Arrangement as the lease is an excepted financial arrangement. d) Section EJ 10 does not apply to the Arrangement. e) Sections FA 6 to FA 11 do not apply to the Arrangement because the lease is not a finance lease. f) Section FA 12 does not apply to the Arrangement because the lease is not a hire purchase agreement. g) Sections BG 1 and GA 1 do not apply to negate or vary the above conclusions. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on the date this R uling is signed and ending on 31 December 2023. This Ruling is signed by me on the 19 th day of December 2019. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings) WITHDRAWN

The Rulings consider two situations. The situations represent two points in time at which s CB 4 could apply when share rights are altered, namely when the: • rights are altered; and • shares with altered rights are disposed of. 2. Whether s CB 4 applies in these situations depends on whether the shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration. 3. A basis sometimes put forward for shares with fundamentally altered rights being different property is the contractual doctrine of rescission. In the case of alterations provided for in the terms on which the shares were issued, the alteration would be pursuant to the original contract, so the contractual doctrine of rescission would not apply. For the contractual doctrine of rescission to be relevant in other cases, there must be a contract. This makes the nature of a share, and whether share rights are conferred by contract, relevant in determining whether shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration. It is also relevant to consider the rules in the Companies Act 1993 (CA 1993) for the issue and cancellation of shares and the altering of share rights. 2 UNCLASSIFIED 4. The Commissioner considers that shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration for the purposes of s CB 4 for four reasons: • The rights and obligations comprising a share are not conferred by contract, so the contractual doctrine of rescission is not relevant. • Based on the rules in the CA 1993 for the issue and cancellation of shares and the altering of share rights, there is no cancellation and issue of shares by implication when share rights alter. • When share rights alter, at no point does a shareholder lose control of their shares and have only a right to receive shares, such as may be the case when shares are cancelled and new shares are issued. • Altering share rights does not involve property moving from the company to the shareholders. The alteration merely alters the shareholders’ existing rights against the company. 5. Accordingly, the alteration of rights attached to shares (share rights) does not result in a disposal of any shares for the purposes of s CB 4. The shares continue in existence with altered rights. The Commissioner considers that this will be the case whether there is a minor change, or a complete change of class. 6. When a shareholder who acquired the shares on revenue account before the alteration disposes of the shares after the alteration, s CB 4 will apply to the disposal. This is because the shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration. Therefore, the time of acquisition of the shares with altered rights is the time the shares were acquired before the alteration. 7. While an alteration of share rights will not result in a disposal of a share, it may have an effect on shareholder continuity. 8. If a change in the rights attached to a share is effected by cancelling the old share and issuing a new share, there will be a disposal for the purposes of s CB 4 when the share is cancelled. Background 9. BR Pub 19/05 and BR Pub 19/06 are reissues of BR Pub 17/04 and BR Pub 17/05, respectively. There are no changes to the Commissioner’s view of the application of s CB 4 to the Arrangement. Application of the legislation 10. Under s CB 4, an amount that a person derives from disposing of personal property is income of the person if they acquired the property for the purpose of disposing of it: CB 4 Personal property acquired for purpose of disposal An amount that a person derives from disposing of personal property is income of the person if they acquired the property for the purpose of disposing of it. 11. Shares are a type of personal property: s 35 of the CA 1993. 3 UNCLASSIFIED 12. Shares confer rights on shareholders: s 36(1) of the CA 1993. The rights can be altered by the constitution of the company, if any, or the terms on which the shares were issued: s 36(2) of the CA 1993. Altering share rights may be referred to as alterations, share reclassifications or share reorganisations. 13. Questions arise as to the application of s CB 4 where share rights alter and when a shareholder disposes of shares with altered rights. The Rulings consider two points in time at which s CB 4 could apply when share rights are altered, namely when the: • rights are altered; • shares with altered rights are disposed of. 14. Whether s CB 4 applies in these situations depends on whether the shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration. Can the shares with altered rights be regarded as the same property as the shares before the alteration? 15. Two broad requirements of s CB 4 must be satisfied. If these requirements are met, an amount that the person derives from disposing of the personal property is income of the person. The first requirement is that a person acquires personal property for the purpose of disposing of it. The second requirement is that the person disposes of the personal property. 16. The grammatical construction of s CB 4 shows that the property disposed of must be the same property as that acquired. When share rights alter, the question arises whether the shares are the same property as the shares before the alteration. The answer to this question will also assist in determining the time of acquisition of the shares with altered rights for the purposes of s CB 4. In determining whether the shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration, it is helpful to ask two questions: • What is the nature of a share? • Are shares disposed of when rights attached to them alter? What is the nature of a share? 17. Section 36(1) of the CA 1993 sets out the basic rights and powers that attach to shares. The basic rights and powers include the right for the shareholder to vote at a meeting of the company on any resolution, the right to an equal share in dividends authorised by the board, and the right to an equal share in the distribution of surplus assets of the company. The rights may be negated, altered or added to by the constitution of the company, if there is one, or under the terms on which the shares were issued: s 36(2) of the CA 1993. 18. A company may issue different classes of shares: s 37(2) of the CA 1993. “Class” means a class of shares having identical rights, privileges, limitations and conditions attached to them: s 116(1) of the CA 1993. 19. It is generally accepted that a share is a bundle of rights and obligations between the shareholders and the company: Borland’s Trustee v Steel Brothers & Co Ltd 4 UNCLASSIFIED \[1901\] 1 Ch 279; Bradbury v English Sewing Cotton Ltd \[1923\] AC 744 (HL); IRC v Laird Group plc \[2003\] UKHL 54. This was confirmed by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Robertson v Bicknell \[2002\] BCL 408 (CA). In Robertson at \[23\], the Court also confirmed that the nature of the property in a share is the interest of a person in the company, that interest comprising various rights and obligations. 20. A shareholder does not have a proprietary right or interest in the assets of a company. A shareholder has been said to be entitled to a proportion of the company’s share capital, with reference to which the shareholder has certain rights: Archibald Howie v Commr of Stamp Duties (NSW) (1948) 77 CLR 143 at 156. 21. The property comprising a share encompasses all of the rights and obligations attached to the share. A shareholder does not own each share right as a separate piece of property: In re Alex Russell (deceased) \[1968\] VR 285 at 299. 22. Previously, under the Companies Act 1955 (CA 1955), the memorandum and articles of a company were deemed to be a contract between the company and its shareholders: s 34 of the CA 1955. However, the CA 1993 replaced the contractual model in the CA 1955: Maori Development Corp Ltd v Power Beat International Ltd \[1995\] 2 NZLR 568 (HC). The relationship between a company and its shareholders is now statutory: ss 31 and 38 of the CA 1993. 23. Obiter dicta in some cases decided under the CA 1993 suggest the relationship between a company and its shareholders remains a contractual one: Ord v Calan Healthcare Properties Ltd \[2004\] 2 NZLR 122 (HC); Todd Petroleum Mining Co Ltd v Shell (Petroleum Mining) Co Ltd (2005) 2 NZCCLR 266 (HC); Herzog v Hertli (HC Blenheim CIV-2007-406-251, 23 March 2009); Manak v Hutt & City Taxis Ltd \[2009\] NZCCLR 36 (HC). However, in Maori Development Corp, s 31 of the CA 1993 was specifically referred to and considered. Blanchard J said, at 574, that the contractual model in the CA 1955 had been replaced by the statutory statement in s 31 of the CA 1993. 24. Blanchard J’s view is supported by statements made by the New Zealand Law Commission on the form and content of a new Companies Act in Company Law Reform and Restatement (NZLC R9, New Zealand Law Commission, Wellington, June 1989). In that report, at 1, the Commission said that one of the most significant proposed reforms was to redefine “the distribution of power within the company by direct operation of statute rather than by a deemed contract”. The Commission said, at 19, that “\[t\]he standard constitution, and any modification of it, should confer rights directly and not, as the \[CA 1955\] provides, by deeming the constitutional documents to be a contract”. Also, the Explanatory Note to the Companies Bill introduced on 21 September 1990 stated, at ii, that a purpose of the Bill was to redefine “the distribution of power within the company by direct operation of statute rather than by a deemed contract”. 25. The change from the contractual model of the CA 1955 is important. This is because under the contractual model, fundamentally altering the share rights may have amounted to rescission of a contract and the entering into of a new one and, by implication, a cancellation of the shares and the issue of new ones. This would not have been the case, though, if the alteration arose from the terms of the shares themselves or the articles of association of the company (or constitution in the case of the CA 1993). However, given the statutory basis of shares under the CA 1993, the contractual doctrine of rescission is not relevant. Whether the shares are 5 UNCLASSIFIED cancelled and new ones are issued depends on the operation of the CA 1993 and the company’s constitution, if any. 26. The Commissioner considers that the relationship between a company and its shareholders is statutory. The Commissioner has previously considered the nature of shares: “Public Rulings BR Pub 16/05: Income tax – Treatment of a subdivision of shares under section CB 4 and BR Pub 16/06: Income tax – Treatment of a disposal of subdivided shares under s CB 4”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 5 (June 2016): 3-5. The Commentary on BR Pub 16/05 and BR Pub 16/06 states that it is generally accepted that a share is a bundle of rights and obligations conferred under a contract between the shareholders and the company. To the extent that the Commentary on BR Pub 16/05 and BR Pub 16/06 suggests the relationship between a company and its shareholders is contractual, it is incorrect. The Commentary to these Public Rulings (BR Pub 19/05 and BR Pub 19/06) should be relied on as setting out the Commissioner’s view on the nature of a share and the relationship between a company and its shareholders. Are shares disposed of when the rights attached to them alter? 27. “Dispose” is not defined in s YA 1 for the purposes of s CB 4 (it is defined for the purposes of other sections in the Act, but these definitions do not assist in this inquiry). The courts have held that, speaking generally, “disposed of” covers all forms of alienation and carries connotations of sale, assignment, or transfer of the property: FCT v Wade (1951) 84 CLR 105; Lyttelton Port Co Ltd v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,556 (HC). “Disposition” has been said to mean “a ridding oneself of the right or interest”: Coles Myer Ltd v Commr of State Revenue (Vic) 98 ATC 4537 (VSCA) at 4,546. As a result, the Commissioner considers that “disposing” of property must involve the alienation or ridding of that property by the disposer. 28. If there is a cancellation and issue of shares by implication when share rights alter, then that would indicate that shares have been disposed of and that the shares with altered rights are different property from the shares before the alteration. 29. The CA 1993 provides comprehensive rules for the issue and cancellation of shares, and the altering of share rights. 30. Section 36(2) of the CA 1993 provides that the rights and powers attached to shares may be negated, altered or added to by the constitution of the company or in accordance with the terms on which the shares were issued. A company is not required to have a constitution, although it may adopt one by special resolution: ss 26 and 32 of the CA 1993. If a company does not have a constitution, the company, its board and each of its directors and shareholders have the rights, powers, duties and obligations set out in the CA 1993: s 28 of the CA 1993. If a company does not have a constitution, the rights attached to its shares can be altered only in accordance with the terms on which the shares were issued. 31. Sections 117 and 118 of the CA 1993 provide certain rules regarding the alteration of shareholder rights. Section 117(1) of the CA 1993 provides that a company must not take action that affects share rights unless that action has been approved by shareholders whose rights are affected. Section 118 of the CA 1993 gives dissenting shareholders the right to require the company to purchase their shares. 6 UNCLASSIFIED 32. The issue of shares is dealt with in ss 41–51 of the CA 1993. The issue of shares has been described as the whole process whereby unissued shares are applied for, allotted and, finally, registered: National Westminster Bank plc v IRC \[1994\] 3 All ER 1 (HL). Section 42 of the CA 1993 provides that, subject to the CA 1993 and the constitution of the company, if any, a company may issue shares at any time, to any person and in any number it thinks fit. On the face of it, this is a very broad power. However, the right to issue shares is subject to requirements in other provisions of the CA 1993, such as the registration of notice of a share issue and the obtaining of shareholder approval in certain circumstances: ss 43 and 44 of the CA 1993. Section 107(2) of the CA 1993 provides that shares may be issued otherwise than in accordance with some of these requirements, if all entitled persons agree or concur. Section 51 provides that a share is issued when the name of the holder is entered on the share register. 33. Sections 58–67 of the CA 1993 deal with the acquisition by a company of its own shares and their deemed cancellation. Section 59 provides that a company may acquire its own shares if permitted by its constitution, if any. Generally, any shares so acquired are deemed to be cancelled immediately on acquisition: s 66 of the CA 1993. A company must comply with procedural requirements when acquiring its own shares, such as meeting a solvency test and registration of a notice of the acquisition: ss 58 and 59 of the CA 1993. 34. Sections 68–75 of the CA 1993 deal with the redemption of shares and their deemed cancellation. Section 68 provides that shares are redeemable if: • the constitution of the company makes provision for the issue of redeemable shares, and • the constitution or the terms of issue of the shares makes provision for the redemption of the shares for a consideration that is specified or calculated by a formula or suitably qualified person. 35. Shares that a company redeems are deemed to be cancelled immediately on redemption: s 73 of the CA 1993. A company must comply with procedural requirements when redeeming shares, such as board resolutions and meeting a solvency test in certain circumstances: ss 69 and 70 of the CA 1993. 36. The separate rules in the CA 1993 for the issue and cancellation of shares, and the altering of share rights, make it seem unlikely that an alteration of share rights by the company’s constitution, if any, or the terms on which the shares are issued will involve the cancellation and issue of shares by implication. 37. Further, s 83 of the CA 1993 provides for a statement of rights to be given to shareholders, on request. Section 83(2) provides that the company does not have to provide a shareholder with such a statement in certain circumstances, including if a statement has been provided within the previous six months and: • the shareholder has not acquired or disposed of shares since the previous statement was provided (s 83(2)(b) of the CA 1993); and • the rights attached to shares of the company have not been altered since the previous statement was provided (s 83(2)(c) of the CA 1993). 38. The relevance of s 83(2) of the CA 1993 is the distinction that Parliament has drawn between the acquisition of shares and the alteration of share rights. It is 7 UNCLASSIFIED apparent from s 83(2) of the CA 1993 that Parliament regarded the acquisition of shares and the alteration to share rights as different things. 39. Based on the rules in the CA 1993 for the issue and cancellation of shares and the altering of share rights, the Commissioner considers that there is no cancellation and issue of shares by implication when share rights alter. This will be the case whether there is a minor change, or a complete change of class. 40. There are other indications that shares are not disposed of when share rights alter. One such indication is that when share rights alter there is no point at which a shareholder loses control of their shares and has only a right to receive shares, such as may be the case when shares are cancelled and new shares are issued. 41. Another is that altering share rights does not involve property moving from the company to the shareholders. The alteration merely alters the shareholders’ existing rights against the company: Robertson v FCT (1952) 86 CLR 463. Conclusion 42. The Commissioner considers that shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration for the purposes of s CB 4 for four reasons: • The rights and obligations comprising a share are not conferred by contract, so the contractual doctrine of rescission is not relevant. • Based on the separate rules in the CA 1993 for the issue and cancellation of shares and the altering of share rights, there is no cancellation and issue of shares by implication when share rights alter. • When share rights alter there is no point at which a shareholder loses control of their shares and has only a right to receive shares, such as may be the case when shares are cancelled and new shares are issued. • Altering share rights does not involve property moving from the company to the shareholders. The alteration merely alters the shareholders’ existing rights against the company. 43. This conclusion is consistent with Interpretation Statement “Available subscribed capital – Consequences of deemed reregistration”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 10, No 7 (July 1998): 8, which considers the consequences of share reclassifications on available subscribed capital. 44. While the altered shares will be the same property, it is noted that any change to the “voting rights” (defined in s YC 2) attached to shares may affect shareholder continuity for the purposes of determining whether losses and imputation credits can be carried forward. It is also noted that s GB 34 (ICA arrangements for carrying amounts forward) may apply in some circumstances if voting rights are altered. Does s CB 4 apply at the time share rights are altered? 45. When share rights alter, the Commissioner considers that the shareholder does not alienate, rid themselves of, or otherwise lose control of their shares. Shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration. Given 8 UNCLASSIFIED this, the Commissioner considers s CB 4 does not apply at the time share rights are altered. Does s CB 4 apply at the time shares with altered rights are disposed of? 46. An amount derived by a person on the disposal of shares with altered rights, where the shares were acquired before the alteration for the purpose of disposal, will be income of the person under s CB 4. Conversely, s CB 4 will not apply to an amount derived by a person on the disposal of the shares where the shares were not acquired before the alteration for the purpose of disposal. This is because the shares held by the person after the rights attached to the shares have been altered are the same property as the shares held by the person before the alteration. What is the time of acquisition for shares with altered rights held on revenue account? 47. Given that the shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration, the Commissioner considers that the time of acquisition of the shares with altered rights is the time the shares were acquired before the alteration. Examples 48. The following examples are included to help explain the application of the law. Example 1 — shares acquired for the purpose of disposal 49. On 15 May 2018, Shani purchased 1,000 shares in Red Packaging Ltd (RPL) for $10 per share. Shani acquired the shares for the purpose of disposing of them. Therefore, Shani holds these shares on revenue account. 50. The directors of RPL decide to create a new class of share with preferential rights to dividends and limited voting rights. The rights attached to half of RPL’s issued shares will be altered to create the new class of share. Five hundred of Shani’s shares will have their rights altered and become part of the new class of shares. The alteration has been approved by interested shareholders. 51. The alteration occurs on 30 July 2019. Shani’s shares are not formally cancelled or redeemed; nor are any new shares issued. Section CB 4 will not apply at this time because Shani has not disposed of anything. 52. On 15 August 2019, Shani sells all of her shares in RPL for $15,000. At this point, the requirements of s CB 4 have been met. Shani has derived an amount from the disposal of property that she acquired for the purpose of disposal. As a result, Shani will have derived income of $15,000 on the sale of the shares. She will be allowed a deduction of $10,000 under s DB 23 for the cost of the shares in RPL, this being the amount she incurred when the shares were acquired on 15 May 2019. 9 UNCLASSIFIED Example 2 — shares not acquired for purpose of disposal 53. On 10 April 2018, Blue Ltd purchased 100 shares in Orange Transport Ltd (OTL) as a long-term investment. The shares carry preferential rights to dividends and have limited voting rights. The directors of OTL proposed that the rights attached to the shares be altered on 1 June 2019 so as to attract ordinary rights to dividends and full voting rights. Blue Ltd is among the majority of shareholders who vote in favour of the alteration. The shares are not formally cancelled or redeemed; nor are any new shares issued. Section CB 4 will not apply on 1 June 2019 when the share rights alter because Blue Ltd has not disposed of anything. 54. On 1 October 2019, due to a change in investment strategy, Blue Ltd decides to sell its shares in OTL. Section CB 4 will not apply to the amount that Blue Ltd derives on the disposal of its shares in OTL. This is because, even though Blue Ltd voted in favour of the alteration to share rights, the shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration. When Blue Ltd acquired the shares on 10 April 2018, it did not have a purpose of disposing of them.

The Business Solution Blueprint will define the highest order articulation of what the Business Transformation (BT) Programme delivers. It is a business-led high level view of the Programme that spans change enablement, customer experience, policy, business process, application and technology. This Executive Summary will discuss the fundamental characteristics of the Customer Experience (CX) business solution architecture that Inland Revenue (IR) will need to realise the vision for transformation, providing a succinct summary of the future state. This section will also include an overview of the impact this future state will have on IR’s customers, business partners, intermediaries and staff. Finally, this Executive Summary shows how to navigate the comprehensive Blueprint to find additional detail in areas of specific interest. Foundation of the Future State 1.1 The future state Customer Experience business solution architecture will deliver the changes necessary to transform IR into an organisation that “moves customers to cost-effective channels while creating an environment to make it easy for customers to self-manage 1 ”. At a high level, the changes from current state to future will be realised through five design architecture characteristics, outlined below 2 . Figure 1. Future State Characteristics of the Customer Experience Architecture Further detail on each of these future state characteristics of the CX changes will be outlined in the following sub-sections. NOTE: The characteristics represented and explained within this document summarise key themes and concepts that exist throughout the underlying design. They exist as a 1 Transformation Mobilisation Programme, Transformation Briefing Pack Level 3. 2 Outreach is defined as proactive customer engagement to increase awareness and educate customers to facilitate compliance.

The CX architecture will provide greater availability and access of self- management options to customers across channels. This will be supported by greater automation of contact across all interactions and enabled through the improvement of existing channels and the introduction of new and emerging channels. The future state architecture characteristics will include the following elements. Automating customer interactions. The CX architecture will deliver market-leading tools such as virtual digital assistant, click-to-chat voice and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) to increase the availability and pervasiveness of automated and digital contact. Providing validation of information at source. The CX architecture will enable validation at the time the customer provides information rather than after submission, helping them resolve errors before it is received by processing systems. Making greater use of emerging digital channels. The CX architecture will expand IR’s flexible design and delivery processes from traditional channels to embrace mobile web applications, email, SMS, API, B2B and social media channels. What is the benefit 3 ? Customers will have a wider variety of interaction channels. This will reduce their compliance burden through the convenience of anytime, anywhere access to information, submission and education – increasing their confidence of knowing what to do, how to do it and whether what they’ve done is right the first time, helping customers self-manage. Specific benefits are listed below. Improved compliance rate, improved customer experience. Customer compliance burden will be reduced by increasing self-management options, including submission of information and extending use of information to reduce manual entry and duplication across services. Greater self-management will reduce overall cost-to-serve. Improved customer experience. Customers will have wider variety of choice about how they interact with IR, adopting and moving between channels according to needs and preferences during interactions. Capability will be improved and effort reduced through personalisation, increased availability and access to digital channels and tools 4 . Improved accuracy of assessments, calculations, reduced invalid claims. Errors and manual processing will be reduced by preventing errors at source with improved up-front validation and near real time confirmation. The use of self-managed digital services will provide customers with the confidence that what they’ve done is right. Increase efficiency of (non-sourced) IR operations. Where assistance is required, for the self-managed customer it will be rapidly provided through a variety of automated and interactive options. Reducing customer contact for simple activities, queries and transactions will provide improvement in cost-to-service operations. 3 The bold bulleted benefits have been sourced from the Transformation Briefing Pack. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 13 of 186 Improved customer experience. Increased availability of secure digital services will allow customers to interact at the time of their choice and be provided with immediate feedback and validation of results, reducing the burden on customers and increasing the certainty that what they’ve done it right and that IR has gotten it right. The following examples are intended to show possible applications of this CX architecture future state characteristic and should be considered for illustrative purposes only and should be read in conjunction with the detailed customer scenarios and personas which provide a full view of the Customer Experience. Automating Customer Interaction: An Example Customer interactions will be automated, reducing the need to contact IR staff in order to find information or answers. For example, when Phil, a student loan borrower is preparing to permanently leave the country, he is contacted when IR receives information from the Department of Internal Affairs that his visa has been approved. Phil doesn’t have to do anything further he has some questions on his student loan obligations when he becomes an overseas borrower. He will be able to use virtual digital assistance to guide him to relevant information and answers. Instead of Phil calling IR during operating hours, or emailing IR through secure email and having to wait for a reply, the virtual digital assistant will be able to use his details, information, segmentation and sentiment to tailor and highly personalise the interaction at any time through an internet enabled device. This will increase the availability of help and support, through digital channels. Using a set of prompts and dialogue, Phil will be guided to find the right information and answers to complete his interaction. If Phil has further questions or is unable to find the right answer, he will be automatically referred to an IR staff member through the click-to-chat functionality at the most natural and appropriate point during his interaction. Using sentiment analysis and any additional information Phil provided during his interaction with the virtual digital assistant will assist the IR staff member to provide a deeper level of personalisation. Based on this, Phil will be able to talk to someone without the need to repeat information to have his questions answered quickly. Validating at Source: An Example In the future, information will be validated in near real time, providing assurance that customers are entering the correct information the first time and reducing uncertainty of getting their obligation calculation wrong. An example of this is where large employers have their payroll information prepopulated into payroll software based on information held within IR, allowing the organisation to accept the information or update it with latest details. Where appropriate, significant enterprises may also be prompted to correct information that doesn’t appear to be correct prior to submission, allowing processing and calculations to be done with the most complete and correct information. This will increase accuracy and certainty that information is correct at a point in time for employer, employees and IR. Adapting to New Digital Channels: An Example As customers become more mobile and connected, IR will be able to adapt to easily design and implement channels and tools that have high usage or that customers are most familiar with. As customers become more akin to using social media channels to interact with family, friends, businesses and government 4 , IR will be able to extend its social media reach to listen, communicate, engage and respond to customers 5 . For example, IR knows that a high number of student loan borrowers are based in London. Using trend analysis, IR will know that Google+ is used more than Facebook by student loan borrowers to connect to friends. Based on this, IR is able to expand and adapt its social media presence to inform the students of 4 2014 BDO Social Media Survey - How social media is bridging the gap between #localgov and citizens. 5 KDD207 Social Media Interaction Model. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 14 of 186 impending policy changes for overseas student loan borrowers and reply to questions about their situation. When a student has a question about this, they may choose to engage with IR through the social media channel of their choice and based on IR’s response, learns that they does not need to take any action as their employers have already provided the information required. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 15 of 186 1.1.2 Tailoring and Personalising Services and Channels How does the architecture support this? The CX architecture will enable services that use data-driven insights into customer preferences, circumstances and behaviour to personalise and tailor information and content to their experience and interactions. Rich insights covering behaviours, channel usage and interactions will be used to influence service design will be embedded within key decision-making points across the Omni-channel. A deep customer understanding will enable IR to personalise content and services and build trust with customers. The future state architecture characteristics will include the following elements. Monitoring interactions across the Omni-Channel experience. The CX architecture may monitor and record information across digital and non-digital interactions and channels and from external digital sources such as social media. From this deeper insights into customer needs will be extracted to guide decision-making. Personalising content based on segmentation of customers. The CX architecture will use data-driven insights to tailor and customise content and information provided to customers across the Omni-Channel experience. Managing campaigns and marketing. The CX architecture will use data-driven insights to focus education and marketing to influence customer behaviours through the personalisation of content to ensure it is relevant to customers at the right time. Delivering digital content management. The CX architecture will deliver greater use and volume of relevant digital content, including video, images and text to enable greater agility of communications to inform customers. Designing for events. The CX architecture will enable a deeper understanding of customer life events to proactively offer the right service and information to customers, detect and interpret event triggers and reduce the need to deal with tax administration. What is the benefit 6 ? Tailored and personalised services will improve customer experience by providing customers with information, content and service engagement that is highly relevant to their needs and circumstances. This will make it easier to comply by offering service that promotes compliance as is the natural outcome of an interaction. Specific benefits are listed below. Improve compliance rate, improved customer experience. Services and channel experiences will be differentiated based on circumstances with a tighter coupling of insight from Intelligence to deliver tailored services and interactions. Understanding customer lifecycles will allow IR to identify key events in which to engage customers, making it easier for customers to interact with and trust IR systems and processes. Improve compliance rate, improved customer experience. Greater availability of personalised information to circumstances will reduce compliance burden and provide confidence that customers have access to right information they need to comply. Increase efficiency of (non-sourced) IR operations. IR will have greater ability to modify and amend content to better inform and assist customers. Making content and information more relevant to customers’ situations and needs will help foster more inclusive interactions and allow more efficient use of IR resources, including reduced cost-to-serve channels and nature of simple customer queries and complaints. 6 The bold bulleted benefits have been sourced from the Transformation Briefing Pack. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 16 of 186 The following examples are intended to show possible applications of this CX architecture future state characteristic and should be considered for illustrative purposes only and should be read in conjunction with the detailed customer scenarios and personas which provide a full view of the Customer Experience. Managing and Personalising Digital Content using Segmentation: An Example In the future, customers will receive content and information that will be informed by customer profile, preference and insights gathered and generated by the Intelligence Led solution. This will enable personalisation and tailoring of services and interactions, based on behaviours rather than a one size fits all approach. For example, Zack, an American Entrepreneur thinking about starting a business in NZ, will be able to find and receive the relevant and timely information he needs on starting a new business in New Zealand. As Zack has searched for information on the IR and other Government websites, IR knows he is looking to start a new business. Through his visa application, he falls into the “new NZ business, Start-Up, high technology use” segment. IR will be able to use this segmentation to further personalise content and information, including providing Zack with videos, presentations and images on the next steps in the process of starting his new business, accounting software packages and how to self-manage his relationship with IR. Monitoring Interactions across the Omni-Channel Experience: An Example Intermediaries, such as tax agents, rely heavily on information provided by IR to facilitate tax compliance for their customers. For example, intermediaries will be able to search for information on the best way to deal with complex business structures such as trusts and partnerships and what the subsequent obligations are. Tax agents may be able to access information services through websites via their mobile on the way to visit clients, or find information quickly on their laptop by virtual digital assistance to get their questions answered. IR will be able to monitor and record tax agents’ interactions as they move from one channel and medium to another. Managing Event Based Campaigns and Marketing: An Example Being able to respond to changes in customer behaviour through having a wider perspective on the events that will occur in the lives of customers will enable IR to provide better whole-of-customer experiences. Where patterns of behaviour are detected, IR will be able to anticipate information needs and push information to customers with similar situations. For example, IR knows that Twin Peaks Sports Club hold their annual general meeting in the last week of September every year. At the start of the month IR will send them information so that the club knows what they need to do to keep their nominated person information up-to-date. At the end of October IR has had no response from the club and sends them a friendly reminder. Starting a business in NZ? Welcome to NZ! IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 17 of 186 1.1.3 Embedding Customer Centric Emphasis in Design and Delivery How does the architecture support this? The CX architecture will use a customer centric approach when designing and refining services and channels to develop a more informed and more relevant outcome. It will also enable a customer centric approach to delivery of services and channels, supporting a natural evolution of understanding behaviours and designing for services based on changing customer needs and circumstances. The future state architecture characteristics will include the following elements. Supporting co-design and collaboration with customers. The CX architecture will provide processes and technology that will support IR to co-design services across end- to-end processes with customers and business partners, providing more relevant services based on a better understanding of the range and diversity of customer needs. Responding to customer events. The CX architecture will be structured to respond to changes in behaviours over time, helping IR learn how to improve life event triggers and responses based on the whole-of-customer impact. Listening to customers across the Omni-channel. The CX architecture will monitor and record information across interactions and channels. Deeper insight into behaviour and motivation will be extracted to guide future service delivery improvements. Continuously delivering service improvements. The CX architecture will embed data-driven insights into its flexible delivery model, which will provide the ability for IR to rapidly adapt to changing needs in customer facing services and channels. What is the benefit 7 ? A customer centric approach to design and delivery will enhance the overall customer experience by better meeting the needs and diversity of each Customer Group, including providing services that support customers through end-to-end lifecycles. Customer burden and non-compliance will be reduced as a result, making it easy for customers to do the right thing and difficult to make errors or commit fraud. Specific benefits are listed below. Improve compliance rate, improved customer experience. Design and delivery of customer facing services and channels will evolve from the current rigid processes and systems of today to ones that are more adaptable and responsive to customer events, environment and social change. Voluntary compliance will be a natural outcome of improved experience by making it easier for customers to interact with IR. Customer experience will be enhanced through fostering an inclusive environment in which customers are actively involved in the design and delivery of services and channels. Increase efficiency of (non-sourced) IR operations. Service design change, whether identified by data-driven insights or directly through constant involvement and engagement with customers, will be realised through continuous improvement initiatives and will be met with on-going rapid innovation. Being flexible and adaptable when reacting to changes will allow more efficient use of IR resources, including reduced cost to service channels and reduced customer queries and complaints. Better solution design for changes, improved perception of IR and All-Of- Government. More agility in the delivery of customer facing services improvements will reduce the time taken to deliver new and improved services to customers and will ultimately improve the overall perception of IR and government. 7 The bold bulleted benefits have been sourced from the Transformation Briefing Pack. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 18 of 186 The following examples are intended to show possible applications of this CX architecture future state characteristic and should be considered for illustrative purposes only and should be read in conjunction with the detailed customer scenarios and personas which provide a full view of the Customer Experience. Co-Design and Collaboration with the Customer: An Example New tools and processes will mean that IR will be able to collaborate with a wide range of customers during the design process. When the legislation around GST is amended, customers and business partners will be engaged to collaborate and co-design the potential changes to systems and end-to-end processes and help determine the potential impact to IR and customers. For example, S&W Software, a trusted software developer business partner, together with IR will be able to co-create the solution and test the supporting services to ensure the desired outcome is achieved across different channels. Detecting and Responding to Customer Events: An Example Customers will often be unaware of events that occur in their life that may impact their personal entitlement or obligation. Alternatively individuals can be so consumed by the event that informing IR of changes is not top of mind. This may result in full entitlements not being received or obligations falling behind. For example, when Liz Daniel’s husband dies, she will be able to register his death with the Department of Internal Affairs and IR will simultaneously receive this information. Based on this event being detected, IR will trigger an action to close her husband’s account, reducing the compliance burden on the grieving family as well as ensuring timely action is taken. IR knows that Liz’s husband usually interacted with IR and based on the event of his passing, Liz and her nominated person will be sent information and material on any future obligations that Liz may need to meet. Listening to Customers Across the Channels: An Example Future design approaches will be supported by the collection of customer behaviours across channels. Understanding when and why customers choose to use one channel over another, or switch between channels will enable IR to respond to customer demand and design services to better meet the needs of customers. For example, as Zack, the American Entrepreneur, searches for information on how to start a business on IR and other Government Agency websites, apps and on forums, IR will be able to track and monitor his interactions. If Zack chooses to go to a start-up business seminar once he is in NZ, IR will be able to use this to gain deeper insights into behaviours and motivations of Zack or customers like him. Continuous Delivery of Service Improvement: An Example Using data-driven insights and information, IR will be able to monitor when services fail, channels are not effective through drop-off rates and when customers need additional support. IR will be able to rapidly adapt to the changing needs of customers and continuously improve services and channels. For example, as customers move to using more social media channels, IR will be able to expand the Register and Enrol service to allow customers to use social media accounts to enrol into products using their social media account details and events.

Integrated Solutions IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 19 of 186 1.1.4 Enabling Greater Outreach, Communication and Collaboration How does the architecture support this? The CX architecture will enable greater outreach (awareness and education), communication and collaboration with customers by providing the channels and tools to do so. This will be made complete with substantial, effective and intriguing content, driven by frontend user experience and technologies. Together with data sharing and exchange, this will create robust content and knowledgebase. The future state architecture characteristics will include the following elements. Delivering content authoring, publishing and digital asset management. The CX architecture will support greater use and increasing volumes of digital content, including video, images and text. Digital content management will support the agility of communications to inform customers, ensuring consistency, relevance and timeliness. Designing relevant channels around devices. The CX architecture will support the need to cater for different devices, whether via apps or responsive design, to address changing trends of customers shifting towards devices such as mobile and tablets. Improving experience across all channels. Having robust content will not be beneficial if customers find it hard to navigate, access and search for information. The CX experience will take a customer centric approach and ensure channels and platforms are designed with the customer in mind. Personalising information and communication messages. With the support of Intelligence Led insights and customer profiling, the CX architecture will focus on the provision of highly personalised and targeted information available to customers at the right time, through preferred channels, which will help increase obligation and entitlement awareness and understanding of what to do, therefore reduce burden. Evaluating communication, outreach and collaboration effectiveness at the time of campaign/distribution. The CX architecture will allow IR to proactively listen and engage with customers and leverage information generated by Intelligence Led processes to gain a deeper understanding of pain points and behaviours, ultimately informing campaigns, education and information distribution. What is the benefit 8 ? Increases in awareness and education will reduce compliance burden as well as improve services and products. Experience is enhanced through trust that IR will provide education and campaigns at the right time, where needed. Specific benefits are listed below. Improved customer experience. Communication and collaboration tools will be standardised, streamlined and personalised to profiles, preferences and interactions. Automated delivery will allow customers to receive targeted, relevant, timely content delivered through the Omni-Channel experience reducing the amount of manual effort. Better solution design for changes, improved customer experience. IR will have the ability to measure and discover improvement initiatives through Intelligence Led capabilities to ensure that customers are constantly involved and engaged. Better solution design for changes. There will be an improved ability to create continuous improvement initiatives that will enhance customer engagement, through proactively listening to customers and business partners. 8 The bold bulleted benefits have been sourced from the Transformation Briefing Pack. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 20 of 186 The following examples are intended to show possible applications of this CX architecture future state characteristic and should be considered for illustrative purposes only and should be read in conjunction with the detailed customer scenarios and personas which provide a full view of the Customer Experience. Managing Personalised Information and Messages: An Example IR will be able to present information that will be personalised by the customer to suit their individual needs. For example, Zack is new to GST and needs detailed information and educational messages, while over time as his knowledge, behaviour and confidence increases he will need less education and detail. In giving customers the ability to personalise what they need – in the format that they prefer such as text/graphic or video – information delivered is more relevant. IR will be able to manage the content and format easily through authoring, publishing and digital asset management tools, reducing the effort and time taken to personalise information and content. Designing Around Channels and Devices: An Example IR will design services that customers will be able to access from a range of channels and devices while still providing a positive experience. For example, when Zack makes an enquiry about GST obligations through his laptop, he will receive a different service and experience compared to making an enquiry via a mobile app. On his laptop Zack may have access to a virtual digital assistant in which his enquiry will be received and resolved. Using his mobile app, Zack may be able to submit an enquiry on the go and receive the resolution once he is back at the office.

IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 21 of 186 1.1.5 Extending the Digital Border and Use of Business Partners How does the architecture support this? The CX architecture will enable IR to extend its digital border 9 and make greater use of business partners to provide richer data and information on customers, trends and life events as well as services on behalf or jointly with IR, where they are better placed to do so 10 . This will enable IR to provide a consistent set of core customer services, delivered through end-to-end processes where required. The future state architecture characteristics will include the following elements. Enabling greater use of business partners. The CX architecture will support the use of business partners to provide information, services, channels, or products on behalf of or jointly with IR through the integration of internal systems and end-to-end or partial processes with external providers. Supporting the management of business partners. The CX architecture will provide processes to enable and support stronger management through business partner management tools, people and end-to-end processes. Opening up data and services to business partners, intermediaries and customers. The CX architecture will enable data and information to be open and available for customers, business partners and intermediaries to access and use to enable crowdsourcing and analytics. Improving the ability for IR to facilitate innovation with external parties. The CX architecture will increase the ability for IR, business partners, intermediaries and customers coming together to collaborate, design and produce ideas, services and products through digital collaboration and co-design tools and processes. Implementing the ability for IR to receive information through digital and emerging channels. The CX architecture will provide the ability for information to be submitted and provided through digital and emerging channels, which will decrease the burden for customers to provide information and increase the amount IR will receive. What is the benefit 11 ? Leveraging the capability and expertise of business partners will improve the Customer Experience. Specific benefits are listed below. Improved customer experience. IR will enhance its service offering to take advantage of the capabilities and expertise of business partners. Services with business partners will be more integrated, creating a consistent and seamless experience regardless of who facilitates the interaction with customers. Improved perception of IR and All-Of-Government. Information, channels, services and products will be created and/or managed on behalf of or jointly with IR. Reduce invalid claims. Information and data provided through the extension of IR’s digital border will provide richer data for IR to utilise and generate intelligence for customer and risk profiling. 9 Extending the Digital Border is defined as the extension of IRs digital boundary to include digital services delivered indirectly by business partners (eg, software developers and other government agencies collecting information on behalf of Inland Revenue). 10 Transformation Mobilisation Programme, Transformation Briefing Pack Level 3. 11 The bold bulleted benefits have been sourced from the Transformation Briefing Pack. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 22 of 186 Increased influence on social policy development. IR will be more adaptable to policy, social and environmental changes by leveraging the strengths, capabilities and expertise of business partners and intermediaries. The following examples are intended to show possible applications of this CX architecture future state characteristic and should be considered for illustrative purposes only and should be read in conjunction with the detailed customer scenarios and personas which provide a full view of the Customer Experience. Providing Services through Business Partners: An Example IR will be able to extend its Digital Border and leverage the expertise and knowledge of business partners such as government agencies to design and offer services jointly with IR. For example, IR, customers and business partners, will be able to co-design and create a service that will make it easier for businesses to manage GST or VAT on goods or services purchased overseas. Here IR, eBay, PayPal, MBIE and OECD agencies will work together to offer services to automatically collect GST or VAT from goods purchased overseas. IR will be able to leverage seller provided information from eBay as well as data held by other agencies, such as the NZBN and payment information from PayPal to collect the correct GST or VAT amount directly at the point of sale, regardless of the country of the seller. Managing Business Partners: An Example Customers, business partners and IR will have access to a community through secure digital collaboration tools and platforms. When a new tax type is announced by Parliament and changes need to be made quickly, IR will be able to identify and engage trusted Software Developers to work collaboratively on the changes required. Data and services will be open and Software Developers will have access to the information, data and context needed to work on legislation changes with IR and other government agencies. Due to the flexible and secure digital platform, discussions can be had with trusted partners about the benefits of implementing any new innovations that transpire in the collaboration tool. Once legislation changes are approved, updates to both IR and Software Developer systems will be managed through agile development and implementation. Customers will be able to see the benefits immediately after implementation, increasing trust in the Government. It’s time to book my appointment with a Midwife! Paid parental leave XYZ Corp Innovating with External Parties: An Example IR will be able to innovate with external parties such as government agencies and employers to collaborate and innovate on services. For example, IR, midwives and employers will be able to design and create a service that jointly will have greater benefits for IR and customers. When a midwife registers a new patient, they will be able to enrol them into paid parental leave, with the correct and most accurate information validated by the customer at that point in time. IR will be able to leverage customer provided information as well as data held by the employer, such as the date of parental leave to trigger a calculation for the correct paid parental leave amount, prepopulate forms, information and notifications to provide personalised correspondence to the mother whilst she is with the midwife. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 23 of 186 1.1.6 Overview of the Impact on IR’s Customers, Business Partners and Staff Shifting from the current state to the future state will have impacts on IR’s customers, business partners, intermediaries and IR staff. An early view and summary of impacts from the Customer Experience Business Process Architecture include the following. Customers, Business Partners and Intermediaries The changes and timing will drive different impacts for Customer Groups and will also vary depending on their channel choice. Some customers will require a capability uplift to gain new skills, shift mind-sets to digital and use new processes and systems. There may be an initial compliance cost to adopt and use new digital tools. With increasing sophistication of accounting software intermediary business models will likely need to evolve – spending less time on tax return preparation and potentially more time on advisory services. Digital customers will have the ability to self-manage in near real time and this, combined with IR’s use of Business Partner information/intelligence (for example, government agencies/banks) means IR will be able to provide a tailored service that takes into account customer lifecycles, behaviours and needs. This will reduce the need for individuals to contact IR direct and will assist in ensuring compliance and getting their correct entitlements from the start. Customers will still have a choice of channels. There is likely to be a need for incentives or clear benefits to be shown to move some customers – their experiences and channel choice will change over time particularly if they adopt a digital model. In addition, good business systems and processes supported by digital and near real time improvements will help businesses run more efficiently. Collaboration with business partners (eg, software developers) and intermediaries will enhance customer communication and education choices. Government agencies, in addition to making payroll changes for their employees, may also need to make core system and process changes relating to deductions for their customers. IR Staff Significant increase in automation, customer self-management and education will result in a reduction in manual work, validation, errors and customer contacts. The proportion of complex customer issues will increase requiring a capability shift, embedding of customer and compliance analysis across IR and the use of new tools and technologies. Channel shift to digital service delivery with a wider service window enabled by virtual assistance and more digital customer contacts. This will have implications in terms of IR’s “working window” 12 . Micro-segmentation of customers will enable a more practical and specific service from IR, with services tailored to customer needs: our people will need to utilise the information available and adapt their approach to the customer’s circumstances quickly regardless of channel. Near real time environment will require a shift in the way of working, to provide faster manual response times to manage complex queries. 12 As per KDD206 - Future State Customer Services Levels and KDD204 - Future State Customer Service, further refinements and decisions on service availability and channels will be made at the Detailed Design stage. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 24 of 186 Increased co-design with our customers and increased use of business partners to deliver services will require a different skillset and mind-set in the development of services and customer interactions. Further information on impacts is documented within the Business Processes in Section 4 of this document and a consolidated view can be found in Appendix F. A comprehensive organisational impact assessment (IR staff and customers) deliverable will be completed in October 2015 by the Organisational Change Management team, following the Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) vendor decision and finalisation of Programme Delivery Plan for Stages 1 to 4.

EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 6 of 93 1 Executive Summary The Business Solution Blueprint will define the highest order articulation of what the Business Transformation (BT) Programme delivers. It is a business-led high level view of the Programme that spans change enablement, policy, business process, application and technology. This Executive Summary will discuss the fundamental characteristics of the Enterprise Support Services (ESS) business solution architecture that Inland Revenue (IR) will need to realise the vision for transformation. It also provides a succinct summary of the future-state and includes an overview on the impact this future-state will have primarily on IR’s staff and stakeholders. Finally, this Executive Summary shows how to navigate the comprehensive Blueprint to find additional detail in areas of specific interest. Of importance to note is that the delivery of this future state architecture for Enterprise Support Services is a pre-requisite for much of the cultural and organisational changes that are required for the entire Business Transformation to be successful. 1.1 Foundation of the Future-State The future state Enterprise Support Services architecture will enable delivery of changes necessary to transform IR into a highly responsive and adaptive organisation. At a high level, the changes from current state to the future state will be realised through four architectural characteristics, outlined below: Figure 1. Future-State of the Enterprise Support Services Architecture NOTE: The characteristics represented and explained within this document summarise key themes and concepts that exist throughout the underlying design. They exist as a summarisation and communication tool and are neither inclusive of all design content nor are traceable to underlying design inputs. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 7 of 93 The following sub-sections summarise the key features of the four future-state characteristics and their impact on IR’s operations and resources. 1.1.1 Driving Enterprise Excellence How does the architecture support this? The ESS architecture will help drive enterprise excellence by providing the following. •An enterprise performance management framework that will drive efficiency into the process of managing enterprise performance. The framework includes an iterative model that defines operational KPIs and targets in line with strategic KPIs, enables business planning, resource allocation and budgeting to achieve strategic objectives, and uses the monitoring and variance analysis to make informed decision and finally to refine strategic targets. •A consolidated view of organisational performance that will provide Senior Management with a line of sight across individual operations and business units with leading and lagging performance indicators to help achieve the strategic objectives. •An integrated solution that will capture and report information from business units, programs, projects and processes that makes up the strategic KPIs. This will be supported by multi-level exception reporting enabling timely and proactive decision making and modelling of decisions. •An integrated planning, budgeting and forecasting process that will help manage multi-year budgets with inputs from business and programs/project plans and resource allocations that have been developed in line with the strategic objectives. What is the benefit 1 ? Improving the capability to drive enterprise excellence will deliver a number of benefits including the following. •Increase efficiency of IR operations. Integrated analytical reporting with self- service functionality will lead to reduced effort in preparing reports and reduced time to identify problem areas, thereby enabling the Leadership to decide and course-correct in time, to improve effectiveness of the operations. •Improved investment (portfolio) management. Improved analytical reporting and decision-making will lead to more clarity on the future state of the organisation, enabling better investment prioritisation. The following example is intended to show one of the possible applications of this ESS architecture feature and should be considered for illustrative purposes only. Driving Enterprise Excellence: An Example Charles, an ELT member, notices on his reporting dashboard that the Portfolio Office has a projected budget over-run with four months to spare in the current fiscal year. The report shows that 70% of the programmes and projects are incurring a higher spend, due to excessive use of third-party contractors. He asks his team to investigate the increase in the ratio of contractors to employees. After a quick analysis his team informs him that the Technology team is encountering an increase in attrition and has been unable to recruit employees, especially because of higher demand for people with higher technology skills in the market. Armed with this information, Charles calls for a meeting with other ELT members and proposes that as a stop-gap measure, a proven implementation of market based remuneration be applied to this group. As a longer-term action, he suggests that steps are to be taken to promote IR’s employee value proposition within the organisation. 1 The bulleted benefits have been sourced from the Transformation Briefing Pack. Refer to Section 4.4.3 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 8 of 93 1.1.2 Enhancing Enterprise Tools and Systems How does the architecture support this? The ESS architecture will enhance the enterprise tools and systems, to improve automated information sharing between the systems, by providing the following. Modern tools and systems that will allow the enterprise support processes to be transformed to meet the needs of IR for the future. A digital first approach that will support supplying and utilising information electronically wherever possible making it easier to access information from one source, and to workflow documents. An improved user experience through better integration, improved flexibility and updated tools. Integrated and common approach that will reduce manual effort, data error risk and improve the ability to report across processes. Access to near real time data and better data accessibility will provide opportunities for added value, better insights and improved value for money. What is the benefit 2 ? Increase efficiency of IR operations. oData will be available for integrated reporting giving greater confidence and integrity for reports which will also take less time to generate. oIntegrated tools and systems will enable accurate and timely reporting of financials and non-financials to internal and external stakeholders. oLeveraging a common integration framework will reduce the total cost of ownership as the organisation will not need to maintain skills to support multiple technologies. This will also achieve economies of scale with licensing. oAdopting a digital first approach will reduce the total effort by recording directly in the integrated system. The process will be completed in a shorter time and the risk of data entry mistakes when entering information from written forms will be removed. oBetter management of finances and contract spend will lead to operational savings. The following example is intended to show one of the possible applications of this ESS architecture feature and should be considered for illustrative purposes only. Enhancing Enterprise Tools and Systems: An Example Brian is a successful applicant for a role at IR. He receives and accepts his offer electronically. All personal details of Brian are transferred from the recruitment system to the HR system. Brian is sent an on boarding message from his new manager, Angelique, welcoming him to IR and provides key information about the role, the team, the department, location and day-one processes. This will allow Brian to complete some of the required training online from day one. Facilities Management, IT and other parts of the organisation have been automatically notified of Brian’s start date and on-boarding requirements have been completed, enabling Brian to be immediately productive in his role. 2 The bulleted benefits have been sourced from the Transformation Briefing Pack. Refer to Section 4.4.3 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 9 of 93 1.1.3 Delivering One Way of Working How does the architecture support this? The ESS architecture will assist delivering one way of working by providing the following. A robust process governance structure that will be aligned to the organisation’s strategy and goals that will enable processes to be managed with improved performance. Common processes that will support the reduction of business risk and improve quality and enable stronger performance. Simplified, standardised and integrated business processes that will enable uniformity of operating in the organisation, improve understanding of processes, make it easier to get things done and reduce training needs for staff moving to different groups. A single organisation hierarchy that will be used across enterprise-wide systems for workflow for faster approvals and as a single source of truth for organisation hierarchy. What is the benefit 3 ? Integrated and simplified leading processes will have the following benefits. Increased efficiency of IR operations. Processes will be designed to be consistent and to minimise the number of steps and manual processes leading to greater efficiency. Position movements within the organisation will not require the person to learn the process variations of the new business unit. Better Solution Design for Changes. With proper governance structure in place and simplified processes with minimal system customisation, a continuous improvement approach can be promoted and realised, reducing the potential for new process workarounds or manual processes. Reduced risk profile. A higher level of process compliance will reduce the overall risk profile of the business. The following example is intended to show one of the possible applications of this ESS architecture feature and should be considered for illustrative purposes only. Delivering One Way of Working: An Example In the future when Tom, who works in ICT Operations, is seconded to a different business unit and wishes to purchase a good or service he is able to follow the same process he used previously. Using the easily accessible online repository of business process documentation, Tom learns of the minor variations of the purchasing process between the different categories of goods and services to be procured. While executing the process for a specific category of goods, Tom realises that the process variation for that category does not actually meet the needs. He talks to other people, who purchase other goods in the same category, and confirms that the variation does not actually suit the category. Using the online process repository, he raises a request to make the necessary changes to the process variation. The request is then evaluated by the process owner, for accuracy and completeness, and for impacts on other related processes and people, and is discussed and approved in the Business Process Management governance meeting. The process documentation is updated with the variation and all related parties are informed of the change. 3 The bulleted benefits have been sourced from the Transformation Briefing Pack. Refer to Section 4.4.3 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 10 of 93 1.1.4 Supporting Our People to Achieve How does the architecture support this? The ESS architecture will enable attracting, developing and engaging a workforce fit for the future by providing the following. •Talent management processes that will support the identification, recruitment, development, performance, engagement and exit of our workforce. •Common processes and improved systems that will minimise administrative and manual activities, thereby allowing people to focus more on value-added activities. •Extended self-service functions that will provide access to the structured information needed by staff and managers in managing their business. •Clear accountabilities and responsibilities for our people that will assist in improving performance. What is the benefit 4 ? •Increase efficiency of IR operations. Improving the workforce planning will reduce the time and effort and give greater certainty to budgeting and staffing decisions. •Improved perception of IR and All-of-Government. By introducing modern talent management processes, IR can have greater confidence that the total efforts of the organisation’s members will be aligned to the objectives stated at an executive level. The workforce will be able to manage their career more proactively leading to greater levels of engagement. This may have an additional benefit of improving the reputation of IR as an employer of choice and therefore improve the ability of IR to attract and retain key talent. •Increase efficiency of IR operations. By ensuring there is a correct, robust and sustainable organisation structure with supporting processes and controls, the business will be able to maximise the use of system enabled workflow to route approvals to the correct person. Support for mobile workflow approvals will further enhance the efficiency of processes. The following example is intended to show one of the possible applications of this ESS architecture feature and should be considered for illustrative purposes only. Supporting Our People to Achieve: An Example Angelique uses a common tool to review the staffing requirements for her business unit in the next two to five years. This is done using a common catalogue of jobs and competencies. The identified resource requirements are included in the business plans, which in turn inform the budgeting process. Budgets are then developed with this information. Once approved the budget is translated into changes to the organisation structure and will influence the planning for recruitment. Once recruited staff members are inducted in the process called out in the example for “Enhancing Enterprise Tools and Systems”. New talent management processes give greater clarity and self-service capabilities for people such as Brian to take charge of their own career pathway including self-development and feedback through an integrated learning system. 4 The bulleted benefits have been sourced from the Transformation Briefing Pack. Refer to Section 4.4.3 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 11 of 93 1.1.5 Overview of the Impact on IR’s Operations and Resources Shifting from the current state to the ESS future-state architecture will impact IR’s employees, stakeholders, operations, resources and third parties, with new ways of working, such as the following. Improved and extended use of self service Increased self-service will require managers and their teams to use new tools and rely on, consume and analyse the information provided in the reports, instead of on others to perform these tasks. This increase in self-service will result in a reduction of manual work, manual validations and support requests. For some people this will require a change in mind-set, as they might be used to relying more on people rather than systems. Streamlined automated processes Streamlined and highly automated processes with in-built audit trails and validations will lead to greater compliance and mean less manual workarounds and less opportunity to create local process variations. This in turn will lead to greater efficiency and enable staff to move around the organisation more easily due to having consistent processes and ways of working. Capability and work type shift from transactional to analytical Automation, self-service, improved information, integration of systems and processes and better management of data will result in better information and provide an opportunity to create intelligence and more value from the information. This in turn will see a reduction in the need for transactional data input work in support areas and will increase the need for higher level skills in interpreting information, providing more holistic views and advice for business managers. This will require new skill sets in data analysis, partnering and up skilling in the use and support of new tools. It will also mean a shift in the resource mix for many support areas. Clear governance, accountabilities, roles and responsibilities A notable theme emerged around the need to clarify both existing and any new roles and governance arrangements. The lack of clarity in areas such as procurement, risk, projects, health and safety, enterprise reporting, process management and budgeting is driving inefficiency in IR. This clarification involves providing better information on the accountabilities, roles and responsibilities between the various business units. Move to collaboration and partnering models in support areas Combined with all of the above, support areas will look to provide better partnering relationships with business managers and externally with other government agencies and business partners to the benefit of the organisation. This would be delivered through uplift in capability and structures to support a business partnering concept. Cultural shift from “working for my business” to “working for IR” With the move to one way of doing business, extended self-service, business dashboards, system integration and standardised processes there is a need for managers and their people to manage their business unit well within the context of what is best for IR. This will require new ways of thinking and operating for some people, which needs to be supported by key organisational processes such as budgeting, performance management and job expectations.

This strategy highlights that IR faces an increasingly challenging environment and that a focus on doing things well (tactically) is not enough. IR must maximise its use of intelligence in decision making to ensure value is maximised by also doing the right things. The Intelligence Led Strategy notes: The ability to leverage intelligence is of critical importance in a world where an information scarce environment has shifted to one of information overload. Previously IR has not considered its decisions or its information in a fully co-ordinated way. To create maximum value for the customer and the enterprise, while dealing with both analytical and organisational complexity, IR must become an Intelligence Led organisation. These themes were reflected across the workshops held to develop the solution architecture and most importantly resoundingly supported by the breadth of the stakeholders that were engaged. The future state IL architecture that will be outlined in this document is specifically structured to transform IR’s current state architecture in five fundamental ways: 1 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 10 of 109 Figure 1. Future State characteristics of the Intelligence Led Architecture Further detail of each of these future state components of the IL changes will be outlined in the following sub-sections. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 11 of 109 1.1.1 Embracing richer, more managed data sources How does the architecture support this? The IL architecture will enable IR to evolve and extend its current limited sources of structured and unstructured data from third parties, business partners and customers to improve the collection of information and improve intelligence led interventions. This will not only enable IR to generate intelligence and deep insights, but will help facilitate data and information sharing across business partners, increasing the sharing of intelligence and information across government to improve delivery of services. The future state architecture characteristics will include the following elements. Data lake environments 2 . The IL architecture will support controlled and rapid ingestion of new data sources into a controlled yet agile environment to support initial exploration towards a better understanding of how they may enrich existing insights. Flexible, reusable business partner constructs. The velocity, veracity and volume of external data will be specifically addressed with reusable frameworks so that the drastically reduced administrative onus supports IR’s commitment to right-time decision-making. Rapid data quality and preparation. Reusable yet highly-specific data preparation processes will be readily available for meeting IR’s high standards for data quality and ingestion criteria. What is the benefit 3 ? As data and business experts identify a potentially valuable new source of external data, IR will be able to respond rapidly and safely by quickly establishing the necessary relationships before ingesting the information into a controlled, dedicated environment. The low overhead of establishing this relationship means IR will no longer need to incur lengthy delays attempting to prove the unknown value of the data and will be able to translate the benefits into improved decision-making at-speed. Informed assessment of the data to be accessed or exchanged enables better determination of whether it is necessary and relevant to both access and store the information. Balance of control and agility supports the need to govern ingestion and subsequent usage while recognising the diversity of potential data sources and formats presented by big-data. A richer data universe will strengthen the breadth and depth of insights that IR can unearth about its customers, their compliance patterns and their channel usage. Specific benefits are listed below. Improve compliance rate by providing deeper insight into a customer’s motivations, opportunities and capabilities for both compliant and non-compliant behaviours. 2 A scalable data repository built to capture data from any potential source, and in any potential format, for assessment and subsequent analysis in an agile but controlled manner. These data repositories support data discovery, ad-hoc research and investigations, advanced analytics, operational intelligence, business intelligence and reporting. Whilst still applying strict governance, security and control the key difference from a Data Warehouse being the ability to preserve data in its original format without requiring it to conform to a defined scheme. Integrating the lake with the rest of the tools and platforms that IR depends on, turns the data lake into an Enterprise Data Hub. 3 The bolded bulleted benefits have been sourced from the Transformation Briefing Pack. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 12 of 109 Improved accuracy of assessments by enriching the field of validation against which self-managed information can be immediately validated at the point of entry. Increase efficiency of IR operations by standardising design and execution of data quality activities such as cleansing, normalising and transforming attributes. The following examples are intended to show possible applications of this IL architecture feature and should be considered for illustrative purposes only and should be read in conjunction with the detailed customer scenarios and personas which provide a full view of the customer experience. Embracing Richer, Managed Data Sources: An Example Discussions with a third party with whom IR has an existing service relationship have identified the potential for a new data source to assist with the identification of changes in customer circumstance. Following the third party data governance process, Joanne an analyst who focuses on insights related to community compliance, seeks and obtains approval to assess the value of the new data source. Joanne receives a subset of the data for assessment and ingests this through the data lake in a controlled manner. With data now residing in the data lake, Joanne is able to analyse the data in the lab environment and simulate the impact and benefit from obtaining the wider dataset. Joanne is able to draw upon expertise of relevant subject matter experts to test the suitability of the data as well as placing the sample in context of information and knowledge already held. The data is only accessible to the lab at this point and its usage restricted. Having assessed value and quality attributes of the dataset, and determined its application, with the support of the wider business Joanne reports back to the governance process to seek approval to obtain the full dataset. Joanne uses the standard processes to setup agreements to bring the information into the organisation, defining how the data will be used and retained within IR. With an understanding of its application in IR, Joanne is also able to define the quality expectations of the data. Retention of the data in addition to its use will be subject to satisfying necessary and relevant criteria. Using the exchange data process, the full data set is securely obtained via an electronic transfer and ingested via a controlled and governed process directly into the data lake where it is automatically assessed to ensure the quality of the data meets the pre-defined expectations for IR. Within the Analytics Laboratory, the data is made available to support the extraction of new insights to support IR’s objectives, or the refinement of existing insights in response to the new information. Expertise from the wider business is drawn upon to support the on-going assessment and usage of the data. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 13 of 109 1.1.2 Extracting actionable insights about customers and their behaviours How does the architecture support this? The IL architecture will enable IR to gather together data, information and associated organisational knowledge and extract actionable insights. This includes providing both macro level insights based on trends, risk and behaviour and customer profile and micro level customer segmentation. This will allow specialists to extract targeted customer, compliance and behavioural insights which will then be used to aid investigation and case management, facilitate compliance, personalise customer interactions and inform decision makers. The future state architecture characteristics will include the following elements. Best-of-breed techniques. The IL architecture will expose a hybrid software suite to the full breadth of data available within the Analytics Laboratory environment and will frequently extend to embrace emerging market-leading products. Highly specialised analytics talent. The IL architecture will be directly supported by IR’s talent management and retention strategy to nurture and develop dedicated compliance, customer and service experience analytical experts. Collaborative visualisation and interpretation of results. The IL architecture will expose results in the Analytics Laboratory environment in such a way that it will be possible for insights to be digested by business experts, analytical specialists and translatory strategists alike, to support accuracy, usability and ultimate alignment to outcomes. Agile and reliable methods. The IL architecture will support work practices that promote agile, iterative model development and validation to expose only the most robustly considered results to service design and delivery processes. What is the benefit 4 ? IR will seek to understand all sources of uncertainty and use that knowledge when making decisions. Risk is defined as the effect of uncertainty on objectives (ISO 31000:2009); in taking an Intelligence Led approach, IR will focus on reducing the uncertainty associated with decisions across the organisation. Maintaining a customer centric approach to these decisions will help us focus on improving the customer experience by making it easier and simpler for customers to achieve their objectives while also reducing the cost of providing services. IR will gain a deeper understanding of current, predicted and simulated customer behaviours, compliance patterns, channel usage and community perceptions. This will be particularly critical where customer behaviour may include avoiding interaction with IR and its Business Partners. Specific benefits are listed below. Improve compliance rate by making it easier for customers to interact with IR systems and processes and directing proactive and reactive interventions based on a better understanding of a customer’s current and predicted compliance behaviours. Improved customer experience as a result of greater availability and tailoring of information to customer circumstances. 4 The bolded bulleted benefits have been sourced from the Transformation Briefing Pack. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 14 of 109 The following examples are intended to show possible applications of this IL architecture feature and should be considered for illustrative purposes only and should be read in conjunction with the detailed customer scenarios and personas which provide a full view of the customer experience. Using Best of Breed Techniques and Highly Specialised Analytics Talent: An Example Implementation of FATCA and other cross border information sharing initiatives has resulted in significant volumes of information to be analysed to understand potential for cross border tax avoidance within existing customer segments. Leveraging the Analytics and Insights Centre of Excellence (COE) the information received is ingested through the data lake into the lab environment where it is combined with the existing IR data universe for analysis. Specialists in the COE apply a range of techniques to develop and test a variety of models as they search for attributes and relationships that help identify potential tax avoidance in IR’s customer population. Given the breadth and significance of the challenge, within the COE a multi-disciplinary team is applied to the problem including: expertise in handling and processing significant volumes of data, data scientists to search for and identify correlations in the data; and management scientists help validate the insights to assess their applicability to changes in service design and to simulate the effect of applying the insights against common transactions and IR’s data holdings. The combined team works with agility throughout this process of discovery, learning as it goes and adjusting its use of techniques based on insights identified. Working Collaboratively to Visualise and Interpret the Results: An Example Continuing the example above, having identified the leading models and predictors the team shares their findings with business experts in service design and delivery. The group collaborate using simulation and visualisation of the different results. This will help optimise the opportunities to implement while balancing the processing requirements and potential service and policy impacts. Business experts leverage the visualisation of the options to communicate the preferred options and engage senior business stakeholders in a meaningful way. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 15 of 109 1.1.3 Embedding right-time insights across the organisation How does the architecture support this? The IL architecture will extend traditional information management processes to ensure that customers, business partners and IR are provided with the right information, and at the right time, to make informed, data-driven decisions. Applying actionable intelligence and insights with regard to customer and risk across the solution architecture will provide the organisation with increased surety through robust modelling techniques, reducing uncertainty associated with Strategic, Operational and Tactical decision-making. The future state architecture characteristics will include the following elements. Intelligence Led service design, not just delivery. The IL architecture will embed into the Core Tax and Social Policy (CTS) and Customer Experience (CX) architectures from design right through to delivery, to influence all aspects of the customer experience. Data-driven insight into behaviours. The IL architecture will expose and incorporate reliable, high-accurate insights into service design and delivery across the organisation as a whole, allowing decisions to be influenced by a rich insight into historic, current and even predicted future behaviours. Right-time data supporting right-time decisions. The IL architecture will provide insights that reflect the most current state of data available to the organisation, allowing decisions to be made as part of straight-through processing with confidence and accuracy. What is the benefit 5 ? Highly-accurate data-driven insights will rapidly be unearthed and made available at-speed to drive and support all aspects of IR’s decision-making. Objectives of these insights will be collaboratively agreed upfront and iteratively evaluated between business, systems and data experts to target the generation of actionable, useful results and foster greater confidence in the results. Results will be sourced as part of the service design process, allowing interactions to be proactively designed for positive outcomes. IR will gain a deeper understanding of current, predicted and simulated customer behaviours, compliance patterns, channel usage and community perceptions. Specific benefits are listed below. Improved customer experience by differentiating based on greater understanding of customer circumstances. Improve compliance rate by nurturing relationships with customers to facilitate compliance at each and every interaction. Improved accuracy of assessments by preventing errors at source with improved validation through the use of self-managed digital services. Increase efficiency of IR operations by reducing customer contact and transactions, increasing automation and improving the workflow of manual tasks. 5 The bolded bulleted benefits have been sourced from the Transformation Briefing Pack. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 16 of 109 The following examples are intended to show possible applications of this IL architecture feature and should be considered for illustrative purposes only and should be read in conjunction with the detailed customer scenarios and personas which provide a full view of the customer experience. Supporting Right-Time Decisions using Right-Time Data Driven Insight into Behaviours: An Example: As Phil is about to depart overseas permanently and has questions, he decides to contact IR through the automated click-to-chat tool. The IR staff member is able to support him as the most relevant up to date information regarding his taxation status and student loan liability is displayed on the IR staff’s screen. This provides a complete understanding of Phil’s circumstances and IR will be able to assist Phil in one interaction. Moreover, knowing that Phil is moving overseas, the system is able to derive insight from similar customers who moved overseas. Phil’s risk profile is re-calculated and based on this, Phil is pushed relevant education materials to ensure he knows his tax responsibilities while overseas. On the subsequent tax submission, when Phil is trying to enrol for an additional child support entitlement that he is not eligible for, the system will derive insight based on his latest life events and will not proceed to the next step until he has corrected the error. This process allows IR to prevent fraud from occurring in the first place. Influencing Intelligence Led Service Design, not just Delivery: An Example Zack, the American entrepreneur’s company has now been in business in New Zealand for the past 12 months. Up to now, he has used a variety of IR’s services, such as accounting software interfaces, PAYE and myIR to remain compliant. Business is booming and is on the verge of evolving from a small business, to a medium sized enterprise. IR is already aware of this, since they have a real-time view of the company revenue, profit, salaries and number of employees. Based on this information, Zack’s Interaction Profile is updated in right-time and personalised tax products on offer are sent to his business email address. After logging onto myIR, Zack’s landing page is updated with a listing of tax products and entitlements. Zack feels that IR is proactively helping him reduce his tax burden, so he gladly complies. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 17 of 109 1.1.4 Providing IR with seamless data flows How does the architecture support this? The IL architecture will manage and govern the access, ingestion, usage and exchange of data across the business partner network as a corporate asset. This will enable greater use of insights and information across services and channels within IR, and help to provide information to external parties in a practical, useful way. The future state architecture characteristics will include the following elements. Information managed as a corporate asset. Data, information and intelligence as a whole, regardless of its original source, will be governed and designed for with rigour so that it is considered and incorporated appropriately as part of service design. Governed, flexible exchange with business partners. Data and information will be carefully yet flexibly made available for business partners, including government agencies, to enrich their own insights about IR customers and channels. Exchange services will support expansion to include new business partners as they join IR’s network of partners. Centralised, consolidated management of knowledge and information. The IL architecture will support the centralised and managed availability of content, knowledge and information across IR, business partners and customers to help reduce redundant or conflicting information, and make the right information easily accessible. Contextualised knowledge and information. Metadata and contextual information about content and documents will be applied and stored. This will help customers, IR staff and business partners search for and locate relevant information at the most helpful time. What is the benefit 6 ? IR will manage and govern both its own data and that sourced externally as a corporate asset, allowing exchanges with business partners to occur in a controlled, high-quality manner. This includes controlled and governed access to federated data sources recognising that it may not be necessary and relevant or practical for IR to store customer information held by business partners or third parties. IR staff and business partners will have greater awareness of the importance of data quality and their role as stewards and custodians in maintaining data quality. Specific benefits are listed below. Increase efficiency of IR operations by reducing the amount of time and effort that customers, IR staff and business partners take searching for information. Improved customer experience by better understanding the context of information before exposing it to customers. Improved accuracy of assessments through reduced duplication and clearer versions of the truth. The following examples are intended to show possible applications of this IL architecture feature and should be considered for illustrative purposes only and should be read in 6 The bolded bulleted benefits have been sourced from the Transformation Briefing Pack. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 18 of 109 conjunction with the detailed customer scenarios and personas which provide a full view of the customer experience. Consolidating Insights through Well-Structured Hierarchies: An Example John Smith, a self-employed rural contractor, has recently moved properties and as part of the financing of his property has changed banking providers. Upon realising that he has not supplied his new address and bank account to IR wants to update his details. However, due to the move John does not yet have a reliable internet connection rather than use myIR as he normally would, he calls IR and updates the address. John as a regular internet channel user hasn’t enrolled with a voice biometric so John is routed by the IVR to a customer service representative who confirms with John points of identity. When the system processes this information, it automatically updates the address and bank account details and at the same time processes the information to analyse the change of details, the risk of this interaction, the nature of the transaction and John’s normal channel preference and behaviour to re-calculate John’s risk profile which has been increased. Due to incurring moving expenses a subsequent GST return filed on paper a few days later includes a refund. The refund transaction while being for a reasonably low value is at odds with John’s normal GST returns in which John has GST to pay. The GST transaction risk results in a high risk score due to the departure from his normal pattern of interaction, the proximity to the change of address and bank account details and John’s currently elevated risk score. Understanding the Context of Information: An Example Maxwell, an investigator in Rotorua is investigating an organisation, Jake’s Adventure Tours under suspicion of under reporting of employees PAYE. A case has been created to support the investigation and Maxwell is gathering information as background to his investigation prior to a scheduled visit to the organisation’s premises. As Maxwell reviews the information he uncovers intelligence regarding additional contact details including personal email addresses used by the proprietor Jake. Within the case management tool Maxwell collects and attributes these contact details to Jake where they become available for risk analysis but do not show up as part of Jake’s public record. Prior to visiting Jake, Maxwell is alerted of a suspicious GST refund for a recently registered company that has been held for further analysis due to its risk score. The risk score, already high due to the nature of the refund including the relative newness of the organisation, was deemed as higher risk through network association to the company under investigation via the email address identified in the investigation by Maxwell. When Maxwell reviews the case, visualisation of the entities involved shows him graphically the linkages between the two organisations, his case and the transactions under assessment. An updated risk perspective is shown via the icon colours and associated attributed in the visualisation. An unconfirmed relationship between the two organisations has been created that upon further investigation Maxwell may confirm. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 19 of 109 1.1.5 Continuously learning from insights, decisions and feedback How does the architecture support this? The IL architecture will use insights and feedback loops to provide an understanding of the effect of designs, decisions and actions taken by the organisation. This will allow IR to advance to a self-learning and highly adaptable organisation that has the foresight to swiftly respond to environmental, policy, social and customer changes. The future state architecture characteristics will include the following elements. Adaptive service design. The IL architecture will actively and continually champion the concept of behavioural change across the organisation. This will mean that new insights will be made available over time to assess and, if necessary, refine service design over time in response to natural and influenced changes in behaviours. Self-learning feedback loops. The IL architecture will use closed-loop feedback loops to support the on-going management of analytical techniques to refine, replace or retire insights as behaviours and objectives change. Use of sophisticated techniques to unearth learnings. The IL architecture will support highly-specialist staff in the application of advanced techniques in the Analytics Laboratory to uncover complex and highly-accurate relationships between the decision taken and the ultimate results. Generation of Actionable Intelligence. The IL architecture will leverage the collective organisational data and information, analytics, insights and human intelligence gathered by IR staff and Business Partners to provide actionable intelligence that supports strategic and operational decision making. Whole-of-customer impacts to IR and New Zealand. Approaches to learning will consider results from a wide range of perspectives in order to evaluate both localised and more wide-reaching results. What is the benefit 7 ? IR understands the dynamics of its environment and customers. In reflection of the Compliance Model, the IL architecture will recognise intelligence to be inclusive of insights related to customer behaviour and our ability to influence their motivations, capabilities to comply and opportunities to comply. IR staff and business partners will actively participate in the collection of human intelligence as a means to gather broader, richer customer insights and develop knowledge. The systematic analysis and application of the insights and knowledge will create a virtuous loop that reinforces and rewards the participation of staff and business partners in this process. IR will self-learn and constantly adapt to the effect these designs, decisions and interventions have on customers, communities, policies and experiences. Specific benefits are listed below. Increased accuracy of assessments based on extracted insights that are refined in response to the changes in behaviours that customers display. 7 The bolded bulleted benefits have been sourced from the Transformation Briefing Pack. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 20 of 109 Improve compliance rate by improved ability to predict likely outcomes before they occur, taking into account the impact that previous decisions have had in other instances. Improved customer experience by increased opportunities to proactively influence behaviours and nurture customer relationships for positive outcomes by better understanding how current interactions are likely to impact future ones. The following examples are intended to show possible applications of this IL architecture feature and should be considered for illustrative purposes only and should be read in conjunction with the detailed customer scenarios and personas which provide a full view of the customer experience. Learning Continuously from Insights, Decisions and Feedback: An example Recent analysis across existing IR data sources has identified a number of customers who were no longer receiving PAYE income. The acquisition of a new business partner data source into the Analytics Laboratory (Lab) allows IR to deduce that some of these customers, previously segmented as personal and family may actually be starting new businesses and can be segmented with a composite profile that recognises the customer has multiple reasons to interact with IR and more complex needs. A cross agency initiative with MBIE who have an existing strategic initiative focusing on supporting new and emerging businesses is created to determine needs and services for this emerging customer group and test the accuracy of IR’s deductions. The outcomes from the cross agency interactions are captured and fed back into IR’s Lab both as a natural data exchange between the Agencies and as structured feedback by staff involved in the initiative. Analysts in the Lab then add the feedback data into the analysis, new insights are gained and models are enhanced or created that improve IR’s ability to repeat the processes tested by the pilot on an on-going basis. The process once tested is implemented as business as usual with the feedback loops formally embedded. Customers are now treated based on their whole relationship with IR as determined by their new composite segments and the segmentation and interaction profiles continue to be updated (utilising the new insights and feedback) to inform on-going and continuous improvement on how IR and MBIE can identify and interact proactively with these customers. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 21 of 109 1.1.6 Supporting the Business Solution Architectures The previous sub-sections of this document detail the foundational transformations that the future state IL architecture will deliver to transform IR’s current state. Rather than deliver direct value to IR in and of themselves these transformational features will be fundamentally designed to support and enable the outcomes of key business solution architectures, namely: Core Tax and Social Policy (CTS) business solution architecture Customer Experience (CX) business solution architecture Enterprise Support Services (ESS) business solution architecture. To help contextualise this important outcome, the following three sub-sections will discuss how the foundational transformations of the future state IL architecture directly support the characteristics of the three above business solution architectures. 1.1.6.1 Supporting the Core Tax and Social Policy (CTS) Business Solution Architecture The following table will provide a high-level overview of how the IL architecture will support the key characteristics of the CTS architecture 8 . Please refer to the deliverable D007-HD Business Solution Blueprint for Core Tax and Social Policy for more details on the CTS architecture. Taking a service- centric approach The IL architecture will provide crucial support for IR’s move towards self- management by improving the ability to understand, identify, validate and respond to the diverse needs of an individual customer. More specifically, analytical insights extracted within the Analytics Laboratory will: Extend and complement calculation and validation rules for embedding within the CTS architecture, to support reliable, right- time responses and reduce post-transaction corrections. Unearth insights into customer service needs and usage behaviours and make these available during both service design and delivery to help specifically customise services and channels. Support the high-quality consolidation of data across disparate sources to deliver a customer-centric view of relevant, contextual data within the CTS architecture. 8 The Analytics Factory, as described in Appendix E of this document, represents the conceptual part of the business solution architecture in which insights emerging from the Analytics Laboratory will embed and execute. For clarity, the CTS architecture is specifically referenced here as the part of the Analytics Factory supported by the IL architecture. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 22 of 109 Being highly- automated and event-driven The IL architecture will play a key role in the reduction in reliance on customer-initiated requests and the volume of manual IR interactions by better pre-empting customer changes and responding automatically. More specifically, analytical insights extracted within the Analytics Laboratory will: Be embedded within the CTS architecture to influence the automatic detection of customer events and upcoming changes in their circumstance and ultimately trigger the relevant services on their behalf. Be embedded within intervention management processes to inform the design and delivery of automatic intervention and the outcome-driven routing of workflow. Learn from the actual results of automated and manual interventions, along with IR-initiated events, to adapt to changes in behaviours. Further to this, information and knowledge management processes will embed within key CTS processes to make contextual, relevant information seamlessly available to IR staff at the right-time. Adopting an agile, responsive design structure The IL architecture will support the CTS architecture’s use of consistent, repeatable design structures by delivering reusable, modular results. More specifically, analytical insights extracted within the Analytics Laboratory will: Expose and inject reliable, right-time, insights into the CTS service design framework allowing design decisions, including IR interventions, to be influenced by a rich insight into historic, current and even predicted behaviours. Enabling a wider, coordinated ecosystem of service delivery The IL architecture will support delivery of key services through its business partner network by improving the certainty of service results and enabling the necessary cross-organisation data governance processes. More specifically, analytical insights extracted within the Analytics Laboratory will: Embed consistently into services to improve the accuracy and transparency of responses delivered to customers by service partners, on behalf of IR. Provide deeper understanding into how customers want to interact with IR to guide the identification and development of new and alternative business partners. Learn from results and behaviour differences across the ecosystem of service delivery, to support continuous delivery improvement. Table 1. Enabling Intelligence within the CTS architecture IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 23 of 109 1.1.6.2 Supporting the Customer Experience (CX) Business Solution Architecture The following table will provide a high-level overview of how the IL architecture will support the key characteristics of the CX architecture 9 . Please refer to the deliverable D008-HD Business Solution Blueprint for Customer Experience for more details on the CX architecture. Providing greater access, availability and pervasiveness of self- management The IL architecture will provide crucial support for IR’s delivery of self- management options by improving the ability to understand, validate and direct customers across the Omni-channel experience. More specifically, analytical insights extracted within the Analytics Laboratory will: Embed insights into customer-centric behaviours within the CX architecture to guide the design and delivery of outcome-specific, self-management services. Inform design of channel-specific services and customer interactions to support an increased uptake in self-management options. Provide the CX architecture with accurate, right-time insights into customer understanding at each self-management interaction point, allowing for a more relevant customer experience. Learn from the actual results of self-management options, to adapt to changes in customer experience and overall compliance. Tailoring and personalising services and channels The IL architecture will supply actionable insights into customers, services and channels to support an experience that is specifically tailored to suit their needs. More specifically, analytical insights extracted within the Analytics Laboratory will: Provide the CX architecture with insightful, granular ways to group customers according to similar service needs, based on a deep insight into such traits as behaviours, compliance risk, norms and interaction patterns; which can be applied to tailor and personalise services based on customer needs and desired outcomes. Provide the CX architecture with insights into channel usage patterns and a deeper understanding how behavioural shifts and patterns should guide the Omni-channel experience. Learn from the actual results of tailored interactions, to adapt to changes in behaviours, preferences and diversification. 9 The Analytics Factory, as described in Appendix E of this document, represents the conceptual part of the business solution architecture in which insights emerging from the Analytics Laboratory will embed and execute. For clarity, the CX architecture is specifically referenced here as the part of the Analytics Factory supported by the IL architecture. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 24 of 109 Embedding a customer centric emphasis in design and delivery The IL architecture will provide insight into the voice of the customer and an understanding of their needs to support a customer-centric approach to designing and refining channels and interactions. More specifically, analytical insights extracted within the Analytics Laboratory will: Inject deep understanding (such as motivations, circumstances and underlying root causes) behind the behaviours that IR will try to influence, into the communication design process. This will help the CX architecture target messaging in direct support of intended outcomes and aid with measurement of results. Support the design and delivery of proactive identification and response to life events, according to the most likely customer preferences and according to their diverse needs. Influence design of future state customer services and channels, allowing for a data-driven approach to continuous, responsive improvement of services based on actual results and insights from co-design initiatives. Enabling greater outreach, communication and collaboration The IL architecture will support the move towards a greater use of targeted and effective communication for the purposes of educating, influencing and informing customers. More specifically, analytical insights extracted within the Analytics Laboratory will: Support insight-driven customisation of appropriate messaging to suit IR’s overall objectives. Provide insight into the most effective, convenient delivery mechanism for communication and campaigns, including a rich adaption to device preferences and usage patterns. Learn from the actual results of targeted messages and campaigns, to adapt to changes in behaviours, preferences and compliance patterns. Extending the digital border and use of business partners The IL architecture will support an Intelligence Led approach towards managing interactions through and with business partners, helping IR to reduce the burden and cost of compliance for its customers whilst increasing the convenience of service delivery. More specifically, analytical insights extracted within the Analytics Laboratory will: Provide customer and channel specific insights to guide potential opportunities for improving service delivery and design innovation with business partners and intermediaries. These data-driven insights into likely customer behaviours, preferences, motivations and responses to change. Table 2. Enabling Intelligence within the CX architecture IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 25 of 109 1.1.6.3 Supporting the Enterprise Support Services (ESS) Business Solution Architecture As the Enterprise Support Services (ESS) Business Solution Blueprint is currently under development and running to a slightly later timeframe than this document, a high-level overview of how the IL architecture will support the key characteristics of the ESS architecture is not provided in this version of this document. A key design decision (KDD #200) seeking endorsement of the breadth of ESS capabilities that would be candidates for becoming Intelligence Led has been reviewed and confirmed by the DIF and endorsed by the ESS BOF but has not been approved by the Business Process Design Council (BPDC). The BPDC has requested the ESS BOF reconsider the KDD, a process that is underway. 1.1.7 Overview of the Impact on IR’s Customers, Business Partners and Staff Shifting from the current state to the future state will have impacts on IR’s customers, business partners and IR staff. An early view and summary of impacts from the Intelligence Led Business Process Architecture include the following. Customers / Business Partners Increased use and dependence on business partners (for example accounting and payroll software developers) will mean they will need to ensure that their business rules and software versions for customers are up to date and to be able to adapt rapidly to changing needs. Shape and number of business partners will increase and their relationship with IR will change (technology, contractual - including IR business partner management, collaboration in continuous improvement and co-design focus). Business partner information providers (for example banks and government agencies) will want assurance that their data is supported by frameworks, standards and secure systems and processes. Customer experience improves as IR understands customer circumstances and tailors more relevant and targeted customer interactions. Less functional customer contact required as IR will identify and automate customer interactions such as enrolments and registrations. Customers may still be required to validate information gathered from business partners but this will be offset by reduced data entry, improved transparency and greater certainty. IR Staff More capacity and capability required to establish strong data governance standards, validation, infrastructure and re-useable frameworks. Shift in capability to establish, manage and maintain complex relationships with data providers and agencies. Less manual extraction and checking of data as a result of new technologies and real time validation. Highly specialised analytical skills and experience will be required to build frameworks and models using sophisticated techniques and tools with customer information and data sets. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 26 of 109 New ways of working will require a wider cross-section of staff to have the capabilities to rapidly adopt, access and use analytical tools, technologies, data and models. These tools will enable staff to assess customer information, insights and customer compliance behaviour to determine the next customer interaction. Further information on impacts is documented within business processes in Section 4 of this document and a consolidated view can be found in Appendix C. A comprehensive organisational impact assessment (customers and IR staff) deliverable will be completed in October 2015 by the Organisational Change Management team, following the COTS decision and finalisation of the Programme Delivery Plan for Stages 1 to 4.

1 Classified In Confidence: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Business Transformation Programme Technology & Enterprise Integration Blueprint Executive Summary Version 1.00 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 2 Technology & Enterprise Integration Blueprint Blueprint Context Co-existence •The Technology and Enterprise Integration section of the Blueprint contains the high-level design of the Application Architecture, Integration Architecture, Technical Architecture and Security Architecture associated with the Business Transformation Programme. •This blueprint is one chapter in the overall Business Transformation high level design blueprint. •The blueprint outlines the technology components required to support the direction in the business blueprints. •The Analytics, Data Warehouse, Reporting and Enterprise Content Management logical architecture will be addressed in the design phase. •Key Design Decisions that inform the blueprint content will be revisited in detailed design to assess cost benefit and impact of the chosen core tax system. •The Technology Change and Operations blueprint will outline the process, governance and organisational elements of Technology. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 3 Technology & Enterprise Integration Blueprint Approach to Content Development The Technology and Enterprise Integration blueprint content will be developed by capability domains, each capability domain will be documented as a section in the blueprint. The diagram below illustrates the approach to developing the Technology & Enterprise Integration Technology Blueprint. For each capability domain a reference architecture assessment will be performed to identify the future state technology capability, this will take input from current IR reference models and \[Information redacted\] Reference Architectures for each capability domain. The capability domain assessments and directions then form the content for the Technology & Enterprise Integration Blueprint. In addition, the development of this Blueprint is aligned with the following principles: •The existing IR Reference Architectures are not to be replaced by this Blueprint. It is, however, possible that the outcome of the Blueprint will trigger updates to those architectures, adjusting them to Programme’s needs. Any changes to approved reference architectures will be called out as separate decisions and will be submitted to the Technical Architecture Design Council (TADC) for approval •The recommendations contained in this Blueprint are aligned with the IR Enterprise Architecture (EA) and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Principles •Future state recommendations have looked to adopt “as a Service” solutions and the utilisation of the available “All of Government (AoG)” services where appropriate.

DIF Organisation Design Council BT PMO IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 7 of 14 1 Executive Summary IR for the Future (IR4TF) will require a significant enhancement to IR digital channel and intelligence capabilities to enable the customer to engage using a channel of their choice in the easiest way possible. While the current Information and Communications Technology (ICT) systems and teams have served IR /well for the past 25 years, the needs of IR’s stakeholders have changed and IR has built a compelling case for change that will deliver substantial benefits. It is important that we adopt modern technologies and work practices to deliver the future capabilities. However, we must also preserve the current systems and capabilities whilst they are required, proactively manage co-existence with the new systems and manage our change risk. To address the adoption required above a new ICT Target Operating Model, based on the COBIT framework, will be implemented. Also developed as part of this document is a new ICT sourcing strategy, together with a decision framework, that will identify how ICT will apply the required capabilities of the new model. ICT’s current Change, Improve, Run model places focus on building and running bespoke mainframe solutions. This sees heavy reliance on internal delivery for application development and operations. The new ICT operating model is focussed on how ICT serves their customers (internal and external) and will be based on core capabilities of ‘Advise and Plan’, ‘Design and Acquire’, and ‘Operate’ and underpinned by ‘Shared Capabilities’. This operating model, along with the new sourcing strategy and decision framework (see Section Error! Reference source not found.), will see focus shift to keeping strategy, governance, design and service/vendor management provided by IR resources. It will also provide a framework to identify candidates for those commodity services that can be more readily provided by a well-managed vendor community, subject to these services being fit for purpose, cost effectively and able to be provided in a timely manner. As the New Zealand Government’s primary source of income, tax and entitlements, services must not be disrupted by this transition from current to future processes and systems. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 8 of 14 The following shows the transition of how we manage our ICT environment. This Blueprint defines a new ICT Target Operating Model and capabilities that will deliver the future state. 1.1 TC&O Blueprint Context and Work plan The TC&O Blueprint is being developed in two phases: Version 1.0 (July 2015) - Defines the end state ICT Target Operating Model and required ICT capabilities (this Blueprint version). Version 2.0 (December 2015) – Will define the interim states through BT Stages 1-4, the ICT capability uplifts and key initiatives to implement the ICT Target Operating Model and the organisation functional design. The ICT Target Operating Model and capabilities defined in this Blueprint have taken input from a number of sources to ensure alignment with other areas in IR, addresses current issues (where appropriate), uses best practice, has relevance to IR and is future focused. The inputs include: BT documents - including IR TOM, business case, other Blueprints and Key Design Decisions ICT Strategy and previous ICT assessments - ICT Strategic Plan and assessments of capability, processes, maturity and requirements Current state ICT Operating Model and pain points Industry frameworks and best practice – detailed review and assessment of ICT frameworks and best practice to adopt the most appropriate and relevant to IR. Apply the frameworks to ensure alignment and coverage of the end to end ICT Target Operating Model. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 9 of 14 The diagram below shows the case for change, inputs used and how they were collated. Figure 1 – TC&O Blueprint context and work plan 1.2 New ICT Target Operating Model Objectives Customer experienced focused with seamless business and ICT capability IR for the future will be “digital first” and “intelligence-led”, both of which will be enabled to a large extent by ICT capability. The ICT Target Operating Model will ensure ICT is an active partner in business service design and strategy. Customer engagement is a key focus of the new ICT Operating Model. The Business Transformation Customer Engagement value chains help drive the design of the ICT Target Operating Model. At every stage in the customer engagement lifecycle the ICT Target Operating Model has interlocking services that will supply the right capability at the right time. The ICT Target Operating Model will provide an integrated approach to planning and change processes, allowing cross-business teams to collaborate on customer centric outcomes without compromising the need for safe and secure ICT operations. Consistent, safe and secure operations IR provides most of the revenue that government needs to fund its programmes. In addition IR collects and distributes social support programme payments enabling people to participate in society and provides the government with policy advice. The ICT Target Operating Model, organisation and New Service Platform will improve IR’s consistent, safe and secure delivery of ICT operations to ensure IR’s critical services are available and able to be changed when required.

End-to-End (E2E) business outcome focused ICT ICT will be more business outcome focused through its culture, processes and systems. Measures of performance and success will be business-aligned and both ICT and the business will share a common understanding of the required outcomes that deliver value to our customers and stakeholders. ICT will engage and integrate with key business strategy, planning and investment processes to ensure upfront alignment and understanding. ICT will be IR’s internal solution integrator for creating new ICT capability to deliver agreed business outcomes. Delivering better ICT, faster ICT is central to achieving the IR goal of a faster, more agile organisation. In order to deliver faster change we are simplifying the ICT landscape, improving our integration capabilities, consolidating applications where appropriate and designing new working practices. The technology and applications that make up the new core ICT platform will be capable of being configured and changed quickly and the ICT Target Operating Model will ensure IR effectively and efficiently leverages that capability. To capture the value of digital technology, an innovative service design and delivery approach will be adopted. In addition to the traditional “waterfall” delivery method, a more agile, iterative method will be used to deliver faster, more flexible ICT capability. 1.3 Key changes to the ICT Operating Model A multi-modal operating model IR ICT must be able to operate in a more complex environment due to Business Transformation with the following objectives: 1. a continuing requirement to operate the existing systems without failure or service degradation until they are no longer required 2. a requirement to implement the New Services Platform (NSP), using new iterative design methodologies and operate it at the required levels of service from day one for Core Stage 1 3. a requirement to ensure the co-existence of the current (Heritage) and the new systems during the transition between them, and 4. a requirement to implement foundational capabilities, new digital platforms and the associated people / process changes to deliver on IR’s digital-first future vision. The ICT Target Operating Model will have an enhanced ability to deliver different speeds of change dependent on the systems and risk profile involved in the change. This will be done through “method adaptation” where pre-defined, different length paths for each mode of operation are chosen through the Solution Delivery Life Cycle (SDLC) and ICT IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 11 of 14 governance frameworks at the time of project initiation. This proven model (Information redacted) of multi-modal operation will be elaborated in Version 2 of this blueprint. Thi s chang e is key to delivering both th e “Delivering bette r ICT , faster “ and “Consistent, safe and secure operations” IC T Targe t Operating Model objectives. Manage outcomes and integ rate services IC T wil l manage servi ce outcomes, wit h heav y preference towards aggregation an d integration of servic es rath er tha n building and operating IT components. Cl ear alignment to international be st practice ICT and Project Management frameworks \[Information redacted\] This change is key to achieving and continuing the “Delivering better ICT, faster“, “E2E business outcome focused ICT” and “Seamless business and ICT capability” ICT Target Operating Model objectives. Significant proactive engagement in business strategy and planning processes By acknowledging the need to align the IR ICT Target Operating Model with international frameworks, a subsequent impact is the increased amount of business and IT engagement they require. \[Information redacted\] specifically calls out the necessity for significant levels of ICT engagement in the business strategy and financial planning processes. The point of these engagements in the formative business processes is: To understand clearly the business outcomes and ensure ICT performance measures align with targeted benefits To ensure that ICT innovation and technology advances are leveraged into strategy and business planning so as to make best use of those opportunities KDD#227 Recognition and adoption of global methodologies in IR - \[Information redacted\] as a reference framework The KDD has been endorsed by IS-BOF (19/06/15) and TADC (10/07/15) for IR’s adoption of \[Information redacted\] as a reference framework for end to end best practice ICT Operating Model for IR. KDD#258 Recognition and adoption of global methodologies in IR. The KDD has been endorsed by F-DIF (14/07/15) and IS-BOF (31/07/15) for IR’s adoption of key global methodologies as reference frameworks for th e establishment of IR’ s ICT TOM. These are to guide IT service management, project management and security to visibly sanction their widespread use and to more quickly deliver a detailed, durable, end-to-end best practice ICT Operating Model for IR. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 12 of 14 To provide insight into the impacts on ICT of certain strategy and financial planning ideas before they are committed to. This increased level of collaboration will need to be discussed and agreed with the relevant IR Stakeholders to agree the approach, engagement points and processes. This will be completed within Version 2 of this Blueprint. Implementation of a new ICT Sourcing Strategy The ICT sourcing model supports the ICT Target Operating Model by providing the strategy for obtaining the required ICT capabilities. •Inland Revenue’s ICT strategy has the overarching principle that IR will obtain required capabilities on the basis of rent or buy before build. •Further, ICT technology and associated services will be sourced on an “as-a-service” basis from external providers as the preferred sourcing approach where the services are fit for purpose, cost effective, of the required maturity, supported by suitable SLA’s, and have the governance and design authority services to ensure that they meet stakeholder requirements. •The strategy for sourcing external capability will move to a preferred model where ICT services are contracted on an outcome basis, rather than Inland Revenue buying service inputs and acting as an aggregator of external and internal inputs. When considering the sourcing strategy, maintaining Inland Revenue’s core IP and knowledge is a key determining factor in determining which capabilities should be retained internally and which could be sourced externally. Inland Revenue’s strategy, as defined in ICT Strategy & Roadmaps (2014), is to only retain capabilities that have knowledge (intellectual property) that is important or unique to Inland Revenue. 1.4 Immediate action With the ICT Target Operating Model now defined and an understanding of the current state, pain points and required future features known, IR will establish capability that will enable the new ICT Target Operating Model across three areas: Evolve the BT Method to create our required Design and Acquire capabilities oWith support from FAST, IR will define an end- to-end agile delivery capability oIR will ensure the BT Method and supporting capabilities enable Multi-Modal delivery and the capabilities to manage system integration across both the BT Programme and Heritage areas oIR will define the complete suite of processes, roles and responsibilities and required tooling and support the required change management and training needs oThis activity will be owned by BT in consultation with the impacted pan IR teams and delivered to support the programmes critical path Initiate the NSP Operate detailed design phase in parallel and in conjunction with the TC&O Blueprint Version 2 work IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Page 13 of 14 oWithin the next six months IR will define, acquire and have ready non- production environments for the CORE Stage 1 programme oThe NSP Operate function will be capable of supporting “Service Transition” activities in 2016 and production support for Core Stage 1 targets at their go- live date oA detailed design phase will produce the capability creation plan for people, processes and tools and will deliver a detailed implementation plan oThis work will occur between August-November 2015 and will be managed by the NSP Director. Complete the TC&O Blueprint Version 2 scope which includes the interim organisational deployment of the ICT functions to enable the four release Stages of transformation oAlign with the ESS Blueprint - A number of the capability improvements cannot be turned into initiatives without engagement and support within the ESS Blueprint team Examples include Finance and HR capability uplift. Engagement and agreement with the ESS team on how to progress will be required and should be managed as part of the V2 scope oAlign with the Organisation Design Stream - These activities will need to occur in alignment with the Organisation Design approach and will be led by the TC&O Blueprint business owner oThis work will occur between August-December 2015 and will be managed by the NSP Director. The timing noted for the implementation of these initiatives recognises that some are essential foundation enabling capabilities required to support the NSP. The next version of this Blueprint will bring more detail to the capability initiatives, implementation plan, interim states and interim ICT functional deployment.

Inland Revenue’s ability to continue collecting tax and disburse entitlements is increasingly constrained by problems with its current operating model 1 . The current model is based on processes designed specifically for tax collection and disbursement. These processes are intimately embedded in the design of the FIRST computer system. Neither the processes nor FIRST were designed for social policy or for today’s digital world. In addition, the organisational culture is oriented toward business processes rather than toward providing customer-centric services. System complexity has increased dramatically to accommodate Inland Revenue’s expanded role in the administration of social policy. The technology platform (FIRST) now has approximately 40 million lines of highly intertwined software code, which means it is expensive and time-consuming to adapt the system to new customer requirements, such as smartphone access. For example, the recent GST rate change required changes to a large number of systems and documents, raising a significant risk of error or system failure. Also, approximately half of our 1100 data entry processing staff are engaged full-time on correcting data entries. System improvements could eliminate much of this rework, but because of the system’s extraordinary complexity, it is difficult and expensive to solve this problem. IR’s Business Transformation Programme has identified the following core problems: A proposed new operating model (the “Target Operating Model”) would overcome the limitations of the current operating model and future-proof Inland Revenue’s ability to continue to achieve its strategic priorities. 1 The operating model is a comprehensive description of Inland Revenue’s operations, including people, capabilities, processes, systems, and technology. •We are unable to satisfy the changing expectations of our customers. •We are unable to rapidly and economically respond to government policy changes including Better Public Services. •We face an increasing risk of a systems failure that would severely damage our ability to collect and disburse money. •We face an increasing risk of deteriorating organisational performance. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Inland Revenue 5 Strategic Assessment - The Case for Change Proposal This Strategic Assessment outlines the case for a progressive transition from Inland Revenue’s current operating model toward a new business-led and digitally enabled operating model, known as the “Target Operating Model”, delivering the capability Inland Revenue needs to continue to effectively run its business. The changes required to implement the Target Operating Model require a major change from Inland Revenue’s current business model. The Target Operating Model would be progressively phased in over a period of approximately ten years. It would establish a sustainable model for the future. The Target Operating Model would incorporate a proactive, agile, performance-oriented, collaborative corporate culture; revised organisational capabilities; and customer-centric, digital technology-enabled business processes supported by a modular, scalable, technology platform along with the appropriate supporting policy. The Target Operating Model will eliminate constraints associated with the complexity and age of Inland Revenue’s current model, which was based on business processes designed for tax collection, and technology that went live between December 1991 and March 1992. It would maintain and improve Inland Revenue’s ability to perform its core roles of collecting tax and disbursing social entitlements such as child support, to support government’s fiscal, economic, and social outcomes. The Target Operating Model will have the following characteristics: •Customer-centric culture and capabilities. •Modern, fit for purpose business systems and processes that support our role as a tax administrator and our expanding role in the delivery of social policies. •Business systems and processes that allow policy changes to be made in a timely and cost-efficient way. •Business systems and processes that can integrate with other public service systems and channels to achieve a customer-centric service experience at a lower cost for government and customers. •Systems and processes that make it easier for citizens and businesses to meet their obligations, such as near real-time transaction processing, where appropriate. •Business systems and processes that make it more difficult for citizens and businesses to evade their obligations, for example, by facilitating collection of more obligations at source. •Scalable systems and processes that could allow us to deliver other public services to leverage Inland Revenue’s core competencies in the collection and disbursement of money. For example, collecting debt on behalf of other agencies. •Modular systems and processes that can economically and rapidly adapt to new customer expectations or government policies. •Integrated service delivery with other public services that deliver our contribution to results 9 (one stop online shop for all government advice and IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Inland Revenue 6 Strategic Assessment - The Case for Change support to businesses), 10 (New Zealanders can complete their transactions with government easily in a digital environment), and 7 (to reduce the rates of total crime, violent crime and youth crime). Benefits Migrating toward the proposed Target Operating Model would lead to the following benefits: •Enable Inland Revenue to more easily and quickly implement changes required by government to achieve their fiscal, social and economic outcomes. •Reduce compliance costs for businesses and individuals. •Enable Inland Revenue to support better public services to deliver customer- centric services, such as smartphone transactions, at lower cost for the customer and government. •Improve compliance and enable Inland Revenue to collect a larger percentage of the collectable tax base. •Enable Inland Revenue to leverage our infrastructure and capabilities in the collection and disbursement of money to support government in a more effective delivery of public services. •Enable Inland Revenue to maintain and increase organisational performance. •Minimise the risk of protracted systems outages and intermittent systems failures. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Inland Revenue 7 Strategic Assessment - The Case for Change 2 Strateg ic Context A well-functioning tax system is critical to support a well-functioning economy and achieving Government’s fiscal, economic and social objectives. Inland Revenue is responsible for administering New Zealand’s tax system. Inland Revenue also manages or shares the administration of several social policy programmes. Inland Revenue has evolved from being a department that just collected taxes to a department that does a whole range of things (Minister of Revenue’s Introduction in IR for the Future, March 2012). The Minister of Revenue has said that Inland Revenue’s challenge now is how we make the organisation, even smarter and more responsive in the future. Inland Revenue’s strategic objectives have been defined by an analysis of the organisation’s mission, vision, and societal role, in the context of Government policies and priorities. We have identified limitations with our current operating model that will restrict our ability to fulfil these strategic objectives. In particular, any interruption of our operations puts a large part of the Crown’s revenue at risk. 2. 1 Our R ol e On behalf of the Government, Inland Revenue handles a very large volume of interaction with citizens and businesses. We collect more than 80% of core Crown Revenue. Most of this comes from income tax and GST. Inland Revenue also manages or shares the administration of: KiwiSaver, Student Loans, Child Support, Working for Families Tax Credits, and Paid Parental Leave. In 2011-2012, Inland Revenue: •Collected $XX in tax •Answered XX customer service contacts •Received XX self-help service contacts •Collected $XX in over-due debt •Identified $XX in discrepancies through audit activity •Distributed $XX in KiwiSaver funds to scheme providers •Distributed $XX in Working for Families Tax credits •Collected $XX in Child Support payments •Received $XX in Student Loan payments In line with the Government’s Policies and Priorities and our vision of being a world-class revenue organisation, recognised for service and excellence, Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Programme aims to improve the organisation’s ability to adapt to policy changes and changing customer requirements, and to improve robustness and performance, and minimise risk. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Inland Revenue 8 Strategic Assessment - The Case for Change 2.2 Strategic Map The following diagram illustrates how the proposed transformation programme links with Government priorities and Inland Revenue’s mission, outcomes, and vision. What IR ultimately exists to do We contribute to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand by collecting and distributing money. Our success is reflected through: •Revenue is available to fund government programmes through people meeting payment obligations of their own accord. •People receive payments they are entitled to, enabling them to participate in society. Inland Revenue’s Mission and Outcomes What IR needs to be so we can best deliver what NZ needs A world-class revenue organisation recognised for service and excellence. We work with customers and other organisations to make compliance easy and to give New Zealanders confidence that everyone pays and receives the right amount. To be recognised for service and excellence we aim to achieve the performance goals that define a world-class revenue organisation. These are: Speed; Certainty; Compliance; Value. Inland Revenue’s Vision What the Government has prioritised •Responsibly manage the Government’s finances •Build a more competitive and productive economy •Deliver better public services within tight financial constraints •Rebuild Canterbury Government Priorities Why we need to transform •To be a world class revenue organisation recognised for service and excellence, IR must keep up with the pace of change. •If IR does not transform, the department will be unable to continue to deliver what New Zealand needs. •Transformation will allow IR to overcome the obstacles constraining the achievement of its strategic objectives. Inland Revenue Business Transformation Programme What we want our transformation to achieve •Increase Crown revenue •Reduce Crown cost of debt •Reduce Crown expenditure •Reduce State Sector cost •Increase the ability to implement policy changes •Increase customer satisfaction and minimise compliance burden •Improve social policy outcomes Inland Revenue’s Strategic Objectives What transformation aims to achieve via our contribution to better public services Result 9: New Zealand businesses have a one-stop online shop for all government advice and support they need to run and grow their business Result 10: New Zealanders can complete their transactions with government easily in a digital environmentf Result 7: To reduce the rates of total crime, violent crime and youth crime Government Results What it is important to ensure in a transformed state In designing and delivering a future state organisation, IR will: •Enhance and sustain the integrity of the tax and social policy system •Ensure our understanding of the customer informs the design of services •Transform our ability to anticipate a changing environment and respond in a quick and agile way •Agree and adhere to an enterprise architecture for our people, process, policy and platform •Enhance the integrity of the information that we collect, hold and share with others •Develop a culture that actively achieves transformation and an agile organisation. Our values will support a culture based on clear accountability, good relationships, continuous improvement, and collaboration, so that we achieve what New Zealand needs •Ensure that working with other organisations is central to delivering better services and value for New Zealanders Inland Revenue’s Design Principles IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Inland Revenue 9 Strategic Assessment - The Case for Change 2.3 Key Stakeholders In the development of this Strategic Assessment we have engaged extensively within Inland Revenue about the case for change, and with the Ministers of Finance and Revenue. We have also engaged with the \[Information redacted\] and will maintain on- going engagement to ensure that they are informed on progress and (for the two last- mentioned) that our operating models are aligned. In addition to gaining wide support, this approach allows us to present the case for change with confidence about the risks identified with the current operating model and the strategic opportunities that exist. Inland Revenue’s senior management team is committed to the Business Transformation Programme. The Commissioner chairs the Transformation Programme Board; A Deputy Commissioner has been assigned the role of Senior Responsible Owner. We recognise our role in contributing to results 9 (one stop online shop for all government advice and support to businesses), and 10 (New Zealanders can complete their transactions with government easily in a digital environment), and 7 (to reduce the rates of total crime, violent crime and youth crime). We have engaged lead agencies about results 9 and 10. We will also engage with the \[Information redacted\] about result 7. The Business Transformation Programme maintains on-going engagement with \[Information redacted\]. The programme board includes representatives of these agencies. A stakeholder management plan is being developed to engage key stakeholders including other agencies such as the \[Information redacted\], third party intermediaries (including the accountancy profession and the IT/software industry), the tax and business community, and customers about the transformation of our operating model. This plan will identify the level of engagement appropriate to each stakeholder group. Some groups will be asked to provide direct input into the transformation programme; others will be invited to provide advice or comments; and some groups will simply be informed of progress. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Inland Revenue 10 Strategic Assessment - The Case for Change 3 The Case for Change An Investment Logic Map was developed with key stakeholders in a workshop on 16 July and is attached at Appendix 1. Several important problems with the current operating model constrain Inland Revenue’s ability to continue collecting tax and disburse entitlements. The Business Transformation Programme has identified a comprehensive strategic intervention to address these constraints. This involves an approximately ten-year transition to a new service-oriented operating model known as the “Target Operating Model.” The proposed transition represents a major transformation of Inland Revenue’s operations, including culture, capability, processes, systems, and technology. 3. 1 Prob l em s wi th E x is ti ng M od el The Target Operating Model will address the following problems: 3 . 1 . 1 C h a n g i n g E x p e c t a t i o n s o f C u s t o m e r s Globally tax and social welfare agencies operate in a rapidly changing environment. The changing nature of doing business internationally and over the Internet has changed customers’ expectations of service delivery. Technological developments in the private sector have increased service level expectations, with customers wanting a similar experience interacting with their tax agency as they do with banks, airlines and online retailers. Customers now expect to provide information once, and then act in a fast and intuitive online environment when dealing with government. Our current operating model constrains our ability to satisfy these expectations. The model is based on business processes that were designed for tax collection but not for social product delivery, and for delivery through traditional, not digital channels. The organisational culture is oriented toward business processes rather than toward providing customer-centric services. The technology platform (FIRST) is extraordinarily complex, with approximately 40 million lines of highly intertwined software code, which means it is expensive and time-consuming to adapt the system to new customer requirements, such as smartphone access. As an example, approximately half of our 1100 data entry processing staff are engaged full-time on correcting data entries. System improvements could eliminate much of this •We are unable to satisfy the changing expectations of our customers. •We are unable to rapidly and economically respond to government policy changes including Better Public Services. •We face an increasing risk of a systems failure that would severely damage our ability to collect and disburse money. •We face an increasing risk of deteriorating organisational performance. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Inland Revenue 11 Strategic Assessment - The Case for Change rework, but because of the system’s extraordinary complexity, it is difficult and expensive to solve this problem. Delivery channels, such as the call centre and website, are specifically designed around products and processes rather than customer requirements. These constraints make it very difficult to deliver a citizen-centric service that combines customer information across products to deliver a single experience through the customer’s chosen channel. They also make it difficult for Inland Revenue to integrate with other public services to achieve an all-of-government service experience, or to add new delivery channels. 3 . 1 . 2 R e s p o n d i n g t o G o v e r n m e n t N e e d s a n d E x p e c t a t i o n s It is becoming more expensive and time-consuming to implement policy changes. The technology platform is already complex, and it is becoming more complex as time goes on. Two factors constrain Inland Revenue’s ability to implement Government policy changes, if the change requires a modification of Inland Revenue’s technological platform: •The number of areas in the system that are affected by a particular change, and •The number of programmers that can work on any particular section of our systems without loss of productivity, and •The availability of software specialists qualified in the underlying software language, which is obsolescent. The growing complexity of Inland Revenue’s technology platform constrains the organisation’s ability to implement fundamental changes to tax policy or social programmes. Because the system is not modular, changing one part can affect any other part of the system. Each new policy or programme further increases the system’s complexity. Changing such a complex system is costly, time-consuming, and risky. These constraints also undermine our ability to make operational changes. Operational changes are required to respond to our day to day demands, and adjust policy settings in line with government requirements. For example, the recent change of GST rate, from 12.5% to 15%, required changes in a large number of peripheral systems and documents including forms, brochures, letters, and web pages. The system’s complexity makes it difficult to co-ordinate all these individual changes, and opens the possibility of errors that could bring down the system. Also, because of the system’s complexity, implementing such a simple change involves a significant amount of work. Delivering Inland Revenue’s contribution to results 9 (one stop online shop for all government advice and support to businesses), 10 (New Zealanders can complete their transactions with government easily in a digital environment), and 7 (to reduce the rates of total crime, violent crime and youth crime), is particularly challenging (and perhaps even impossible) without significant changes to Inland Revenue’s business systems and processes. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Inland Revenue 12 Strategic Assessment - The Case for Change 3.1.3 Risk of Systems Failure The age and complexity of Inland Revenue’s technological platform lead to a risk of serious system failure. Inland Revenue’s primary technology platform, FIRST, went live 1991-1992. Over the past twenty years, other systems to support our social products have been added and upgraded. Inland Revenue’s technological platform now includes the FIRST mainframe system, along with a range of satellite systems. As the system has evolved, it has become extraordinarily complex. Inland Revenue’s FIRST system, originally intended for the efficient administration of tax, has over recent years, also been used to administer a great many non-tax programmes such as student loans, Child Support and KiwiSaver. This has resulted in greater systems complexity, loss of agility and efficiency, and increased administration costs. (Minister of Revenue’s Speech to Tax Agents’ Institute of New Zealand, 9 March 2012.) Several reviews of Inland Revenue’s systems have been undertaken recently. These reviews reached the following conclusions (among others): •As major legislative changes continue to be made, complexity within our technology platforms increase. The result is that the system’s ability to continue to respond to major policy changes and the changing business needs is declining while the cost of system support and maintenance is growing. •Demand for new customer channels (Internet, smartphone) is growing, together with a desire to move to near real time transactions. The complexity and highly intertwined nature of FIRST’s core mainframe design makes it increasingly difficult for Inland Revenue to respond to these changing needs, including changes to support the Government’s more collaborative cross-government approach. •It is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit appropriately skilled staff, and access to knowledge to resolve system problems, because of the age of our systems and in particular, the underlying, now outdated, technology. This particularly affects the core mainframe system (FIRST), because appropriately qualified specialists are approaching retirement. Students at New Zealand tertiary institutions apparently see no future in studying the relevant technical material. External expert advice confirms that migrating to a new platform will take approximately eight to ten years. If we do not begin the transition soon, the growing complexity of our Inland Revenue’s situation has some similarities with that of the Royal Bank of Scotland in June 2012. A system failure in late June 2012 left millions of Royal Bank of Scotland customers unable to access their accounts over the weekend. Although the problem was corrected within a few days, several thousand customers were still reporting problems a month later. Some customers said they were keeping their accounts open only in the hope of receiving compensation. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Inland Revenue 13 Strategic Assessment - The Case for Change systems coupled with the increased demand over this period will place an unsustainable load on our systems. At some point we will pass a threshold where we will lose confidence in the on-going stability of our platform. The prospect of intermittent system failures becomes a real possibility. We already experience periodic system outages. However, we expect these to be more frequent in the future causing disruptions to service delivery. Of more concern is the prospect of protracted systems outages or a catastrophic system failure. In this event we will have limited capability to be able to deliver our core functions of collecting tax and disbursing entitlements, leading to (among other things) unexpected “dips” in revenue, and people not receiving their entitlements. Over time, negative customer experiences caused by system outages and failures may impact customer behaviour, leading to normally compliant customers becoming non- compliant and reinforcing the behaviour of non-compliant customers. This leads to a reputational risk for Inland Revenue. 3 . 1 . 4 R i s k o f P e r f o r m a n c e D e t e r i o r a t i o n Some key indicators are already under pressure, and are likely to progressively deteriorate without significant investment that addresses our system and process weaknesses and risks. In particular, the timeliness of customer payment and return filing has been gradually but consistently declining for several years. This trend predates the 2008 economic downturn. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Inland Revenue 14 Strategic Assessment - The Case for Change Inland Revenue has put in place a range of interventions including system/ process improvement initiatives to enhance the performance in this and other areas of compliance. At best, these have reduced the rate of decline. The historical evidence suggests that a step change is required to get significant lift in our effectiveness in the future, as well as to prevent the anticipated decline of the same over time. Evidence from some of our other measures corroborates this. Measures of the ease with which customers are able to self-manage their tax affairs are especially sensitive to IR interventions and the indicators looking at the impact made in these areas are therefore also an indirect measure of how fit-for-purpose our systems and processes are. The two relevant indicators show respectively a downward and static trend, despite IR’s sustained investment in improving the current systems and processes. The proportion of customers who are aware of aware of their obligations and entitlements is trending downwards (albeit slowly), while the percentage of customers who find it easy to comply is static as shown in the two diagrams below. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Inland Revenue 15 Strategic Assessment - The Case for Change Maintaining or improving organisational performance will require either an increase in baseline funding for additional resources to improve performance, or allocation of funding to transform the way we deliver our business to ensure a sustainable increase in our performance across all areas. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 3.2 Strategic Intervention The Service Logi c & Investment Prioritisation (SLIP) process identified the need to migrate toward a new operating model , known as the “Target Operating Model ”. This model would overcome limitations with the current model and establish a sustainable model for the future. The changes required to implement the Target Operating Model require a major change from Inland Revenue’s current busines s model. The Target Operating Model i s a comprehensive description of how Inland Revenue will operate in the future. The work environment will be proactive, agile , and performance-oriented. It will value and encourage internal and external collaboration. The new model represents a major change from the current operating model. It will demand new organisational capabilities. Business processes in the Target Operating Model will be focussed on the need s of citizens, businesses, and government, and they will integrate seamlessly with digital communication channels. The Target Operating Model demands a new technology platform. This will consist of discrete, independent, modules, so that any module can be modified without affecting other parts of the system. It will be scalable, so that it can be easil y expanded to support new products. Changes to government policy may be required to support Inland Revenue's migration from the current model to the Target Operating Model. The scalable and modular nature of the proposed model allows for a phased transition away from the current model. The new model would be phased in by prioritising most- needed business capabilities and processes, according to Government and organisational priorities. Modules that support the highest priority processes would be implemented first. The prioritisation would be based on risks and opportunities, and associated costs and benefits. The Target Operating Model will have the following characteristics: •Customer-centric culture and capabilities. •Modern, fit for purpose business systems and processes that support our role as a tax administrator and our expanding role in the delivery of social policies. •Business systems and processes that allow policy changes to be made in a timely and cost-efficient way. •Business systems and processes that can integrate with other public service systems and channels to achieve a customer-centric service experience at a lower cost for government and customers. •Systems and processes that make it easier for citizens and businesses to meet their obligations, such as near real-time transaction processing, where appropriate. •Business systems and processes that make it more difficult for citizens and businesses to evade their obligations, for example, by facilitating collection of more obligations at source. •Scalable systems and processes that could allow us to deliver other public services to leverage Inland Revenue’s core competencies in the collection and IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Inland Revenue 17 Strategic Assessment - The Case for Change disbursement of money. For example, collecting debt on behalf of other agencies. •Modular systems and processes that can economically and rapidly adapt to new customer expectations or government policies. •Integrated service delivery with other public services that deliver our contribution to results 9 (one stop online shop for all government advice and support to businesses), 10 (New Zealanders can complete their transactions with government easily in a digital environment), and 7 (to reduce the rates of total crime, violent crime and youth crime) 3. 3 Ben ef it s Implementing the proposed new operating model would: •Enable Inland Revenue to more easily and quickly implement changes required by government to achieve their fiscal, social and economic outcomes. •Reduce compliance costs for businesses and individuals. •Enable Inland Revenue to support better public services to deliver customer- centric services, such as smartphone transactions, at lower cost for the customer and government. •Improve compliance and enable Inland Revenue to collect a larger percentage of the collectable tax base. •Enable Inland Revenue to leverage our infrastructure and capabilities in the collection and disbursement of money to support government in a more effective delivery of public services. •Enable Inland Revenue to improve organisational performance. •Minimise the risk of protracted systems outages and intermittent systems failures. •Make it easier for people to meet their obligations, and harder for them not to.

Version 2 has been available since April 2020 and provides more Employee Information (EI) and Employee Detail information than the current version 1. We have been working closely with payroll software developers to help ensure they build Version 2 into their systems in good time. If you file onscreen through myIR or paper, there is no change as the version 2 changes have been in place since April 2020. If you use a Payroll Bureau or Intermediary service there will likely be no impact as your payroll service provider will make any necessary changes. If you file through software, you should notice little change. If you have your own inhouse systems, you will need to build version 2 into your system before April this year. It’s important to note that amendments to EI will have to be made using the same version as the original file. For example, if you file through version 1 you must amend through version 1. If you file through software, please contact your payroll software provider if you want to know more about what will be changing and when. Key services unavailable late February From 5pm Friday 26 February to Monday 1 March, myIR and SPK2IR will be unavailable and our phone lines will be closed for planned system changes. Customers using software will also be affected. Bill payments can still be made during this time.

Are your contracts up to date? (On behalf of Employment New Zealand) Following the recent minimum wage increase, now is the ideal time for you to ensure your business's employment agreements (contracts) are up to date. You can use this as an opportunity to ensure you are meeting your legal obligations and build stronger staff relationships. Also, consider potential impacts of the minimum wage increase on internal wage relativity, external benchmarking and staff current and future pay expectations. By law every employee must have a current written employment contract. It must state the wage rate or salary payable, which must be equal or more than the relevant minimum wage. With any changes of wages, the employer must send a contract variation letter advising of the new wage. Negotiated and used fairly such contracts can be a great foundation for win/win, productive employment relationships with your staff. Employment New Zealand's Employment Agreement Builder tool can help you easily create new contracts. It covers what you must do by law, and also sets out common mistakes and how to avoid them. The tool notes three types of clauses: "Mandatory", "Recommended" and "Optional". We estimate it has been used for 950,000 contracts since it was launched five years ago. On April 1, the adult minimum wage increased from $18.90 to $20.00 gross per hour, and the starting-out and training minimum wage increased from $15.12 to $16.00 gross per hour. For more information on contracts go to employment.govt.nz - use search word "employment agreements".
