The Intergovernmental Agreement ("IGA") between the United States of America ("U.S.") and New Zealand ("NZ") to improve international tax compliance and to implement FATCA was signed on 12 June 2014. The domestic legislation required to give effect in New Zealand to FATCA reporting received Royal Assent on 30 June 2014 and the IGA and the associated domestic legislation have effect from 1 July 2014. The IGA has been brought into effect by Order in Council and came into force on 3 July 2014. 2. The following guidance is provided by the Inland Revenue to Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions ("Reporting NZFIs") 1 to assist them in understanding their obligations to identity and report on U.S. Reportable Accounts - as part of their due diligence requirements under the IGA. 3. Article 2 of the IGA requires the NZ Inland Revenue to annually and automatically exchange with the U.S. the information specified in Article 2(2) relating to U.S. Reportable Accounts. Concurrently, a Reporting NZFI will be treated by the U.S. as complying with FATCA, where, amongst other things, 2 in terms of Article 4(1)(a) of the IGA, it identifies U.S. Reportable Accounts that it maintains and reports on them annually to the NZ Inland Revenue, to enable the NZ Inland Revenue to meet its exchange of information obligations under Article 2 of the IGA. 4. These guidance notes contain a number of examples elaborating on the obligations that Reporting NZFIs have to identify and report on such accounts. These examples are set out in U.S. dollars. This is because the relevant thresholds in the IGA are set out in U.S. dollars. The IGA contains a "currency translation rule" (see Annex I VI C(4) of the IGA). This rule provides that for the purposes of determining the balance or value of financial accounts denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, a Reporting NZFI must convert the U.S. dollar threshold amounts described in Annex I into such currency using a published spot rate determined as of the last day of the calendar year preceding the year in which the Reporting NZFI is determining the balance or value. 3 What is a U.S. Reportable Account? 4 5. A "U.S. Reportable Account" is defined in the IGA to mean a financial account: • maintained by a Reporting NZFI; and • held by one or more Specified U.S. persons; or • held by a Non-U.S. entity 5 with one or more controlling persons that is a Specified U.S. person. 6. The following elements of the definition of the U.S. Reportable Account are discussed in more detail below: "financial account", "financial account maintained by a Reporting NZFI", and "financial account held by one or more Specified U.S. persons or by a Non- U.S. entity with one or more controlling persons that is a Specified U.S. person." What is a financial account? 7. The first key element of the definition of "U.S. Reportable Account" is that the account is a "financial account". The term financial account is broadly defined and may include products or obligations that would not normally be regarded as a financial account in ordinary commercial terms e.g. an equity interest in an investment entity or a cash value insurance contract. 8. When applying the definition of "financial account" in the IGA a Reporting NZFI will need to consider accounts which are excluded from this definition (discussed below), and, therefore, cannot be U.S. Reportable Accounts. A Reporting NZFI will not be required to report on these accounts to the Inland Revenue. 9. There are also various "balance or value" threshold exemptions in the IGA (see Inland Revenue's "due diligence" guidance notes) that mean that a Reporting NZFI will not be required (or indeed able) 6 to report certain accounts (i.e. accounts with a balance or value that is below the relevant threshold) as being a U.S. Reportable Account. 1 Non-reporting NZFIs (for example, sponsored investment entities and controlled foreign corporations and financial institutions with a local client base coming within Annex II of the IGA) can also have some limited FATCA due diligence obligations. To the extent that these guidance notes refer to a Reporting NZFI's due diligence obligations these references should also be read as applying to such Non-reporting NZFIs that have these obligations. The distinction between Reporting NZFIs and Non-Reporting NZFIs is outlined in detail in Inland Revenue's "registration" guidance notes. 2 Reporting NZFIs will also have other FATCA obligations (including needing to report on payments that they make to non-participating financial institutions) pursuant to Article 4 of the IGA. This is explained in more detail in Inland Revenue's "due diligence" guidance notes. 3 Inland Revenue's web-site sets out how such currency conversion can occur (See http://www.ird.govt.nz/how-to/overseas-currency/). 4 A Reporting NZFI will not need to identify and report an account as a "U.S. Reportable Account" if the account is exempted by balance or value threshold in the IGA, not identified as a "U.S. Reportable Account" after applying the due diligence procedures in Annex I of the IGA (unless there is a change in circumstance, or balance or value that means that further due diligence needs to be carried out and the account is then identified as being a U.S. Reportable Account), or the account is an excluded account (discussed below). 5 However, as outlined below, Reporting NZFIs will only need to report on Non-U.S. entity financial accounts (that are not exempted or excluded) as being U.S. Reportable accounts if the accounts are held by passive NFFEs with one or more controlling persons that are Specified U.S. Persons. A New Zealand trust which is not a financial institution is an example of an entity which could be a passive NFFE (where it is not an Active NFFE). 6 The "reporting" of such accounts is set out as being an "excluded choice" in terms of section 185 F(7) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 4U.S. reportable accounts guidance notes 10. The term "financial account" is defined in Article 1(1)(s) of the IGA and means an account maintained by a financial institution, and includes: (1) In the case of an entity that is a financial institution solely because it is an investment entity, any equity or debt interest (other than interests that are regularly traded on an established securities market) in the financial institution. (2) In the case of a financial institution not described paragraph (1) 7 any equity or debt interest in the financial institution (other than interests that are regularly traded on an established securities market), if (i) the value of the debt or equity interest is determined, directly or indirectly, primarily by reference to assets that give rise to U.S. source withholdable payments, and (ii) the class of interests was established with a purpose of avoiding reporting in accordance with the IGA. (3) Any cash value insurance contract and any annuity contract issued or maintained by a financial institution, other than a noninvestment-linked, non- transferable immediate life annuity that is issued to an individual and monetizes a pension or disability benefit provided under an account, product, or arrangement that is excluded from the definition of financial account in Annex II of the IGA. \[Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "financial account" does not include any account, product, or arrangement that is excluded from the definition of financial account in Annex II of the IGA. For the purposes of the IGA, interests are "regularly traded" if there is a meaningful 8 volume of trading with respect to the interests on an ongoing basis, and an "established securities market" 9 means an exchange that is officially recognized and supervised by a governmental authority in which the market is located and that has a meaningful annual value of shares traded on the exchange. For the purposes of this definition of "financial account" in the IGA, an interest in a financial institution is not "regularly traded" and shall be treated as a financial account if the holder of the interest (other than a financial institution acting as an intermediary) is registered on the books of such financial institution. The preceding sentence will not apply to interests first registered on the books of such financial institution prior to July 1, 2014, and with respect to interests first registered on the books of such financial institution on or after July 1, 2014, a financial institution is not required to apply the preceding sentence prior to January 1, 2016.\] 11. The term "financial account" also covers "depository accounts" and "custodial accounts" maintained by a financial institution. 12. A financial institution may maintain more than one type of account. For example, an entity that is a depository institution may maintain both depository and custodial accounts. Example 1: Reporting NZFI is a depository institution that also provides trustee and custodial services. Reporting NZFI maintains both depository accounts and custodial accounts. 10 Reporting NZFI receives gross income from custodial services (the holding of financial assets and related financial services) that equates to 15% of its total gross income (during the previous three years ending 31 December). Therefore, Reporting NZFI is not a custodial institution. 11 Reporting NZFI carries out due diligence in relation to these depository and custodian accounts and identifies that four of them (two of the depository accounts and two of the custodial accounts) have a balance or value that exceeds the reporting threshold 12 and are held by Specified U.S. Persons. Is Reporting NZFI required to report on these accounts? Yes. Reporting NZFI is a depository institution as defined in the IGA. It is irrelevant that Reporting NZFI is not a custodial institution. The only requirement is that the entity is at least one type of financial institution as defined in the IGA and is a Reporting NZFI. 13. In the following paragraphs we discuss the types of financial accounts in more detail. 7 This would cover situations such as where a financial institution is solely a custodial, depository, or specified insurance company or where a financial institution has combined features of various types of financial institution (e.g. both a custodial institution and investment entity), and, therefore, is not "solely" a financial institution because it is an investment entity. The various types of financial institutions are outlined in detail in Inland Revenue's "registration" guidance notes. 8 Whether there is a "meaningful volume of trading" will be a question of fact and degree. Inland Revenue considers that if, for instance, interests are traded on an established securities market and relate to a "widely held company" (based on the Income Tax Act 2007 definition) there can be a presumption that a meaningful volume of trading has occurred, unless this presumption is rebutted by evidence to the contrary (such as the entity being a dormant entity). 9 The Inland Revenue considers that the New Zealand Stock Market as administered by NZX Limited, the Australian Stock Market as administered by the Australian Securities Exchange, and the New York Stock Exchange registered under the US Securities Exchange Act 1934 are examples of "established securities markets". 10 It is assumed, for the purposes of this example, that the accounts are not excluded accounts (discussed below). 11 The meaning of "custodial institution" is set out in detail in Inland Revenue's "registration" guidance notes. 12 These thresholds are explained in detail in Inland Revenue's due diligence guidance notes. 5U.S. reportable accounts guidance notes Depository Account 14. A depository account maintained by a financial institution will (unless excluded) 13 be a financial account. The term "depository account" is defined in Article 1(1)(t) of the IGA and includes any commercial, checking, savings, time, 14 or thrift account, 15 or an account that is evidenced by a certificate of deposit, thrift certificate, investment certificate, certificate of indebtedness, or other similar instrument maintained by a financial institution in the ordinary course of a banking or similar business. A depository account also includes an amount held by an insurance company pursuant to a guaranteed investment contract or similar agreement to pay or credit interest. 15. A depository account does not require that interest be paid on the account to the account holder 16 . A depository account will also include credit cards 17 (where the financial institution permits deposits to be made by the account holder in excess of the amount due to the financial institution) and pre-loaded cash cards e.g. pre-loaded foreign currency travel cards 18 . 16. Therefore, the definition of depository account is broad and extends beyond conventional depository accounts to cover, for example, certificates of indebtedness and instruments maintained by depository institutions in the ordinary course of their business. The breadth of this definition means that, as explained below, for depository institutions there may be an overlap between "depository accounts" and "debt interests." In other words, an account may be both a depository account and a debt interest. This is conceptually similar to how the same entity can be two types of financial institution for FATCA purposes (for example, an entity could be both a depository institution and an investment entity). 19 Custodial Account 17. A custodial account maintained by a financial institution will (unless excluded) 20 also be a financial account. The term "custodial account" is defined in Article 1(1)(u) of the IGA and means an account (other than an insurance contract or annuity contract) for the benefit of another person that holds any financial instrument or contract held for investment (including, but not limited to, a share or stock in a corporation, a note, bond, debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness, a currency or commodity transaction, a credit default swap, a swap based upon a nonfinancial index, a notional principal contract, an insurance contract or annuity contract, and any option or other derivative instrument). 18. An insurance (including a cash value insurance contract) or annuity contract are not custodial accounts, but can be assets held in a custodial account. Example 2: Custodial Limited is a custodial institution and a Reporting NZFI and provides a safe custody service for securities e.g. debt interest or shares, held on behalf of its customers. Custodial Limited holds the securities as bare trustee for their clients who are the beneficial owners. 21 Custodial Limited carries out all administrative aspects related to holding the securities i.e. collection of income, taking care of corporate actions relating to shares, sales and acquisitions, and dealing with all correspondence. Is this a custodial account? Yes, it is an account for the benefit of clients which holds financial instruments i.e. shares, debt interests, etc. Custodial Limited will (provided that the accounts are not excluded – see below) need to carry out due diligence on the account holders (the clients who are the beneficial owners) to determine whether the accounts are U.S. Reportable Accounts, and, therefore, need to be reported. 12 These thresholds are explained in detail in Inland Revenue's due diligence guidance notes. 13 These exclusions are discussed below. 14 Inland Revenue views a "time account" as simply the same as a term deposit account. Where a term deposit is in whole or in part rolled over at maturity, the new term deposit is not required to be treated as a "new" account (see Inland Revenue's "due diligence" guidance notes regarding a detailed outline of what constitutes a "new" account). This will apply to term deposits where the roll-over decision is made prior to maturity, or within a reasonable time after the term deposit matures. 15 We are not aware of the expression "thrift account" being used specifically in New Zealand, but would view a thrift account as simply a savings account. 16 This is implicit from the inclusion of checking accounts in the "depository account" definition in Article 1(1)(t) of the IGA. Credit amounts in checking accounts do not normally pay interest to the account holder. 17 We note that FATCA contains a number of provisions that are potentially relevant in the context of credit cards: the U.S. $50,000 rule that applies in relation to new entity accounts (to exempt such accounts where the Reporting NZFI implements policies and procedures to prevent an account balance owed to the account holder exceeding U.S. $50,000) and the "qualified credit card issuer" category in annex II of the IGA. These matters are elaborated on in Inland Revenue's "due diligence" and "registration" guidance notes. 18 Although credit card accounts are not specifically referred to in this definition, the fact they are referred to in other parts of the IGA implies that they are depository accounts. A pre-loaded cash card would perform the same function as a credit card which permits the account holder to make deposits in excess of the amount due, so would also constitute a depository account. 19 The relevant types of financial institutions are outlined in detail in Inland Revenue's "registration" guidance notes. 20 These exclusions are discussed below. 21 For the purposes of this example it is assumed that the clients themselves who hold the relevant beneficial interest, as opposed to the clients holding that interest on behalf of someone else. 6U.S. reportable accounts guidance notes Example 3: Online Escrow Ltd provides an on-line escrow service for buyers and suppliers of goods and services. On-line Escrow Ltd is a custodial institution and a Reporting NZFI. John has an antique vase which Julie wishes to buy for U.S. $75,000. To secure the purchase price, John opens an on-line escrow account with On-line Escrow Ltd, and specifies that he is the supplier and Julie is the buyer. Julie deposits 10% of the purchase price into the on-line escrow account as security, pending completion of the transaction. Julie then receives the vase, pays the remaining 90% of the purchase price into the account, and notifies On-line Escrow Ltd that the purchase price (less escrow fees) can be released to John. There is no income earned on the assets in the account. Is John's escrow account a financial account? No, whilst it satisfies the definition of custodial account, it is excluded from the definition of financial account under the escrow exclusion in Annex II of the IGA, 22 because it is an account to secure Julie's obligation to pay the purchase price of personal property and the other elements of the escrow account exclusion are satisfied. The escrow account exclusion in the IGA is discussed in more detail below. Example 4: Margin Ltd is a custodial institution and a Reporting NZFI. It provides margin lending to customers to acquire shares. Vanessa is a Specified U.S. Person, and approaches Margin Ltd for a loan. Vanessa has U.S. $200,000 to invest and based on the margin lending ratio of 50%, Margin Ltd is prepared to lend Vanessa U.S. $200,000. In total then she has U.S. $400,000 to invest in approved securities. To secure the loan to Vanessa, the shares are transferred into the name of Margin Ltd and held as security until the loan is repaid. Dividends on the shares are credited to Vanessa during the term of the security arrangement. A fall in the market value of the shares below U.S. $400,000 will trigger a margin call on the loan to restore the margin lending ratio to 50%. Is Vanessa's margin loan a U.S. Reportable Account? Yes, it is a custodial account held by a Specified U.S. Person. The financial account exclusion in Annex II 23 of the IGA for escrow accounts does not apply to margin lending accounts. The escrow account exclusion in the IGA is discussed in more detail below. Equity or Debt Interests 19. An "equity" or "debt" interest maintained by a financial institution will (unless excluded) 24 also be a financial account in the following circumstances: (1) Where the equity or debt interest (other than where those interest are regularly traded on an established securities market) is in a financial institution which is a financial institution solely because it is an investment entity. (2) Where the equity or debt interest (other than where those interest are regularly traded on an established securities market) is in a financial institution, other than one described in paragraph (1) 25 if (i) the value equity or debt interest is determined, directly or indirectly, primarily by reference to assets which give rise to U.S. source withholdable payments and (ii) the class of interest was established with a purpose of avoiding reporting in accordance with the IGA. \[For the purposes of the IGA, interests are "regularly traded" if there is a meaningful volume of trading with respect to the interests on an ongoing basis, and an "established securities market" 26 means an exchange that is officially recognized and supervised by a governmental authority in which the market is located and that has a meaningful annual value of shares traded on the exchange. For the purposes of the definition of "financial account" in the IGA, an interest in a financial institution is not "regularly traded" and shall be treated as a financial account if the holder of the interest (other than a financial institution acting as an intermediary) is registered on the books of such financial institution. The preceding sentence will not apply to interests first registered on the books of such financial institution prior to July 1, 2014, and with respect to interests first registered on the books of such financial institution on or after July 1, 2014, a financial institution is not required to apply the preceding sentence prior to January 1, 2016.\] 20. An "equity interest" is defined in Article 1(1)(v) of the IGA to mean, in the case of a partnership that is a financial institution, either a capital or profits interest in the partnership. In the case of a trust that is a financial institution, an equity interest is considered to be held by any person treated as a settlor or beneficiary 27 of all or a portion of the trust, or any other natural person exercising ultimate effective control over the trust. For example, a settlor of a trust has and holds an equity interest in the trust which the settlor settles. 21. In the context of a company or corporation, the Inland Revenue considers that an equity interest will be either shares or stock which represents an ownership interest in the company or corporation. 22 The Annex II (of the IGA) exclusions are discussed in detail below. 23 The Annex II (of the IGA) exclusions are discussed in detail below. 24 These exclusions are discussed below. 25 This would covers situations such as where a financial institution is solely a custodial, depository, or specified insurance company or where a financial institution has combined features of various types of financial institution (e.g. both a custodial institution and investment entity), and, therefore, is not "solely" a financial institution because it is an investment entity. 26 We consider that the NZX, the NZDX, and the NZAX are examples of established securities markets. 27 A Specified U.S. person shall be treated as being a beneficiary of a foreign trust if such Specified U.S. person has the right to receive directly or indirectly (for example, through a nominee) a mandatory distribution or may receive, directly or indirectly, a discretionary distribution from the trust. 7U.S. reportable accounts guidance notes 22. The expression "debt interest" is not defined in the IGA or the U.S. Treasury Regulations. The Inland Revenue considers that a debt interest is any interest created when a lender lends money to a borrower. In the FATCA context any loan by a lender to a financial institution will create a debt interest in the financial institution. The debt interest can arise through, for example, a simple loan, a bond issue or note issue. As noted above, for depository institutions, there could be an overlap between the definition of debt interest and the definition of depository account (due to the breadth of the definition of depository account) i.e. an account could have the character of being both a debt interest and a depository account in the context of such businesses. 28 Example 5: Reporting NZFI is a property investment trust that is a managed investment scheme under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. Units in the property trust are listed on the NZX. There is a meaningful volume of trading with respect to these interests on an ongoing basis. The NZX is an exchange that is officially recognized and supervised by a governmental authority in New Zealand and that has a meaningful annual value of shares traded on the exchange. Therefore, the NZX is an "established securities market." Reporting NZFI is an investment entity and does not satisfy any of the other "financial institution" definitions in the IGA. On 1 June 2016 Custodial Institution Limited (a custodial institution) obtains 1,000,000 units in Reporting NZFI (with a value of U.S. $1,000,000) as a custodial intermediary for underlying individual investors, which include Specified U.S. Persons. Custodial Institution Limited is registered as the holder of the units on the books of Reporting NZFI. Is the interest that Custodial Institution Limited holds in Reporting NZFI (as a result of holding the units) a "financial account" that could be a U.S. Reportable Account from Reporting NZFI's perspective? 29 Reporting NZFI is a financial institution "solely" because it is an investment entity. This means that paragraph (1) of the definition of "financial account" in Article 1(1)(s) of the IGA is relevant. The units are "equity interests" in Reporting NZFI. This is because the unit holders are beneficiaries of the unit trust. These "equity interests" are "regularly traded" on an established securities market (the NZX). Custodial Institution Limited is the holder of these units and is registered as such on Reporting NZFI's books. Custodial Institution Limited is a financial institution acting as an intermediary (for the underlying investors). Therefore, Custodial Institution Limited's interest in Reporting NZFI is an equity interest that is "regularly traded" and is excluded from the definition of "financial account", and, therefore, cannot be a U.S. Reportable Account. This means that Reporting NZFI will not need to carry out due diligence in relation to this account. On the other hand, Custodial Institution Limited will 30 be required to report on any Specified U.S. Persons, which are account holders (i.e. the underlying individual investors) of the custodial account. Example 6: Reporting NZFI is a property investment trust that is a managed investment scheme under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. Units in the property trust are listed on the NZX. There is a meaningful volume of trading with respect to these interests on an ongoing basis. The NZX is an exchange that is officially recognized and supervised by a governmental authority in New Zealand and that has a meaningful annual value of shares traded on the exchange. Therefore, the NZX is an "established securities market." Reporting NZFI is an investment entity and does not satisfy any of the other "financial institution" definitions in the IGA. On 1 June 2016 Mr Toms obtains 1,000,000 units in Reporting NZFI (with a value of U.S. $1,000,000). Mr Toms is registered as the holder of the units on the books of Reporting NZFI. Is the interest that Mr Toms holds in Reporting NZFI (as a result of holding the units) a "financial account" that could be a U.S. Reportable Account? 31 Reporting NZFI is a financial institution "solely" because it is an investment entity. This means that paragraph (1) of the definition of "financial account" in Article 1(1)(s) of the IGA is relevant. The units are "equity interests" in the property trust. This is because the unit holders are beneficiaries of the unit trust. Mr Toms is the holder of these units that is registered as such on Reporting NZFI's books. Mr Toms is not a financial institution. The definition of "financial account" in the IGA deems an equity or debt interest to be not "regularly traded", where the holder of that interest (other than a financial institution acting as an intermediary) is "registered on the books" of the financial institution. Therefore, even though the units are factually regularly traded on an established securities market, Mr Toms' interest in Reporting NZFI is an equity interest that is deemed to not be "regularly traded" (the interest was acquired after the effective dates of the transitional provisions) . This means that this interest is a financial account and could be a U.S. Reportable Account. Therefore, Reporting NZFI will need to carry out due diligence in relation to this account. We note that this answer would be the same even if Mr Toms' interest was held through a non-financial intermediary (that is not a financial institution) as nominee. In such an instance, Mr Toms would still be the relevant account holder. The definition of "account holder" (in Article 1(1)(dd) of the IGA) is explained in detail below. 28 It is noted that such an account would still be a single account (and, therefore, potentially a single U.S. Reportable Account). This point merely relates to the character of the account. 29 It is assumed for the purposes of this example that the account is not a depository account or a custodial account and is not an excluded account coming within Annex II of the IGA (discussed below). 30 This is based on the assumption that Custodial Institution Limited will be a Reporting NZFI. 31 It is assumed for the purposes of this example that the account is not a depository account or a custodial account and is not an excluded account coming within Annex II of the IGA (discussed below). 8U.S. reportable accounts guidance notes Example 7: The same facts as example 6, other than as to when Mr Toms acquires the units. On 1 August 2014 Mr Toms obtains 1,000,000 units in Reporting NZFI (with a value of U.S. $1,000,000). Mr Toms is registered as the holder of the units on the books of Reporting NZFI. On 1 January 2016 Mr Toms remains the holder of the interests. Does Reporting NZFI need to carry out FATCA due diligence on the account of Mr Toms? Ye s . Reporting NZFI is a financial institution "solely" because it is an investment entity. This means that paragraph (1) of the definition of "financial account" in Article 1(1)(s) of the IGA is relevant. The units are "equity interests" in the property trust. This is because the unit holders are beneficiaries of the unit trust. Mr Toms is the holder of these units that is registered as such on Reporting NZFI's books. Mr Toms is not a financial institution. The definition of "financial account" in the IGA deems an equity or debt interest (held from 1 January 2016) to be not "regularly traded", where the holder of that interest (other than a financial institution acting as an intermediary) is "registered on the books" of the financial institution. Therefore, even though the units are factually regularly traded on an established securities market, Mr Toms' interest in Reporting NZFI is an equity interest that is (from 1 January 2016) deemed to not be "regularly traded". This means that this interest is a financial account and could be a U.S. Reportable Account. Therefore, Reporting NZFI will need to carry out due diligence in relation to this account. Example 8: The same facts as example 6, other than as to when Mr Toms obtains and sells the units. On 1 August 2014 Mr Toms obtains 1,000,000 units in Reporting NZFI (with a value of U.S. $1,000,000). Mr Toms is registered as the holder of the units on the books of Reporting NZFI. On 1 December 2015 Mr Toms sells all of his units in Reporting NZFIs. Did Mr Toms ever have a financial account that Reporting NZFI would need to carry out due diligence on? No. Reporting NZFI is a financial institution "solely" because it is an investment entity. This means that paragraph (1) of the definition of "financial account" in Article 1(1)(s) of the IGA is relevant. The units are "equity interests" in the property trust and are factually regularly traded. They were also sold before 1 January 2016. They were not financial accounts from the point they were purchased until when they were sold (as the "regularly traded" exclusion from the definition of "financial account" applied - due to the transitional provision). This means that Mr Toms never held a financial account. Therefore, Reporting NZFI does not need to carry out FATCA due diligence on the account that Mr Toms held. Example 9: Reporting NZFI is a depository institution. Reporting NZFI has issued outstanding bonds with a face value of U.S. $200,000,000 listed on the NZX Debt Market ("NZDX"). There is a meaningful volume of trading with respect to these interests on an ongoing basis. The NZDX is an established securities market. The bonds were not established with a purpose of avoiding reporting in accordance with the IGA. On 1 June 2016 Ms Glen purchases U.S. $500,000 of Reporting NZFI's corporate bonds. Ms Glen is registered as the holder on the books of Reporting NZFI. Is Ms Glen's interest in Reporting NZFI a "financial account" that could be a U.S. Reportable Account? 32 The bonds are "debt interests" in a depository institution. Therefore, Reporting NZFI is not a financial institution "solely" because it is an investment entity (i.e. it is a depository institution). This means that paragraph (2) of the definition of "financial account" in Article 1(1)(s) of the IGA is relevant. The bonds are factually regularly traded on an established securities market. However, Ms Glen is registered as the holder of the bonds on Reporting NZFI's books. Ms Glen is not a financial institution. Therefore, the bonds are deemed to not be "regularly traded". However, Reporting NZFI did not establish the bonds with a purpose of avoiding reporting in accordance with the IGA. Therefore, in terms of paragraph (2) of the definition of "financial account", the bonds are not a debt interest financial account. This means that, provided that the bonds do not constitute depository accounts, 33 Reporting NZFI will not need to carry out due diligence in relation to this account. 32 It is assumed for the purposes of this example that the account is not a depository account or a custodial account and is not an excluded account coming within Annex II of the IGA (discussed below). 33 The definition of "depository account" in Article 1(1)(t) of the IGA "includes any commercial, checking, savings, time, or thrift account, or an account that is evidenced by a certificate of deposit, thrift certificate, investment certificate, certificate of indebtedness, or other similar instrument maintained by a Financial Institution in the ordinary course of a banking or similar business. A depository account also includes an amount held by an insurance company pursuant to a guaranteed investment contract or similar agreement to pay or credit interest thereon." This definition is very broad and extends to cover debt instruments maintained by a financial institution in the ordinary course of a banking or similar business. This means that a debt instrument maintained by a depository institution could be a depository account of that institution. This will depend on the nature of the instrument and whether such an institution maintains such an account in the ordinary course of their banking or similar business. 9U.S. reportable accounts guidance notes Example 10: Bank Magic Ltd is a depository institution and a Reporting NZFI. To strengthen its capital adequacy position it issues 5 year mandatory conversion convertible notes ("MCCNs") which pay an interest rate based on a standard commercial benchmark. The MCCNs convert to shares in Bank Magic Ltd, at the lower of $20 or a 2% discount to the average of the daily volume weighted average price of the shares for the previous 14 business days. A meaningful volume of the MCCNs are regularly traded on the NZX (an established securities market) on an on-going basis. On 1 June 2016 Custodial New Zealand Limited (a custodial institution) purchases U.S. $500,000 of Bank Magic Ltd's MCCNs. Custodial New Zealand Limited is registered as such on the books of Bank Magic Ltd as being the holder of the interest as a custodial intermediary for underlying individual investors, which include Specified US Persons. Is Custodial New Zealand Limited's interest in Bank Magic Ltd a "financial account" maintained by Bank Magic Ltd that could be a U.S. Reportable Account? 34 No. The MCCNs are "debt/equity interests" in a depository institution. Therefore, Bank Magic Ltd is not a financial institution "solely" because it is an investment entity. This means that paragraph (2) of the definition of "financial account" in Article 1(1)(s) of the IGA is relevant. The MCCNs are hybrid securities having both debt and equity characteristics. The MCCNs clearly constitute a "debt or equity interest" in terms of paragraph (2) of the definition of "financial account." The MCCNs are regularly traded on an established securities market and are held by a financial institution acting as an intermediary. Therefore, they come within the "regularly traded" exclusion in paragraph (2) of the definition of "financial account". Accordingly, Custodial New Zealand Limited's interest in Bank Magic Ltd is not a debt or equity interest "financial account". This means that, provided that the interest does not constitute a depository account, Bank Magic Ltd will not need to carry out due diligence in relation to this account. However, Custodial Institution Limited 35 will be required to report on any Specified U.S. Persons, which are account holders (i.e. the underlying individual investors) of the custodial account. Cash value insurance contract 23. A "cash value insurance contract" issued or maintained by a financial institution will (unless excluded) 36 also be a financial account. 24. The term "cash value insurance contract" is defined in Article 1(1)(y) of the IGA as meaning an insurance contract (other than an indemnity reinsurance contract between two insurance companies) that has a cash value greater than U.S. $50,000. "Insurance contract" and "cash value" are, in turn, also defined in the IGA. 25. "Insurance contract" is defined in Article 1(1)(w) of the IGA as meaning a contract (other than an annuity contract) under which the issuer agrees to pay an amount upon the occurrence of a specified contingency involving mortality, morbidity, accident, liability, or property risk. 26. "Cash value" is defined in Article 1(1)(z) of the IGA as meaning the greater of (i) the amount that the policyholder is entitled to receive upon surrender or termination of the contract (determined without reduction for any surrender charge or policy loan), and (ii) the amount the policyholder can borrow under or with regard to the contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "cash value" does not include an amount payable under an insurance contract as: (1) a personal injury or sickness benefit or other benefit providing indemnification of an economic loss incurred upon the occurrence of the event insured against; (2) a refund to the policyholder of a previously paid premium under an insurance contract (other than under a life insurance contract) due to policy cancellation or termination, decrease in risk exposure during the effective period of the insurance contract, or arising from a redetermination of the premium due to correction of posting or other similar error; or (3) a policyholder dividend based upon the underwriting experience of the contract or group involved. Annuity contract 27. An annuity contract maintained by a financial institution will (unless excluded) 37 also be a financial account provided that it is not a noninvestment-linked, non- transferable immediate life annuity that is issued to an individual and monetizes a pension or disability benefit provided under an account that is excluded from the definition of financial account in Annex II of the IGA – discussed below. 28. The term "annuity contract" is defined in Article 1(1)(x) of the IGA as meaning a contract under which the issuer agrees to make payments for a period of time determined in whole or in part by reference to the life expectancy of one or more individuals. The term also includes a contract that is considered to be an annuity contract in accordance with the law, regulation, or practice of the jurisdiction in which the contract was issued, and under which the issuer agrees to make payments for a term of years. 34 It is assumed for the purposes of this example that the account is not a depository account or a custodial account and is not an excluded account coming within Annex II of the IGA (discussed below). 35 This is based on the assumption that Custodial Institution Limited will be a Reporting NZFI. 36 These exclusions are discussed below. 37 These exclusions are discussed below. 10U.S. reportable accounts guidance notes When is a financial account maintained by a Reporting NZFI? 29. Another key element of the definition of "U.S. Reportable Account" is that the financial account is "maintained" 38 by a Reporting NZFI. 30. A custodial account is "maintained" by a Reporting NZFI that holds custody over the assets in the account. A depository account, cash value insurance contract or annuity contract is "maintained" by a Reporting NZFI that is obligated (excluding an agent) to make payments in respect of the account or contract. Any equity or debt interest in a Reporting NZFI is "maintained" by the issuing NZFI. Example 11: Mr H has a depository account at Bank A (a Reporting NZFI). The account is a financial account. Bank A is obligated to make payments to Mr H in respect of this account. Therefore, this account is a financial account that is maintained by Bank A. How does a Reporting NZFI that maintains a financial account determine who holds the account? 31. Another key element of the definition of "U.S. Reportable Account" involves determining who "holds" the financial account (i.e. whether the account is held by one or more Specified U.S. persons or by a Non-U.S. entity passive NFFE with one or more controlling persons that are Specified U.S. persons, and, therefore, assuming that the account is not exempted or excluded, is a U.S. Reportable account). 32. The IGA does not define "held by". However, the definition of "account holder" in Article 1(1)(dd) of the IGA is relevant for determining what "held by" means in this context. 33. An "account holder" is defined in Article 1(1)(dd) of the IGA to mean: "... the person listed or identified as the holder of a Financial Account by the Financial Institution that maintains the account. A person, other than a Financial Institution, holding a Financial Account for the benefit or account of another person as agent, custodian, nominee, signatory, investment advisor, or intermediary, is not treated as holding the account for the purposes of this Agreement, and such other person is treated as holding the account. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the term "Financial Institution' does not include a Financial Institution organized or incorporated in a U.S. Territory. In the case of a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract, the Account Holder is any person entitled to access the Cash Value or change the beneficiary of the contract. If no person can access the Cash Value or change the beneficiary, the Account Holder is any person named as the owner in the contract and any person with a vested entitlement to payment under the terms of the contract. Upon the maturity of a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract, each person entitled to receive a payment under the contract is treated as an Account Holder." 34. A "person" is defined in §1.471-1(b)(94) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations to mean a person defined in section 7701(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under section 7701(a)(1) the term "person" includes an individual, a trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation. It is clear for the purposes of FATCA, that an account holder can be an entity (e.g. trust or partnership) that would not ordinarily have a separate legal personality. This means that trusts and partnerships are "persons" that can be account holders for the purposes of FATCA. 35. In the case of a cash value insurance contract or annuity contract, the account holder is any person entitled to access the cash value or change the beneficiary of the contract. If no person can access the cash value or change the beneficiary, the account holder is any person named as the owner in the contract and any person with a vested entitlement to payment under the terms of the contract. Upon the maturity of a cash value insurance contract or an annuity contract, each person entitled to receive a payment under the contract is treated as an account holder. 36. An "account holder" does not include a person (other than a financial institution 39 ) who holds an account for another person as "....agent, custodian, nominee, signatory, investment advisor, or intermediary...." In these circumstances the person on whose behalf the account is held is the account holder. The Inland Revenue expects that Reporting NZFIs will have in place reasonable procedures to determine whether an account holder holds an account on behalf of another person. Where a Reporting NZFI follows those procedures and determines that there is no "on behalf of" relationship, then it will be appropriate for the Reporting NZFI to treat the person that is "listed or identified" as holding the account as being the account holder. For new individual account openings, it would be appropriate that a Reporting NZFI would include questions as to what capacity the account opener intends to hold a financial account so that they are in a position to determine whether such an "on behalf of" relationship exists. Example 12: On 1 August 2014 Ms B opens up a bank account (a financial account) 40 with a Reporting NZFI and requests that her daughter Lucy be included as a signatory to the account. The account holder is Ms B. Lucy is not an account holder as she is only a signatory to the account. The Reporting NZFI will need to apply the new individual account due diligence procedures in relation to Ms B's account to determine whether it is a U.S. Reportable Account. 38 Refer to §1.1471-5(b)(5) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations for an explanation of when a financial institution will be considered to "maintain" an account. 39 This reference to "financial institution" does not include a financial institution organized or incorporated in a U.S. Territory. 40 It is assumed, for the purposes of this example, that the account balance or value exceeds the threshold exemptions in the IGA and that the account is not an excluded account. 11U.S. reportable accounts guidance notes Example 13: Ms C is a trustee of her discretionary family trust. The beneficiaries include Ms C's four children. On 1 August 2014 Ms C opens up an account (a financial account) 41 with a Reporting NZFI and it is noted in the account opening documentation that Ms C and the other trustees hold the account in their capacity as trustees for Ms C's family trust. The account holder is the trust (an entity) and not Ms C or other trustees or any of the beneficiaries. The Reporting NZFI will need to apply the new entity account due diligence procedures 42 in relation to the trust's account to determine whether it is a U.S. Reportable Account. Example 14: Mr B is a trustee of his fixed family trust. The beneficiaries are Mr B's two children. On 1 August 2014 Mr B opens up an account (a financial account) 43 with a Reporting NZFI but does not advise in the account opening documentation (or otherwise) that the account is to be held in his capacity as trustee for Mr B's family trust. The Reporting NZFI does not know or have reason to know of the existence of the trust relationship. The account holder will be Mr B and not the trust. The Reporting NZFI will need to apply the new individual account due diligence procedures in relation to Mr B's account to determine whether it is a U.S. Reportable Account. How does a Reporting NZFI that maintains a financial account determine whether the account is a U.S. Reportable account? 37. A Reporting NZFI will also need to determine whether financial accounts that it maintains (that are not exempted or excluded) are, in this respect, "held by" one or more Specified U.S. persons or by a Non-U.S. entity that is a passive NFFE 44 with one or more controlling persons that is a Specified U.S. person, and, therefore, are U.S. Reportable Accounts. 38. The terms "Specified U.S. Person", "Non-U.S. entity", and "controlling persons" are, in turn, all defined in Article 1(1) of the IGA. We will now briefly set out these definitions, before explaining how they feed into the definition of "U.S. Reportable Accounts" and the process that Reporting NZFIs will need to apply to identify such accounts. 39. "Specified U.S. Persons" is defined in Article 1(1)(ff) of the IGA to mean a "U.S. person" other than: 45 • a corporation the stock of which is regularly traded on one or more established securities markets \[For the purposes of the IGA, interests are "regularly traded" if there is a meaningful volume of trading with respect to the interests on an ongoing basis, and an "established securities market" 46 means an exchange that is officially recognized and supervised by a governmental authority in which the market is located and that has a meaningful annual value of shares traded on the exchange\]; • any corporation that is a member of the same expanded affiliated group as a corporation the stock of which is regularly traded on one or more established securities markets; • the U.S. or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality thereof; • any State of the U.S., any U.S. Territory, any political subdivision of any of the foregoing, or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing; • any regulated investment company as defined in section 851 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or any entity registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-64); • a dealer in securities, commodities, or derivative financial instruments (including notional principal contracts, futures, forwards, and options) that is registered as such under the laws of the U.S. or any State; or • any one of the following as specifically defined in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code: certain organizations exempt from taxation (including certain trusts that are tax exempt or that are otherwise described in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code), certain individual retirement plans, certain banks, certain real estate investment trusts, any common trust fund, certain brokers. 47 40. A "U.S. Person" is, in turn, defined in Article 1(1)(ee) of the IGA to mean the following: • a U.S. citizen or resident individual; • a partnership or corporation organized in the U.S. or under the U.S. law; • certain trusts that are subject to U.S. law in terms of their administration which are controlled by a US person; or • an estate of a deceased U.S. citizen or resident. 41 It is assumed, for the purposes of this example, that the account balance or value exceeds the threshold exemptions in the IGA and that the account is not an excluded account. 42 These procedures are discussed in detail in Inland Revenue's "due diligence" guidance notes. 43 It is assumed, for the purposes of this example, that the account balance or value exceeds the threshold exemptions in the IGA and that the account is not an excluded account. 44 Reporting NZFIs will only need to report on Non-U.S. entity financial accounts (that are not exempted or excluded) as being U.S. Reportable Accounts if the accounts are held by passive NFFEs with one or more controlling persons that are Specified U.S. Persons. 45 This is a summary of the definition of "Specified U.S. Person" in the IGA. The reader should consult the definition of "Specified U.S. Person" in the IGA to see the full definition. 46 The Inland Revenue considers that the New Zealand Stock Market as administered by NZX Limited, the Australian Stock Market as administered by the Australian Securities Exchange, and the New York Stock Exchange registered under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act 1934 are examples of "established securities markets". 47 The reader should consult the definition of "Specified U.S. Person" in Article 1(1)(ff) of the IGA to identify the specific section references in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code relating to these entities or persons. 12U.S. reportable accounts guidance notes 41. An account maintained by a Reporting NZFI that is held by a Specified U.S. person (and that is not exempt or excluded) is a type of U.S. Reportable account. 42. The term "Non-U.S. Entity" is also defined in Article 1(1)(hh) of the IGA as meaning "an Entity that is not a U.S. Person." A Non- U.S. entity that is not a foreign financial institution (as defined in U.S. Treasury Regulations), is an entity described in Annex I VI (B)(4)(j) of the IGA, or is an entity established in New Zealand or another partner jurisdiction and that is not a financial institution, will be a Non- Financial Foreign Entity ("NFFE"). There are two types of NFFEs which are relevant for FATCA purposes: Active or Passive NFFEs. A common type of passive NFFE would be a trust such as a family trust. 48 NFFEs are explained in detail in Inland Revenue's "due diligence" guidance notes. An account maintained by a Reporting NZFI that is held by a Non-U.S. entity passive NFFE that has one or more controlling persons that are Specified U.S. persons (and that is not exempt or excluded) is another type of a U.S. Reportable account. 43. The term "controlling person" is, in turn, defined in Article 1(1)(mm) of the IGA as meaning a natural person who exercises control over an entity. This would include the following: • Shareholders and directors of private or publicly listed companies that exercise control over the company. • Natural person partners of a partnership that exercise control over the partnership. • The IGA specifically defines controlling persons in regard to trust as the settlor, trustees, the protector (if any), beneficiaries or a class of beneficiaries, and any other natural person exercising ultimate effective control over a trust. • In the case of legal arrangements other than a trust, control is held by person in "equivalent or similar positions". 44. The term "controlling persons" must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations. 45. The due diligence procedures in the IGA provide a framework that Reporting NZFIs need to apply to identify whether financial accounts that they maintain (that are not excluded or exempted) are either held by one or more Specified U.S. persons or by a Non-U.S. entity that is a passive NFFE 49 with one or more controlling persons that is a Specified U.S. person. These are U.S. Reportable Accounts. 46. However, it should be noted that the IGA in its terms, contemplates that the application of the due diligence procedures in Annex I will not be exact. For example, a Reporting NZFI may correctly carry out due diligence procedures set out in Annex I, but ultimately fail to identify an account as being held by a Specified U.S. Person even when the account is, in fact, actually held by a Specified U.S. Person. This possibility is highlighted in the definition of "U.S. Reportable Account" in Article 1(1)(cc) of the IGA, which says "....an account shall not be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account if such account is not identified as a U.S. Reportable Account after application of the due diligence procedures in Annex I (Emphasis added)". 47. The converse is also true. There are a number of instances in Annex I where a Reporting NZFI is required to "treat" financial accounts that they maintain (that are not excluded or exempted) as being U.S. Reportable Accounts (i.e. essentially "deeming" these accounts as being held by a Specified U.S. Person or by a Non- U.S. entity passive NFFE with a controlling person that is a Specified U.S. Person) of the Reporting NZFI. This is illustrated by the following: • Pre-existing individual financial accounts where a Reporting NZFI has identified U.S. indicia (such as an unambiguous indication of U.S. place of birth) associated with the account and has not "cured" the indicia. 50 In such a case, the Reporting NZFI must treat the account as being a U.S. Reportable Account. • New individual financial accounts where the Reporting NZFI has obtained a self-certification from the account holder to the effect that they that they are not a U.S. citizen or tax resident (and has confirmed the reasonableness of this certification) and there is a change of circumstances that causes the Reporting NZFI to know or have reason to know that the original self certification is incorrect or unreliable, and the Reporting NZFI has not been able to obtain a further valid self-certification (that the account holder is not a U.S. citizen or tax resident). In such a case, the Reporting NZFI must treat the account as being a U.S. Reportable Account. • Pre-existing entity financial accounts where the Reporting NZFI has reviewed information maintained for regulatory or customer relationship purposes (including information collected pursuant to anti-money laundering/know your customer Procedures) and determined that the information indicates that the account holder is a U.S. Person and the Reporting NZFI has not obtained a self-certification from the account holder, or reasonably determined based on information in its possession or that is publicly available, that the account holder is not a Specified U.S. Person. In such a case, the Reporting NZFI must treat the account as being a U.S. Reportable Account. 48 However, this will always be a question of fact. A family trust could, for example, be a financial institution or an active NFFE instead. 49 Reporting NZFIs will only need to report on Non-U.S. entity financial accounts (that are not exempted or excluded) as being U.S. Reportable accounts if the accounts are held by passive NFFEs with one or more controlling persons that are Specified U.S. Persons. 50 For example, the Reporting NZFI that maintains the account may not have elected to cure U.S. indicia. Therefore, they will need to treat the account as being a U.S. Reportable Account. 13U.S. reportable accounts guidance notes Example 15: A Reporting NZFI maintains a pre-existing financial account (as of 30 June 2014) that is held by a trust. The account is not excluded or exempted by threshold. The Reporting NZFI applies the entity 51 due diligence procedures and identifies that the trust is a passive NFFE and that a controlling person of the trust is a U.S. citizen. Therefore, the account is treated as a U.S. Reportable Account. Reporting NZFI would need to report on this account annually to the Inland Revenue (the information that would need to be provided, in this regard, is discussed in more detail below). It should be noted that the U.S. Reportable Account is the financial account held by the trust and not the underlying controlling persons. That is, the identification of any controlling person as a U.S. citizen results in the financial account held by the passive NFFE (the trust) being treated as a U.S. Reportable Account (i.e. being held by a Non-US entity passive NFFE with a controlling person that is a Specified US Person). What accounts are excluded from being U.S. Reportable Accounts? 48. The following accounts are excluded from the definition of "financial account" and therefore shall not be treated as U.S. Reportable Accounts: (a) Equity or debt interests which are regularly traded on an established securities market (as outlined in the IGA) and that are not depository accounts or custodial accounts. (b) A noninvestment-linked, non-transferable immediate life annuity that is issued to an individual and monetizes a pension or disability benefit provided under an account, product or arrangement that is excluded from the definition of financial account in Annex II of the IGA. (c) Any account, product or arrangement excluded from being a financial account in Annex II of the IGA. These products have been agreed as being low risk (in terms of the likelihood that they will be used for tax evasion), and, therefore, are excluded from being financial accounts. Equity or debt interests which are regularly traded on an established securities market 49. As noted above, there is an exemption from reporting by any Reporting NZFI of any equity or debt interest which is regularly traded (as outlined in the definition of "financial account" in Article 1(1)(s) of the IGA) on an established securities market. These accounts are excluded from the definition of "financial account" and therefore shall not be treated as U.S. Reportable Accounts unless, for example, they constitute depository accounts or custodial accounts. Non-investment linked annuities (conventional annuity) 50. The non-investment linked annuity exclusion from the definition of "financial account" only applies to an annuity which has all of the following characteristics: • It is non-investment linked. • It is a non-transferable immediate life annuity. • It is issued to an individual and monetizes a pension or disability benefit provided under an account, product, or arrangement that is excluded from the definition of financial account in Annex II of the IGA. There are only a limited number of pension benefits excluded from the definition of financial account in Annex II of the IGA (discussed below). These annuities are excluded from the definition of "financial account", and, therefore, shall not be treated as U.S. Reportable Accounts. Example 16: Mr ABC has an investment linked life insurance policy. The policy allows the amount payable on termination to exceed the annual premiums paid for the contract. Mr ABC decides to terminate the policy and use the proceeds (U.S. $800,000) to acquire a non-investment linked, non-transferable immediate life annuity from Insurance Company LIFE Limited – a Reporting NZFI. The balance of the account is U.S. $800,000. Is this annuity a financial account? Yes, the account is an "annuity contract" (a type of financial account) as defined in the IGA and is not an excluded account. The exclusion for annuities only applies where it "monetizes a pension or disability benefit provided under an account that is excluded from the definition of financial account in Annex II" of the IGA (discussed below). In this example Mr ABC has monetised an investment linked life insurance contract, which is not excluded from the definition of financial account in Annex II of the IGA. Instead, the account is a financial account. The account balance also exceeds the reporting thresholds. Therefore, the Reporting NZFI will need to carry out due diligence on the account to determine if it is a U.S. Reportable Account. Excluded Financial Accounts in Annex II of the IGA 51. The following accounts are also excluded financial accounts in Annex II of the IGA, and, therefore, shall not be treated as U.S. Reportable Accounts. Whai Rawa approved retirement savings scheme 52. Membership of the Whai Rawa approved retirement savings scheme operated by Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu is excluded from the definition of financial account and therefore shall not be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account. 51 A "trust" comes within the definition of "entity" in Article 1(1)(gg) of the IGA. 14U.S. reportable accounts guidance notes Retirement and Pension Account 53. A retirement or pension account maintained in New Zealand that satisfies the following requirements under the laws of New Zealand is excluded from the definition of financial account and therefore shall not be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account: (a) The account is subject to regulation as a personal retirement account or is part of a registered or regulated retirement or pension plan for the provision of retirement or pension benefits (including disability or death benefits); (b) The account is tax-favoured (i.e. contributions to the account that would otherwise be subject to tax under New Zealand law are deductible or excluded from the gross income of the account holder or taxed at a reduced rate, or taxation of investment income from the account is deferred or taxed at a reduced rate); (c) Annual information reporting is required to the tax authorities in New Zealand with respect to the account; (d) Withdrawals are conditioned on reaching a specified retirement age, disability, or death, or penalties apply to withdrawals made before such specified events; and (e) Either (i) annual contributions are limited to U.S. $50,000 or less, or (ii) there is a maximum lifetime contribution limit to the account of U.S. $1,000,000 or less, in each case applying the rules set out in Annex I of the IGA for account aggregation and currency translation. Non-Retirement Savings Accounts 54. An account maintained in New Zealand (other than an insurance or annuity contract) that satisfies the following requirements under the laws of New Zealand is excluded from the definition of financial account and therefore shall not be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account: (a) The account is subject to regulation as a savings vehicle for purposes other than for retirement; (b) The account is tax-favoured (i.e. contributions to the account that would otherwise be subject to tax under New Zealand law are deductible or excluded from the gross income of the account holder or taxed at a reduced rate, or taxation of investment income from the account is deferred or taxed at a reduced rate); (c) Withdrawals are conditioned on meeting specific criteria related to the purpose of the savings account (for example, the provision of educational or medical benefits), or penalties apply to withdrawals made before such criteria are met; and (d) Annual contributions are limited to U.S. $50,000 or less, applying the rules set out in Annex I for account aggregation and currency translation. Certain Term Life Insurance Contracts 55. A life insurance contract maintained in New Zealand with a coverage period that will end before the insured individual attains age 90 is excluded from the definition of financial account and therefore shall not be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account, provided that the contract satisfies the following requirements: (a) Periodic premiums, which do not decrease over time, are payable at least annually during the period the contract is in existence or until the insured attains age 90, whichever is shorter; (b) The contract has no contract value that any person can access (by withdrawal, loan, or otherwise) without terminating the contract; (c) The amount (other than a death benefit) payable upon cancellation or termination of the contract cannot exceed the aggregate premiums paid for the contract, less the sum of mortality, morbidity, and expense charges (whether or not actually imposed) for the period or periods of the contract's existence and any amounts paid prior to the cancellation or termination of the contract; and (d) The contract is not held by a transferee for value. Account Held by an Estate 56. An account maintained in New Zealand that is held solely by an estate is excluded from the definition of financial account and therefore shall not be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account if the documentation for such account includes a copy of the deceased's will or death certificate. 57. This exclusion would not include any account held by trustees of a testamentary trust created under the will of a deceased. The exclusion also does not apply when there are two or more account holders, even when an estate is one of the account holders. Escrow Accounts 58. An account maintained in New Zealand established in connection with any of the following is excluded from the definition of financial account and therefore shall not be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account: (a) Legislation, a court order or judgment. \[For example, if an account is maintained in New Zealand and has been established in connection with a court order or judgment (such as by the Family Court or under the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988) it will be excluded from the definition of financial account and shall not be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account.\] (b) A sale, exchange, or lease of real or personal property, provided that the account satisfies the following requirements: i. The account is funded solely with a down payment, earnest money, deposit in an amount appropriate to secure an obligation directly related to the transaction, or a similar payment, or is funded with a financial asset that is deposited in the account in connection with the sale, exchange, or lease of the property; 15U.S. reportable accounts guidance notes ii. The account is established and used solely to secure the obligation of the purchaser to pay the purchase price for the property, the seller to pay any contingent liability, or the lessor or lessee to pay for any damages relating to the leased property as agreed under the lease; iii. The assets of the account, including the income earned thereon, will be paid or otherwise distributed for the benefit of the purchaser, seller, lessor, or lessee (including to satisfy such person's obligation) when the property is sold, exchanged, or surrendered, or the lease terminates; iv. The account is not a margin or similar account established in connection with a sale or exchange of a financial asset; and v. The account is not associated with a credit card account. (c) An obligation of a financial institution servicing a loan secured by real property to set aside a portion of a payment solely to facilitate the payment of taxes or insurance related to the real property at a later time. (d) An obligation of a financial institution solely to facilitate the payment of taxes at a later time. Example 17: Individual A is a Specified U.S. person. Individual A sells a farm property for U.S. $2,000,000. The purchaser pays a 10% deposit (U.S. $200,000) to the real estate agent as security, which the real estate agent deposits into their trust account with Bank X 52 , which is a Reporting NZFI, on behalf of the Individual A (the vendor). The assets of the account, including the income earned thereon, will be paid or otherwise distributed for the benefit of the purchaser or individual A (including to satisfy such person's obligation) when the property is sold. The account is a depository account which exceeds all relevant depository thresholds for reporting. However, Bank X is not required to treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account as it meets the criteria of being an exempt "escrow account" under Annex II (V) (E) of the IGA. Therefore, the account is excluded from the definition of financial account and is not a U.S. Reportable Account. Partner Jurisdiction Accounts 59. The following type of "partner jurisdiction account" is also excluded from the definition of financial account and therefore shall not be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account. That is, an account maintained in New Zealand that is excluded from the definition of financial account under an agreement between the U.S. and another Partner Jurisdiction to facilitate the implementation of FATCA, provided that such account is subject to the same requirements and oversight under the laws of such other Partner Jurisdiction as if such account were established in that Partner Jurisdiction and maintained by a Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution in that Partner Jurisdiction. Example 18: Reporting NZFI writes pension business into Country A, but does not have a permanent establishment there. Reporting NZFI maintains these pension accounts in New Zealand. The U.S. has entered into an IGA with Country A. These accounts are excluded from the definition of financial account under the IGA entered into between the U.S. and Country A. The accounts are subject to the same requirements and oversight under Country A's laws as if the account were established in Country A and maintained by a Country A financial institution in Country A. Therefore, these pension accounts are excluded from the definition of financial account and are not U.S. Reportable Accounts. Tax Pooling Accounts 60. An account that is an interest in a trust established in accordance with section 15S (1)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 by a tax pooling intermediary for the purposes of administering a "tax pooling account" (as defined in section RP 17B of the Income Tax Act 2007) is excluded from the definition of financial account and therefore shall not be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account. What information does a Reporting NZFI need to obtain and report about a U.S. Reportable Account? 61. Article 4(1)(a) of the IGA requires that a Reporting NZFI identifies U.S. Reportable Accounts and reports annually to Inland Revenue the information 53 about such accounts that is required to be reported pursuant to Article (2)(2)(a) of the IGA. 62. The information to be obtained and reported is set out in Article 2(2)(a) as follows: (1) the name, address, and U.S. TIN 54 of each Specified U.S. Person that is an account holder of such account and, in the case of a Non-U.S. Entity that, after application of the due diligence procedures set forth in Annex I of the IGA, is identified as having one or more controlling persons that is a Specified U.S. Person, the name, address, and U.S. TIN (if any) of such entity and each such Specified U.S. Person; (2) the account number (or functional equivalent in the absence of an account number); (3) the name and identifying number of the Reporting NZFI; 52 As required by section 122 of the Real Estates Agents Act 2008. 53 As explained below, the type of information that a Reporting NZFI will need to provide in relation to a U.S. Reportable Account will depend on the relevant reporting year. 54 Please refer to our FATCA recalcitrant guidance (IR1085) dated October 2017 for further detail about how pre-existing recalcitrant accounts should be reported. 16U.S. reportable accounts guidance notes (4) the account balance or value (including, in the case of a cash value insurance contract or annuity contract, the cash value or surrender value) as of the end of the appropriate reporting period (the period ending 31 March of the relevant year) 55 or, if the account was closed during such reporting period, immediately before closure; (5) in the case of any custodial account: 56 (A) the total gross amount of interest, the total gross amount of dividends, and the total gross amount of other income generated with respect to the assets held in the account, in each case paid or credited to the account (or with respect to the account) during the appropriate reporting period (the period ending 31 March of the relevant year); and (B) the total gross proceeds from the sale or redemption of property paid or credited to the account during the appropriate reporting period (the period ending 31 March of the relevant year with respect to which the Reporting NZFI acted as a custodian, broker, nominee, or otherwise as an agent for the account holder; (6) in the case of any depository account, the total gross amount of interest paid or credited to the account during the appropriate reporting period (the period ending 31 March of the relevant year); and (7) in the case of any account not described in sub-paragraphs (1) – (6), the total gross amount paid or credited to the account holder with respect to the account during the reporting period (ending 31 March of the relevant year) with respect to which the Reporting NZFI is the obligor or debtor, including the aggregate amount of any redemption payments made to the account holder during the appropriate reporting period (the period ending 31 March of the relevant year). 63. Reporting NZFIs will need to obtain and report to the Inland Revenue the following information in relation to U.S. Reportable Accounts in order to comply with their obligations pursuant to Article 4(1)(a) of the IGA: • The information set out in Article 2(2)(a)(1)-(4) of the IGA for the 2014 year (the period ending 31 March 2015); 57 • The information set out in Article 2(2)(a)(1)-(7) of the IGA, except for the "gross proceeds" information described above at Article 2(2)(a)(5)(B), for the 2015 year (the period ending 31 March 2016); and • The information set out in paragraphs Article 2(2)(a)(1)-(7) of the IGA for the 2016 year (the period ending 31 March 2017) and subsequent years. In the following paragraphs we discuss two points set out in Article 2(2)(a) of the IGA – "account closures" and the meaning of "paid or credited" – in more detail. These points are relevant to the type of information that Reporting NZFIs will need to provide to Inland Revenue in relation to U.S. Reportable Accounts in order to comply with their obligations pursuant to Article 4(1)(a) of the IGA. Account Closures 64. Article 2(2)(a)(4) of the IGA refers to the information that Reporting NZFIs will need to provide (in order to comply with their obligations in terms of Article 4(1)(a)) in relation to "account closures" for U.S. Reportable Accounts. 65. Where a Reporting NZFI maintains a U.S. Reportable Account that is closed during a reporting period, the Reporting NZFI must provide details of the account balance or value immediately before closure. 66. In recognition of the fact that Reporting NZFIs will have different account closing procedures, a Reporting NZFI will comply with this "account closure" requirement if they provide the following information to Inland Revenue in relation to such accounts \[The intention of the different options is to capture the amount withdrawn as part of the account closure process, as opposed to the amount at the point of closure, given that there is an expectation that the balance of an account will be reduced prior to the point of closure. Additionally, a Reporting NZFI has the option to report the balance or value of an account on receipt of account closing instructions as a proxy date for "immediately before closure"\]: • The balance or value of an account when the Reporting NZFI receives instructions from the account holder to close the account; • The most recent available balance or value that is obtainable following receipt of instructions from an account holder to close the account, where the Reporting NZFI is unable to record the balance or value at the time of receiving instructions to close the account. This may include a balance or value that predates the closure instructions, if that is the balance or value most readily available; or • The balance or value of the account on any of the five business days prior to account closure. Example 19: A Reporting NZFI receives instructions from a customer to close a depository account on Monday. The Reporting NZFI is able to determine the account balance at the time of receiving the account closure instructions. However, internal procedures result in the account being closed on the following Wednesday. The balance of the depository account on Monday prior to the actual closure of the account is the reportable balance in terms of Article 2(2)(a)(4) of the IGA (where the Reporting NZFI chooses to record the account closure balance as at the time of receiving the account closure instructions). 55 Section 185M of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the appropriate reporting period that the information must relate to is the period ending 31 March of the relevant year (a tax year). 56 The fact that Article 2 of the IGA (which, as noted above, relates to the obligations of Reporting NZFIs pursuant to Article 4(1)(a) of the IGA) distinguishes between various types of accounts highlights how Reporting NZFIs will need to consider what type of account a U.S. Reportable Account is (i.e. whether it is a custodial account or a depository account etc) in order to comply with their responsibilities pursuant to Article 4(1)(a) of the IGA. 57 Section 185M of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the relevant period that the information must relate to is the period ended 31 March. 17U.S. reportable accounts guidance notes Amounts Paid or Credited 67. Article 2(2)(a)(5)-(7) of the IGA refers to information that Reporting NZFIs will need to provide (in order to comply with their obligations in terms of Article 4(1)(a)) relating to certain amounts "paid or credited" to U.S. Reportable Accounts that they maintain. 68. It is common for income from a financial account to be paid to or credited to a different account from which the capital is held. Reporting NZFIs should report on all amounts of gross income or proceeds from the sale or redemption of property, irrespective of which account of the account holder, those amounts are paid or credited into. 69. The expression "paid" is not defined in the IGA. However, the expression "pay" is defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to include in part, to deal with an amount in a person's "interest or on their behalf". This would include payments of income and gross proceeds to any account of an account holder. Further support in the IGA for this interpretation can be found in Article 2(2)(a)(5)(A) of the IGA, which refers to amounts being "paid or credited to the account (or with respect to the account" (emphasis added). An amount paid to an account holder in regard to a U.S. Reportable Account, but paid to another account of the account holder by a Reporting NZFI, would be an amount paid in respect of the U.S. Reportable Account.

The New Zealand Government signed an Intergovernmental Agreement (“IGA”) with the United States (“U.S.”) on 12 June 2014 and the relevant enabling legislation was passed on 30 June 2014, effective from 1 July 2014. The IGA has been brought into effect by Order in Council and came into force on 3 July 2014. The IGA was entered into for the purpose of implementing FATCA in New Zealand. 2. A collective investment vehicle, such as a unit trust, that pools funds on behalf of investors can be a financial institution for FATCA purposes. If such a vehicle carries on business in New Zealand (or is managed in New Zealand) it will often be a Reporting New Zealand financial institution (“Reporting NZFI”) 1 and have FATCA obligations. 3. The purpose of these guidance notes is to provide some practical examples setting out how FATCA will apply to New Zealand collective investment vehicles and to explain what FATCA obligations such entities will have. This will provide some further context to Inland Revenue's “registration”, “due diligence”, and “reportable accounts” guidance notes in terms of how the principles referred to in those notes will apply in practice to collective investment vehicles. What is a collective investment vehicle? 4. A collective investment vehicle is an entity that pools funds on behalf of investors for investment purposes. This would include the following (non-exhaustive) types of entities: • Unit trusts; • Group investment funds; • Superannuation schemes; and • Entities providing participating securities. 5. A “managed investment scheme” subject to section 9 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (which would cover, for example, entities such as unit trusts and superannuation schemes) would also be a “collective investment vehicle.” The references in these guidance notes to “collective investment vehicles” should be read as covering such entities. 6. A collective investment vehicle will come within the definition of “investment entity” in Article 1(1)(j) of the IGA, and, therefore, will be a financial institution under Article 1(1)(g) of the IGA because of: • The business activities that it carries out (the collective pooling of funds and investing, administering, or managing of funds or money on behalf of investors); or • The fact that it is managed by an investment entity (such as a trustee/investment manager) that carries on investment activities for the collective investment vehicle such that the vehicle would be a deemed investment entity. 7. Therefore, collective investment vehicles that carry on such activities in New Zealand (or are managed in this way) will be New Zealand financial institutions (“NZFIs”) for FATCA purposes. However, the key FATCA issue is whether such NZFIs will have FATCA due diligence obligations and, if so, what the nature of those obligations will be. As explained below, this will depend on the facts. Will New Zealand collective investment vehicles have FATCA obligations? 8. A New Zealand collective investment vehicle will need to consider whether it is a: • Reporting NZFI; or • Non-Reporting NZFI. 1 However, as explained below, a New Zealand collective investment vehicle (that would otherwise be a Reporting NZFI) may, for instance, be able to apply the trustee documented trust or sponsored investment entity provisions in the IGA so that the trustee or sponsor carries out FATCA due diligence and reporting on behalf of the trust/sponsored entity. If this occurs, the New Zealand collective investment vehicle would be a Non-Reporting NZFI. These matters are explained in detail below. 4Application of FATCA to collective investment vehicles 9. This “categorisation” issue will drive whether such collective investment vehicles have FATCA obligations and the nature of any such obligations. Reporting NZFIs have FATCA obligations. Non-Reporting NZFIs will generally have no or limited FATCA obligations. The meaning of Reporting NZFI and Non-Reporting NZFI 2 is set out in detail in Inland Revenue's “registration” guidance notes. 10. New Zealand collective investment vehicles will often 3 be Reporting NZFIs and, therefore, have FATCA due diligence and reporting obligations. However, these guidance notes will now briefly set out the circumstances when such vehicles will be Non- Reporting NZFIs. When will a collective investment vehicle be a non- reporting New Zealand financial institution? 11. As explained in Inland Revenue's “registration” guidance notes, a NZFI, such as a New Zealand collective investment vehicle, will be a Non-reporting NZFI if it is an exempt beneficial owner or deemed compliant financial institution pursuant to the U.S. Treasury Regulations, or is described in Annex II of the IGA as a Non-reporting NZFI (exempt beneficial owner or deemed compliant financial institution that is a Non-Reporting NZFI) 4 . The significance of this is that, as noted above, a collective investment vehicle that is a Non-Reporting NZFI will generally have no or limited FATCA obligations. 12. A NZFI is entitled to rely on either the U.S. Treasury Regulations or Annex II of the IGA to determine whether they are an exempt beneficial owner or deemed compliant. A NZFI is not required to obtain permission from the Inland Revenue to adopt the U.S. Treasury Regulation definitions in these circumstances. U.S. Treasury Regulations 13. In the U.S. Treasury Regulations the types of exempt beneficial owner categories that could potentially apply to a particular New Zealand collective investment vehicle are: 5 • Treaty-qualified retirement fund: A fund which is operated principally to administer or provide pension or retirement funds, where that fund is entitled to benefits (or would be entitled to such benefits if it derived such income) under the New Zealand/United States Double Tax Convention on income sourced from the U.S. • Broad participation retirement fund: A fund established to provide retirement, disability, or death benefits to current or former employees (or other designated person) for services rendered. Among the other criteria is that no single beneficiary has a more than 5% right to the fund's assets. • Narrow participation retirement fund: A fund established to provide retirement, disability, or death benefits to current or former employees (or other designated person) for services rendered. Among the other criteria is that that fund has fewer than 50 participants and employee and employer contributions to the fund are limited by reference to earned income and compensation of the employee. • A fund formed pursuant to a plan similar to a section 401(a) plan: 6 a type of retirement fund related to section 401(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. • Investment vehicle established exclusively to earn income for certain retirement funds: A fund established to earn income for a retirement fund or a retirement of pension account described in the U.S. Treasury Regulations. • Pension fund of an exempt beneficial owner: A fund established and sponsored by an exempt beneficial owner (foreign government, international organisation, central bank or government of a U.S. territory) to provide retirement, disability, or death benefits to current or former employees of the exempt beneficial owner (or persons designated by such employees), or that are not current or former employees, but the benefits are provided in regard to personal services performed for the exempt beneficial owner. 2 Non-reporting NZFIs will need to monitor compliance with the criteria for non-reporting status on an on- going basis. Additionally, the non-reporting criteria could include reporting to Inland Revenue in certain situations. These criteria and the reporting requirements that such Non-reporting NZFIs could have (depending on the circumstances) are set out in detail in Inland Revenue's “registration” guidance notes. 3 However, as explained below, a New Zealand collective investment vehicle may be able to apply the trustee documented trust or sponsored investment entity provisions in the IGA so that the trustee or sponsor carries out FATCA due diligence and reporting behalf of the trust/sponsored entity. If this occurs, the New Zealand collective investment vehicle would be a Non-Reporting NZFI. 4 Refer to the definition of “Non-Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution” in Article 1(1)(q) of the IGA. 5 The following is a broad summary. These definitions are set out in full in the U.S. Treasury Regulations and are elaborated on Inland Revenue’s “registration” guidance notes. 6 Internal Revenue Code. 5Application of FATCA to collective investment vehicles 14. In the U.S. Treasury Regulations the types of deemed compliant financial institution categories that could apply to a particular New Zealand collective investment vehicle are: • Local FFI: This includes certain locally focused FFIs that are licensed and regulated as a financial institution under the laws of its country of incorporation or organization (which must be a FATF compliant jurisdiction at the time the FFI registers for deemed-compliant status), do not have a fixed place of business outside its country of incorporation or organization, do not solicit customers or account holders outside its country of incorporation or organization, and that comply with the various due diligence and procedural requirements set out in the U.S. Treasury Regulations. A local FFI can be any type of financial institution e.g. a depository institution, custodial institution, investment entity or insurance company. This local FFI “exception” is intended to have a narrow scope because of the requirement that there be a minimum of 98% New Zealand resident account holders by value. The local FFI exception is not intended to apply to FFIs that serve a significant number of non-resident account holders. • Qualified collective investment vehicle: The primary purpose of this category is to provide relief for certain investment entities that are owned solely through participating FFIs or directly by large institutional investors, payments to which would not be subject to withholding or reporting under Chapter 4 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (as referred to in the U.S. Treasury Regulations). The entity also needs to comply with certain procedural requirements set out in the U.S. Treasury Regulations. The types of investors that are permitted in such an entity include certain retirement plans and certain non- profit organizations. • Restricted fund: The primary purpose of this category is to cover certain funds that are “restricted” in the sense that they only target “foreign” (in relation to the United States) investors and comply with the procedural requirements set out in the U.S. Treasury Regulations. Various aspects of this category have now been amended as set out in the US Treasury document TD 9657. 7 For example, the U.S. Treasury Regulations have now removed the requirement that the restricted fund certify to the IRS. • Sponsored investment entity: This category covers certain sponsored investment entities that are FFIs for which the sponsoring entity agrees to perform all due diligence, withholding, reporting, and other requirements the sponsored FFI would have been required to perform if it were a participating FFI, and complies with certain other requirements. One of the reasons for this category was that in many cases it may be preferable for a trustee or fund manager to perform the due diligence and reporting for all of its investment entities which it manages on a consolidated basis. Various aspects of this category have now been amended as set out in the U.S. Treasury document TD 9657. 8 For example, the U.S. Treasury Regulations now clarify that a sponsoring entity will not be jointly and severally liable for the sponsored FFI's obligations unless the sponsoring entity is also a withholding agent that is separately liable for such obligations. • Sponsored, closely held investment vehicle: this category covers sponsored closely held investment vehicles, which are sponsored by a sponsoring FFI. • Limited life debt investment entity (“LLDIE”): This category covers certain FFIs (that are the beneficial owner of the payments made in respect of an account) that are collective investment vehicles formed pursuant to a trust indenture or similar fiduciary arrangement and satisfy other criteria. Various aspects of this category have now been amended as set out in the U.S. Treasury document TD 9657. 9 The changes in the U.S. Treasury Regulations include: (i) removing the requirement that a LLDIE's organizational documents cannot be amended without the consent of all of its investors; (ii) clarifying that a LLDIE issues debt or equity interests under a trust indenture or similar agreement; (iii) extending the category so that it applies to a LLDIE that issued all of its interests on or before January 17, 2013 (for example, the date that the final regulations were filed); (iv) allowing a LLDIE to be treated as a certified deemed-compliant FFI until the LLDIE liquidates or terminates; (v) removing the requirement that investors be unrelated to each other; and (vi) expanding the types of assets that the entity can hold and still qualify as a LLDIE. • Owner-documented FFI: This category covers certain entities that are FFIs solely because they are investment entities. Among the other criteria are: - The FFI is not owned by or in an expanded affiliated group with any FFI that is a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company; - The FFI does not maintain a financial account for any non-participating FFI; - The FFI provides the designated withholding agent with all of the relevant information (set out in the U.S. Treasury Regulations) and agrees to notify the withholding agent if there is a change in circumstances; and - The designated withholding agent agrees to report to the IRS all of the relevant information (as set out in the U.S Treasury Regulations). 7 http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Documents/FATCA.pdf 8 http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Documents/FATCA.pdf 9 http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Documents/FATCA.pdf 6Application of FATCA to collective investment vehicles 15. These definitions from the U.S. Treasury Regulations are explained in detail in Inland Revenue's “registration” guidance notes. We note that these definitions are very prescriptive and a New Zealand collective investment vehicle may not be able to satisfy all of the relevant criteria within the relevant type. Instead, it is more likely that a New Zealand collective investment vehicle may be able to come within a type set out in Annex II of the IGA (set out below). Therefore, the examples in these guidance notes will (to the extent that they raise questions of whether a particular New Zealand collective investment vehicle is a Non-Reporting NZFI) focus on parts of Annex II of the IGA that are most likely to be relevant to New Zealand collective investment vehicles. Annex II of the IGA 16. In Annex II of the IGA the types of exempt beneficial owner categories that could potentially apply to a particular New Zealand collective investment vehicle are: • Treaty-qualified retirement fund (section II(A) of Annex II): set out on broadly similar terms as the corresponding type of exempt beneficial owner in the U.S. Treasury Regulations. • Broad participation retirement fund (section II(B) of Annex II): set out on broadly similar terms as the corresponding type of exempt beneficial owner in the U.S. Treasury Regulations. • Narrow participation retirement fund (section II(C) of Annex II): set out on broadly similar terms as the corresponding type of exempt beneficial owner in the U.S. Treasury Regulations. • Pension fund of exempt beneficial owner (section II(D) of Annex II): set out on broadly similar terms as the corresponding type of exempt beneficial owner in the U.S. Treasury Regulations. • Investment entity wholly owned by exempt beneficial owners (section II(E) of Annex II): An entity that is a NZFI solely because it is an investment entity, provided that each direct holder of an equity interest in the entity is an exempt beneficial owner, and each direct holder of a debt interest in such entity is either a depository institution (with respect to a loan made to such Entity) or an exempt beneficial owner. 17. In Annex II of the IGA the types of deemed compliant financial institution categories that could potentially apply to a particular New Zealand collective investment vehicle are: • Financial institution with a local client base (section III(A) of Annex II): Set out on broadly similar terms as the “local FFI” type of deemed compliant FFI in the U.S. Treasury Regulations. However, two key differences are that (a) the 98% test for the holding of financial accounts applies to residents of New Zealand or Australia; and (b) the financial institution needs to be licensed or regulated as a financial institution under the laws of New Zealand (i.e. the financial institution does not need to be licensed and regulated under the laws of New Zealand); • Trustee-documented trust (section IV(A) of Annex II): A trust established under the laws of New Zealand to the extent that the trustee of the trust is a Reporting U.S Financial Institution, Reporting Model 1 FFI, or Participating FFI and reports all information required to be reported pursuant to the Agreement with respect to all U.S Reportable Accounts of the trust; • Sponsored investment entity (section IV(B) of Annex II): Set out on broadly similar terms to the corresponding category in the U.S. Treasury Regulations. The “sponsored” entity in this category needs to be a New Zealand investment entity that is not a qualified intermediary, withholding foreign partnership, or withholding foreign trust pursuant to relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations and that has a “sponsoring” entity that: (i) is authorised to act on behalf of the sponsored entity to fulfil applicable FATCA registration requirements; (ii) has registered as a sponsoring entity for FATCA purposes; (iii) if they identify any U.S. Reportable Accounts with respect to the sponsored entity, registers the sponsored entity on or before the later of 31 December 2015 and the date that is 90 days after such a U.S. Reportable Account is first identified ; (iv) agrees to perform on behalf of the sponsored entity all due diligence, withholding, reporting, and other FATCA requirements; (v) identifies the sponsored entity and includes the identification number 10 of the sponsored entity in all reporting; and (vi) has not had its status as a sponsor revoked. • Sponsored closely held investment vehicle (section IV(C) of Annex II): Set out on broadly similar terms as the corresponding category in the U.S. Treasury Regulations; and • Collective investment vehicle (section IV(E) of Annex II): Broadly covers investment entities established in New Zealand and regulated as a collective investment vehicle provided that all of the interests in the vehicle (including debt interests in excess of US $50,000) are held by or through one or more exempt beneficial owners, active NFFEs, U.S. Persons that are not Specified U.S. Persons, or financial institutions that are not Non-Participating Financial Institutions. 18. We note that, as is the case with the definitions in the U.S. Treasury Regulations, these definitions in Annex II of the IGA are prescriptive and a New Zealand collective investment vehicle may not be able to satisfy all of the relevant criteria within the relevant type of exempt beneficial owner or deemed compliant financial institution. However, we have set out below practical examples (of how FATCA will apply to collective investment vehicles in New Zealand) which incorporate a number of these types of exempt beneficial owner or deemed compliant financial institution (Treaty-Qualified retirement funds, deemed compliant collective investment vehicles, 11 trustee documented trusts, and sponsored investment entities) that are likely to be most applicable in a New Zealand context. 10 The reference to “identification number” means the Global Intermediary Identification Number (“GIIN”) of the financial institution. 11 A collective investment scheme coming within section IV(E) of Annex II of the IGA. 7Application of FATCA to collective investment vehicles 19. We have focused the following examples on KiwiSaver funds, unit trusts, and circumstances where investments are held through custodians. This is because these are common structuring arrangements that will have wide application to the managed funds industry in New Zealand. Practical examples of how fatca will apply to collective investment vehicles in New Zealand Example 1: Treaty qualified retirement funds in section II(A) of Annex II of the IGA KiwiSaver scheme fund is a KiwiSaver scheme registered under the KiwiSaver Act 2006. KiwiSaver scheme fund has mostly New Zealand resident members. Does KiwiSaver scheme fund have any FATCA due diligence and reporting obligations? 20. No. Annex II of the IGA provides that a “Treaty Qualified Retirement Fund” is an exempt beneficial owner that is a Non-Reporting NZFI. Such funds will not have any FATCA due diligence and reporting obligations. 21. A “Treaty Qualified Retirement Fund” is defined as being any pension fund established in New Zealand and described in Article 3(1)(l) (General Definitions) of the U.S./New Zealand Convention, provided that the pension fund is entitled to benefits under the Convention on income that it derives from sources within the U.S. (or would be entitled to such benefits if it derived any such income) as a resident of New Zealand that satisfies any applicable limitation on benefits requirement. 22. Any KiwiSaver scheme registered under the KiwiSaver Act 2006 or superannuation scheme registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989, that has mostly New Zealand resident members, would be fall within the scope of “Treaty–Qualified Retirement Funds” in section II(A) of Annex II of the IGA and therefore be treated as an exempt beneficial owner that is a Non- Reporting NZFI. 23. KiwiSaver scheme fund is registered under the KiwiSaver Act 2006. The fund also has mostly New Zealand resident members. Therefore, KiwiSaver scheme fund would be a Treaty Qualified Retirement Fund (exempt beneficial owner) that is a Non- Reporting NZFI. The fund would not need to register with the IRS and would not have any FATCA due diligence or reporting obligations. Example 2: Collective Investment Vehicles in section IV(E) of Annex II of the IGA Fund A is a New Zealand investment entity (financial institution) that is a pooled investment vehicle for large institutional investors. Fund A is regulated in relation to its activities. The investors in Fund A are a New Zealand Government entity (an exempt beneficial owner under the IGA) and various New Zealand unit trusts. All of the unit trust account holders in Fund A are financial institutions that are not Non-Participating financial institutions. No other entities hold an interest in Fund A. Example 2: Diagram Account Holder: 1 Government Entity Account Holder: 2 Unit Trust Account Holder: 3 Unit Trust Fund A Does Fund A have any FATCA due diligence and reporting obligations? 24. Fund A would fall within the scope of the “Collective Investment Vehicle” category in section IV(E) of Annex II of the IGA. This is because all of the interest holders in Fund A are either exempt beneficial owners or financial institutions that are not Non- Participating financial institutions. Therefore, Fund A would be a deemed compliant financial institution that is a Non- Reporting NZFI with no FATCA due diligence or reporting obligations. 25. However, it is important to note that Fund A is only a deemed compliant financial institution because of the precise nature of its investors. This is subject to change. For instance, one of the unit trusts (that invest in Fund A) may become a Non- participating financial institution. If this was the case, Fund A would no longer be able to come within this particular category of deemed compliant financial institution. 8Application of FATCA to collective investment vehicles Example 3: Unit Trust with a Custodian 26. Fund B is a New Zealand unit trust that is a pooled investment vehicle for investors. Fund B is a financial institution solely because it is an investment entity and will be a Reporting NZFI (unless, for example, it applies the trustee documented trust or the sponsored investment entity provisions in Annex II of the IGA - explained below). Fund B has a New Zealand trustee and a New Zealand fund manager (both are investment entities that are Reporting NZFIs). Custodian Limited holds the fund’s property on trust (and as custodian) for Fund B. Custodian Limited is a custodial institution that is a Reporting NZFI. Investors receive units in Fund B in return for their investments and Fund B uses the pooled funds to invest in various debt and equity interests. Custodian Limited holds this property on trust (and as custodian) for Fund B. The interests in Fund B are not regularly traded on an established securities market and these interests are not excluded accounts. Example 3: Diagram Investor 2: Nominee for Company D Account Holder 4 Fund B (Unit trust): Receives funds from investors (in return for units) that are invested in equities/debt instruments Account Holder 3 Account Holder 1: Fund C Company D Investor Investor Investor NZ Fund Manager NZ Tr u s t e e Custodian Limited: holds investments in equities/debt instruments on trust for Fund B Debt Co 2 Debt Co 1 Equity Co 2 Equity Co 1 Does Fund B have any FATCA obligations? 27. Fund B is a Reporting NZFI (unless it applies the trustee documented trust or the sponsored investment entity provisions in Annex II of the IGA – explained below) 12 and the interests of the unit holder account holders are financial accounts in Fund B. This means that Fund B 13 will need to carry out FATCA due diligence on these accounts to determine whether there are any U.S. Reportable Accounts and whether any of the accounts are held by non-participating financial institutions. If Fund B identifies any such accounts, it will need to report them to Inland Revenue. Does Custodian Limited have any FATCA obligations? 28. Custodian Limited is a Reporting NZFI. Custodian Limited maintains a custodial account (holding the underlying debt/equity interests) for Fund B. Fund B (a financial institution) is the relevant account holder (see the definition of “account holder” in Article 1(1)(dd) of the IGA, which does not require “tracing through” a financial institution) of that custodial account. Therefore, as the account is held by a financial institution (Fund B), the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account. This means that, provided that Fund B has not been treated by the IRS as a non-participating financial institution, Custodian Limited will not have any further FATCA due diligence obligations (beyond determining that the account holder – Fund B – is a financial institution) and will not need to report the account. Custodian Limited would be able to check the IRS list of non-participating financial institutions to determine whether Fund B is a non-participating financial institution in this respect. Example 4: Unit Trust that uses the “trustee documented trust” category in section IV(A) of Annex II of the IGA 29. The facts are the same as example 3. However, Fund B wants to use the trustee documented trust category in section IV(A) of Annex II of the IGA, so that the trustee can carry out FATCA due diligence and reporting on its behalf. Can Fund B do this? 30. Yes. The trustee documented trust category can be used by New Zealand investment entities that have a trustee that is a Reporting U.S. Financial Institution, Reporting Model 1 FFI, or Participating FFI and reports all information required to be reported pursuant to the IGA with respect to all U.S. Reportable Accounts of the trust. 31. The trustee of Fund B is a Reporting NZFI (a Reporting Model 1 FFI). Fund B is also an investment entity. Fund B will be using the trustee to carry out FATCA due diligence and reporting on its behalf. Fund B will be able to be a trustee documented trust deemed compliant FFI that is a Non-Reporting NZFI provided that the trustee reports all information required to be reported pursuant to the IGA with respect to all U.S. Reportable Accounts of Fund B. If Fund B is a trustee documented trust it will not need to register with the IRS. 12 It is assumed for the purposes of this example that none of the other types of Non-Reporting NZFI apply to Fund B. 13 Fund B will need to be registered with the IRS if it is a Reporting NZFI. As explained below, Fund B would also need to be registered if it is a sponsored investment entity and the “sponsor” identifies that Fund B maintains any U.S. Reportable Accounts. 9Application of FATCA to collective investment vehicles Example 5: Unit trust with an investor that is a Financial Institution 32. The facts are the same as example 4. However, the trustee of Fund B has now carried out FATCA due diligence on financial accounts maintained by Fund B and has determined that one of the account holders (Fund C) is a collective investment scheme (with a trustee that is a Reporting NZFI) that is a NZFI. The balance of Fund C’s account is above the threshold exemptions for entity accounts. Does the Trustee of Fund B need to report on the account held by Fund C? 33. Fund C is a NZFI. This means that the account that Fund B maintains that is held by Fund C is not a U.S. Reportable Account. Therefore, the trustee of Fund B will only need to report payments to the account held by Fund C if Fund C has been treated by the IRS as a non-participating financial institution. Fund B will be able to look at the IRS list of non-participating financial institutions to determine whether Fund C is a non-participating financial institution in this regard. Does the Trustee of Fund B need to carry out any FATCA due diligence on Fund C’s underlying investors? 34. No. Fund C is the relevant account holder (of the account that Fund B maintains). As noted above, the definition of “account holder” in Article 1(1)(dd) of the IGA is clear that there is no need for the trustee of Fund B to trace through Fund C (which is an NZFI), to the underlying investors in Fund C. 35. Instead, it is Fund C that would (unless it is a Non-Reporting NZFI with no FATCA due diligence and reporting obligations) need to carry out FATCA due diligence on its own account holders (i.e. the investors that invest in Fund C). Example 6: Unit trust with an individual investor that is identified as being a nominee 36. The facts are the same as example 4. However, the trustee of Fund B has now carried out FATCA due diligence on financial accounts maintained by Fund B and has determined that one of the investors in the fund is an individual nominee that holds their interest on behalf of an underlying company (Company D). The balance of this account is above the threshold exemptions for entity accounts. “Who” is the relevant account holder of this interest? 37. The trustee of Fund B has identified that the individual nominee merely holds the interest as nominee for Company D. The definition of “account holder” in Article 1(1)(dd) of the IGA requires a tracing through of nominees that are not financial institutions. The individual nominee is not an entity and is not a financial institution. Therefore, Company D is the relevant account holder. The trustee of Fund B will need to apply the entity due diligence procedures to determine if the account is a U.S. Reportable Account (i.e. if Company D is a Specified US Person or a passive NFFE with US Controlling persons) or held by a non-participating financial institution. If the trustee of Fund B identifies that the account is a U.S. Reportable Account or that the account is held by a non-participating financial institution it will need to report the account. Example 7: Unit trust with a sponsoring entity 38. The facts are the same as example 3. However, Fund B wants to use the fund manager (an investment entity that is a Reporting NZFI and that is not a qualified intermediary, withholding foreign partnership, or withholding foreign trust) to conduct its FATCA due diligence/reporting on its behalf - as a “sponsoring” entity. The fund manager: • Is authorised to act on behalf of Fund B (as sponsoring entity) to fulfil applicable FATCA registration requirements and agrees to perform on behalf of Fund B, all due diligence, withholding, reporting, and other FATCA requirements and carries on such activities; • Has registered as a sponsoring entity with the IRS; • Will register Fund B for FATCA purposes if they identify any U.S. Reportable accounts with respect to Fund B (on or before the later of December 31, 2015 and the date that is 90 days after such a U.S. Reportable Account is first identified); • Identifies Fund B and includes the identification number \[The reference to “identification number” means the Global Intermediary Identification Number (“GIIN”) of the financial institution\] of Fund B in all FATCA reporting on behalf of Fund B; and • Has not had its status as a sponsor revoked. 10Application of FATCA to collective investment vehicles Example 7: Diagram Investor 2: Nominee for Company D Account Holder 4 Fund B (Unit trust): Receives funds from investors (in return for units) that are invested in equities/debt instruments Account Holder 3 Account Holder 1: Fund C Company D Investor Investor Investor NZ Fund Manager NZ Tr u s t e e Custodian Limited: holds investments in equities/debt instruments on trust for Fund B Debt Co 2 Debt Co 1 Equity Co 2 Equity Co 1 Is the fund manager able to be a “sponsoring” entity for Fund B and, if so, how would this work in practice? 39. Yes. 14 The requirements set out in the sponsored investment entity category in section IV(B) of Annex II of the IGA are all satisfied. Therefore, Fund B will be a sponsored investment entity and will be a deemed compliant FFI that is a Non- reporting financial institution. 15 However, as noted above, if fund manager identifies any U.S. Reportable Accounts with respect to Fund B they will need to register Fund B (on or before the later of 31 December 2015 and the date that is 90 days after such a U.S. Reportable Account is first identified) and report such accounts. From a reporting perspective it will be essential that the fund manager identifies Fund B and includes the identification number (GIIN) of Fund B in all reporting to Inland Revenue. Example 8: Managed fund with multiple investment entities that assist in running the fund 40. A New Zealand managed fund (Fund F) 16 is a trust that receives investments from a number of individual and entity investors. The investors obtain interests in Fund F. The fund then uses this money to invest in various investments in securities. Fund F is a financial institution solely because it is an investment entity. Fund F will be a Reporting NZFI (unless it applies the trustee documented trust or the sponsored investment entity provision in Annex II of the IGA – explained below). 17 The interests in Fund F are not regularly traded on an established securities market and these interests are not excluded accounts. Fund F utilises the following New Zealand Reporting investment entities to assist it in running the fund: Trustee Co, Investment Management Co, Transfer Agent Co, and Fund Manager Co. Example 8: Diagram Account Holder: 1 Individual Account Holder: 2 Individual Account Holder: 3 Entity Fund F Account Holder:4 Entity Transfer Agent Co Fund Manager Co Tr u s t e e C o Investment Management Co Which entity has the obligation to carry out FATCA due diligence and reporting on the individual and entity investors? 41. The interests of the account holders are in Fund F. Therefore, it is Fund F that will (unless, for instance, it is a trustee documented trust or sponsored investment entity – discussed below) have obligations to carry out FATCA due diligence and reporting on these account holders. None of the other entities will have obligations to carry out FATCA due diligence and reporting in relation to these interests (if Fund F carries on such FATCA due diligence and reporting). 14 A “sponsor” of a sponsored investment entity could be, for instance, a fund manager, trustee, corporate director, or managing partner. 15 Therefore, Fund B would be in a similar situation as if it had of utilised the trustee documented trust provision in section IV(A) of Annex II of the IGA. However, there are some differences. As noted above, there can be a requirement for sponsored investment entities to be registered with the IRS. In contrast, trustee documented trusts will not need to register with the IRS. 16 It is assumed for the purposes of this example that Fund F is not an entity described in section IV(E) or (F)(2) of Annex II of the IGA. 17 It is assumed for the purposes of this example that none of the other types of Non-Reporting NZFI apply to Fund F. 11Application of FATCA to collective investment vehicles 42. Transfer Agent Co, Fund Manager Co, Trustee Co and Investment Management Co are all investment entities. They all potentially could have reporting obligations withrespect of Fund F’s account holders, through their business relationship with FundF. Because of that relationship Fund F’s account holders could also be account holders in these other investment entities. The Special Rule in section IV(F)(3) of Annex II of the IGA is intended to avoid the potential for duplicative reporting in these circumstances. Where Fund F reports on its account holders, the reporting obligations of all other investment entities (Transfer Agent Co, Fund Manager Co, Trustee Co and Investment Management Co) with respect to such interests are treated as “deemed fulfilled”. 43. Fund F could take advantage of the trustee documented trust provision in section IV(A) of Annex II of the IGA. This would involve Trustee Co (instead of Fund F), which is a Reporting NZFI,18 carrying on such due diligence/reporting with respect to the financial accounts maintained by Fund F. If this occurs, Fund F will be a deemed complaint FFI that is a Non-Reporting NZFI and will not have any FATCA obligations. The reporting obligations of all the other investment entities (Transfer Agent Co, Fund Manager Co, Trustee Co and Investment Management Co) with respect to such interest would be treated as “deemed fulfilled”. 44. Fund F could also, in the alternative, arrange to be a sponsored investment entity (along the lines of the sponsoring arrangement in example 7), with potentially any of Transfer Agent Co, Fund Manager Co, Trustee Co, and Investment Management Co being the “sponsoring” entity and reporting on Fund F’s account holders. If this is the case, the reporting obligations of all other investment entities (including Fund F) with respect to such interest would be treated as “deemed fulfilled.” 14 The “trustee documented trust” provision in section IV (A) of Annex II of the IGA will only apply if the trustee is a Reporting NZFI, other Reporting Model 1 FFI, or a participating FFI and reports all information required to be reported pursuant to the IGA with respect to all U.S. Reportable Accounts of the trust.

The guidance focuses on how Reporting NZFIs should report recalcitrant accounts for FATCA purposes; and assumes that the relevant financial account is not exempted or excluded under the IGA (for example, there is generally a U.S. dollar 50,000 threshold exclusion for individual depository accounts). Meaning of recalcitrant account A recalcitrant account holder is any account holder which fails to comply with reasonable requests by the Reporting NZFI that maintains the account for: (a) information that is necessary to determine the account holder’s FATCA status; and/or (b) information that needs to be reported about the account for FATCA purposes. Reporting of recalcitrant accounts The IGA provides that Reporting NZFIs will need to report recalcitrant accounts just like any other U.S. Reportable Account (i.e. treating the account holder or, where applicable, controlling person, 1 as a Specified U.S. Person). This includes the Reporting NZFI reporting the following identity information for these accounts: • the name, address, and U.S. Tax Identification Number (U.S. TIN) of each Specified U.S. Person account holder; and • if the account is held by a passive non-financial foreign entity (passive NFFE), the name, address, and U.S. TIN of each Specified U.S. Person controlling person (along with the account holder’s name, address and U.S. TIN – if any). The Reporting NZFI would also be required to report financial information (such as the balance of the account, and income and payments to the account) about these accounts and other prescribed information, just like any other U.S. Reportable Account. Please refer to Inland Revenue’s FATCA “U.S. Reportable Accounts” guidance notes (IR1083) for further details about the information that Reporting NZFIs need to report for U.S. Reportable Accounts (including such recalcitrant accounts). Importantly, this reportable information includes the account holder’s (or, where applicable, controlling person’s) U.S. TIN. IRS notification that a Reporting NZFI is significantly non-compliant The U.S. has provided guidance 2 that if a FI (which would include a Reporting NZFI) fails to report required U.S. TINs for U.S. Reportable Accounts, the IRS may notify Inland Revenue that the Reporting NZFI has been significantly non-compliant in accordance with the IGA. If the Reporting NZFI remains non-compliant for 18 months after such notification, the U.S. may treat the NZFI as a non-participating financial institution that is subject to 30% withholding. Therefore, if a Reporting NZFI maintains such accounts, but has not already collected the required U.S. TIN information, they should promptly take steps to obtain this information, so that they are in a position to comply with their reporting obligations. Inland Revenue has produced a brochure Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act: provision of US TINs (IR1090), which Reporting NZFIs can use to assist them when making requests for this information. 1 This will apply (i.e. needing to identify controlling persons) if the account holder is a type of entity known as a passive non-financial foreign entity (NFFE). Where a Reporting NZFI has not otherwise been able to determine that an entity account holder is a financial institution, Specified U.S. person, or active NFFE, they should treat the entity account holder (by default) as a passive NFFE. 2 See IRS Notice 2017-46 (at page 5) issued on 25 September 2017 https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-17-46.pdf. 4FATCA recalcitrant account holder guidance Transitional procedures allow additional time for Reporting NZFIs to collect U.S. TINs for recalcitrant pre-existing accounts However, the U.S. has acknowledged 3 that some FIs may need additional time to implement practices and procedures to obtain and report required U.S. TINs for pre-existing accounts (accounts maintained by the Reporting NZFI as of 30 June 2014) that are U.S. Reportable Accounts. With respect to such pre-existing accounts, for the 2017-2019 4 FATCA reporting periods, the IRS will not determine that a Reporting NZFI has been significantly non-compliant solely because of a failure to obtain and report each required U.S. TIN, provided that the Reporting NZFI takes the following steps; if it: • obtains and reports the date of birth of each individual account holder (and any applicable controlling person) whose U.S. TIN is not reported (this information will need to be obtained and reported to Inland Revenue by 30 June 2018 – for the 2017 FATCA period ending 31 March 2018); • requests annually from each account holder any missing U.S. TIN; • before reporting information that relates to the 2017 FATCA period (ending 31 March 2018), it searches electronically searchable data that it maintains for any missing required U.S. TINs that have not previously been reported; and • implements practices and procedures promptly to ensure that U.S. Reportable Accounts are documented and reported in accordance with the IGA in future years. Further guidance • The IRS intends to provide further instructions regarding appropriate electronic reporting for the TIN data element for pre-existing accounts that are U.S. Reportable Accounts, but with missing required U.S. TINs. • We will update this recalcitrant accounts guidance once the IRS has clarified the electronic reporting solution that will apply to such accounts. This will include providing further guidance about how all of the various data elements should be reported if a recalcitrant account holder has not provided the requisite information. 3 See IRS Notice 2017-46 (at page 5), issued on 25 September 2017. 4 The 2017-2019 FATCA reporting periods are references to the calendar year ended 31 December, the  equivalent NZ FATCA reporting periods are the periods to 31 March 2018 – 2020.

The HIRE Act 2010 introduced legislation requiring financial institutions outside of the United States (“U.S.”) to provide details relating to U.S. citizens' financial accounts to the U.S.'s Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). This legislation was subsequently complemented with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) U.S. Treasury Regulations, issued in January 2013. The purpose of FATCA is to reduce and combat tax evasion by U.S. citizens, by requiring certain foreign financial institutions (“FFIs”) to register with the IRS, carry out FATCA due diligence on their financial accounts, and provide details to the IRS about reportable accounts held by U.S. citizens/residents (and certain passive entities that are controlled by U.S. citizens/residents), and non-participating financial Institutions. 2. The Intergovernmental Agreement (“IGA”) between the U.S. and New Zealand to improve international tax compliance and to implement FATCA was signed on 12 June 2014. Accompanying domestic legislation required to give effect in New Zealand to FATCA received Royal Assent on 30 June 2014 and the IGA and the associated domestic legislation have effect from 1 July 2014. The IGA was brought into effect by Order in Council and came into force on 3 July 2014. Under the IGA, certain New Zealand financial institutions will be required to register with the IRS, carry out FATCA due diligence on their financial accounts, and provide information to Inland Revenue annually about accounts that they maintain that are U.S. Reportable accounts or held by non-participating financial institutions. Inland Revenue will then exchange this information with the U.S. The IGA is also reciprocal in nature. The U.S. will exchange information with Inland Revenue about accounts maintained by U.S. financial institutions that are held by New Zealand residents. Introduction 3. This guidance sets out how the Inland Revenue considers FATCA applies in New Zealand to trusts that maintain or hold financial accounts. 4. A trust is an entity that is within the scope of FATCA. An “entity” is defined in Article 1(1)(gg) of the IGA as “a legal person 1 or a legal arrangement such as a trust”. A New Zealand trust 2 is likely to be either a financial institution or a non-financial foreign entity (“NFFE”) for FATCA purposes. \[The circumstances when a New Zealand trust will be a New Zealand financial institution (“NZFI”) are summarised in the chart at paragraph 44 of this guidance. This chart is likely to be particularly relevant to New Zealand family trusts that are seeking to determine their FATCA status. The examples set out at paragraphs 42-43 of this guidance should also provide some useful context to the chart.\] 5. A trust that is a Reporting New Zealand financial institution (“Reporting NZFI”) 3 will be required to register with the IRS and will have FATCA due diligence and reporting obligations under the IGA. Specifically, such trusts will need to carry out due diligence on the accounts that they maintain (that are not exempted or excluded) 4 to determine whether those accounts are U.S. Reportable Accounts held by Specified U.S. Persons or passive NFFEs (a type of passive vehicle that is not a financial institution) with U.S. Controlling Persons 5 . They will need to report such U.S. Reportable Accounts to Inland Revenue. They will also need to report accounts that they maintain that are held by non-participating financial institutions. 6 6. A New Zealand trust that is not a financial institution is likely to be a NFFE. NFFEs do not have FATCA due diligence obligations under the IGA, but may be account holders that are “reported on” for FATCA purposes by the financial institution that maintains the account (i.e. if they are passive NFFE account holders with U.S. Controlling Persons). The reasons why a trust can be an account holder, the circumstances when a trust will be an account holder, and the implications that this will have for Reporting NZFIs that maintain such trust accounts are outlined in detail below. 1 A natural person is not a legal person in this context. Therefore, a natural person cannot be an entity under the IGA. This is consistent with the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition of “entity” which states at §1.1471- 1(b)(35) that the term “entity” means “any person other than an individual”. 2 The phrase “New Zealand trust” is used in this guidance to refer to a trust that is a New Zealand resident (or a New Zealand branch) for FATCA purposes under the IGA. 3 The references in this guidance to “Reporting New Zealand financial institution” should also be read as covering those “Non-Reporting New Zealand financial institutions” that have FATCA due diligence obligations. The types of Non-Reporting New Zealand financial institutions that have some (generally limited) FATCA due diligence obligations are set out in detail in Inland Revenue's FATCA “registration” guidance notes. All of Inland Revenue's FATCA guidance notes are set out on the Important FATCA documents web page, at www.ird.govt.nz/fatca 4 These exemptions and exclusions are outlined in detail in Inland Revenue's FATCA “due diligence” and “reportable accounts” guidance notes. 5 The definitions of “passive NFFE” and “Controlling Persons” are set out in detail below from paragraph 74 under the heading “Determining whether a New Zealand family trust account holder is a passive NFFE with U.S. Controlling Persons.” 6 The trust will need to report (to Inland Revenue) payments that it makes to non-participating financial institutions on an annual basis for 2015 (the FATCA period ended 31 March 2016) and 2016 (the FATCA period ended 31 March 2017): see Article 4(1)(b) of the IGA. The type of payments that will need to be reported are outlined in detail in Inland Revenue's “due diligence” guidance notes. 4Trusts guidance notes 7. This guidance will begin by setting out how trusts can be financial institutions that are NZFIs. This will focus on the investment entity type of financial institution, which is the type of financial institution that is most likely to apply to trusts. The guidance will then outline the FATCA due diligence obligations of Reporting NZFI investment entity trusts. The guidance will then shift focus to how FATCA will apply to trusts that hold accounts with Reporting NZFIs. This will include a framework that Reporting NZFIs that maintain new 7 trust accounts can apply as part of their FATCA due diligence. 8. As part of this analysis, this guidance will outline specifically how FATCA applies to the following types of trust arrangements, which are common forms of trusts in New Zealand: (a) Unit trusts. (b) Family trusts. (c) Trading trusts. (d) Charitable trusts. Inland Revenue will also produce separate guidance on the application of FATCA to Solicitors' trust accounts. A trust can be a “financial institution” 9. A trust is an entity that can (depending on the activities that it carries out or how it is managed) be a financial institution. There are four categories of entities that are financial institutions under the IGA: investment entity, custodial institution, depository institution, and specified insurance company. 8 The category of financial institution that is most likely to apply to trusts is the investment entity category. Therefore, this guidance will focus on the circumstances where a New Zealand trust will be an investment entity NZFI. When a financial institution trust will be a “NZFI” 10. A trust that is a financial institution will, in general terms, only have FATCA due diligence obligations under the IGA if it is a NZFI that is a Reporting NZFI. 9 Therefore, this guidance will now briefly outline the circumstances where a financial institution trust will be a NZFI in the first place. 11. The IGA defines a “New Zealand financial institution” (in this respect) as meaning: • any financial institution “resident” in New Zealand, excluding any branch of such financial institution located outside New Zealand; and • any branch of a financial institution not resident in New Zealand, if such branch is located in New Zealand. When a Financial Institution Trust will be Resident in New Zealand 12. This then raises the question of what the reference to “resident” in New Zealand means in the context of financial institution trusts. In other words, when will a financial institution trust be a New Zealand resident (as contemplated by the IGA) that is a NZFI? As explained below, there are separate rules that apply (in this regard) depending on whether the trust is a unit trust or a trust other than a unit trust. 7 The IGA defines new accounts as being accounts entered into on or after 1 July 2014. 8 These categories are outlined in detail in Inland Revenue's FATCA “registration” guidance notes. 9 Inland Revenue's FATCA “registration” guidance notes set out the principles that will be relevant to determining whether an entity will be either a Reporting NZFI or a Non-Reporting NZFI. As outlined in those guidance notes, Non-Reporting NZFIs can sometimes have some (generally) limited FATCA due diligence obligations. 5Trusts guidance notes 13. The IGA does not define “resident.” Article 1(2) of the IGA provides that: "\[a\]ny term not otherwise defined in this Agreement \[the IGA\] shall, unless the context otherwise requires or the Competent Authorities agree to a common meaning (as permitted by domestic law), have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of the Party applying this Agreement \[the IGA\], any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that Party prevailing over the meaning given to the term under the laws of that Party (Emphasis added)." Unit Trusts 14. Section YD 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA 2007”) provides rules for the residency of companies (including entities which are deemed to be companies for the purposes of the ITA 2007). A unit trust is deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA 2007. The residency rules for companies in section YD 2 of the ITA 2007 should be applied to unit trusts (subject to necessary modification to accommodate the differences in legal formation and governance) to determine whether such trusts are resident in New Zealand under the IGA. Trusts that are not Unit Trusts 15. Trusts that are not unit trusts are not separate legal entities in New Zealand, and thus New Zealand does not have residency rules for income tax purposes for such trusts. 16. The Competent Authorities of the U.S. and New Zealand have entered into a Competent Authority Arrangement (“the Arrangement”) concerning the meaning of the term "resident in New Zealand" that applies to a financial institution that is a trust (other than a "unit trust" which, as noted above, is deemed to be a company for purposes of the ITA 2007). 17. The Arrangement provides that: • prior to April 1, 2017, a trust (other than a unit trust) may rely on any reasonable definition for the term "resident in New Zealand" including, for instance, in the context of a financial institution that is a trust (other than a unit trust), a trust that is established under the laws of New Zealand, whereby the trust is settled, executed, and governed by New Zealand law; and • beginning on or before April 1, 2017, the term "resident in New Zealand" means, in the context of a financial institution that is a trust (other than a unit trust), a trust that has one or more trustees resident in New Zealand for New Zealand income tax purposes at any time during the reporting period, or is managed by a branch of a trustee located in New Zealand provided that the branch of the trustee is subject to regulatory supervision in New Zealand. However, a financial institution that is a trust (other than a unit trust) would not be considered "resident in New Zealand" if the trust is resident in a Partner Jurisdiction or in another jurisdiction that permits the trust to comply with the requirements of a participating FFI under the U.S. Treasury Regulations, and the trust reports all the information required to be reported pursuant to the Partner Jurisdiction's IGA or the U.S. Treasury Regulations, as applicable, with respect to Financial Accounts maintained by the trust. The Arrangement allows financial institution trusts (other than unit trusts) discretion prior to 1 April 2017 to rely on any reasonable definition for the term “resident in New Zealand”, before moving to a prescriptive definition from 1 April 2017. 18. This guidance will now, having outlined how trusts can be NZFIs, set out the circumstances when a trust will be a NZFI investment entity (the category of financial institution that is most likely to apply to trusts). The guidance will then outline the FATCA due diligence and reporting obligations that Reporting NZFI investment entity trusts have. When trust will be a NZFI “investment entity” 19. As noted above, a trust can be an investment entity that is a Reporting NZFI. This then raises the question of when a trust will be an investment entity in the first place. As explained below, the term “investment entity” is defined in both the IGA and the FATCA U.S. Treasury Regulations. 20. There are a number of parts of the IGA that permit “New Zealand” to make decisions regarding choices that NZFIs can make. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (on behalf of New Zealand) has made a decision under Article 4(7) of the IGA to allow NZFIs to use a definition in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations in lieu of a corresponding definition in the IGA, provided that such application would not frustrate the purposes of the IGA. This means that an entity (such as a trust) is able to choose to use the definition of investment entity in the U.S. Treasury Regulations in lieu of the corresponding definition in the IGA to determine its FATCA status, provided that such application would not frustrate the purposes of the IGA. 21. An entity that chooses to use a definition in the U.S. Treasury Regulations (such as the definition of investment entity) in lieu of a corresponding definition in the IGA to determine its FATCA status will, subject to the following, be applying the definition in a way that is consistent with the purposes of the IGA and that does not frustrate the purposes of the IGA: (a) The entity applying a definition in the U.S. Treasury Regulations must adopt the entire definition; (b) The entity which applies a definition in the U.S. Treasury Regulations (such as the definition of investment entity) in lieu of a corresponding definition in the IGA to determine its FATCA entity status, must, if it is an account holder, notify any 6Trusts guidance notes Reporting NZFI in which it holds an account, that it has decided to use a U.S. Treasury Regulations definition. \[The rationale for this “notification” requirement is set out in detail below\]; and (c) The substitution of a U.S Treasury Regulations definition for a corresponding IGA definition does not frustrate the purposes of the IGA. \[The use of such a definition in the U.S. Treasury Regulations is unlikely to frustrate the purposes of the IGA provided that terms (a) and (b) are satisfied\]. 22. As noted above, an entity which applies a definition in the U.S. Treasury Regulations (such as the definition of investment entity) in lieu of a corresponding definition in the IGA to determine its FATCA entity status must notify any Reporting NZFI in which it holds an account that it has elected to use a U.S. Treasury Regulations definition in this way. The rationale for this requirement is that an entity that chooses to use a definition in the U.S. Treasury Regulations (such as the definition of investment entity) in lieu of a corresponding definition in the IGA to determine its status is likely to do so where the circumstances are such that it, therefore, falls outside that definition and is instead an NFFE. Therefore, such decisions will affect the relevant entity's FATCA status. As explained below, this has the potential to cause gaps in FATCA reporting, absent of such a notification requirement. Therefore, to the extent that an entity (such as a trust) chooses to use the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition of investment entity to determine its status and holds an account it will be important that the entity informs the account maintainer (i.e. the bank) that it has used the U.S. Treasury Regulations in this way. This will help ensure that the account maintainer is in a position to determine the account holder's FATCA status in a way that does not lead to underreporting. For example, in the case of an entity that is, as a result of choosing to apply the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition of investment entity, a passive NFFE with U.S. Controlling Persons, a Reporting NZFI account maintainer that is notified of this choice will be in a better position to correctly determine the entity's status. Therefore, this notification process will help ensure that entities are able to use the definition of investment entity in the U.S Treasury Regulations in a way that is consistent with the purposes of the IGA and so aligns with the language in Article 4(7) of the IGA. 23. The Inland Revenue provides the following guidance as to the application of the IGA and U.S. Treasury Regulations definitions of investment entity to assist trusts to make this choice about what definition to use. This guidance will focus on: the key elements of the investment entity definition in the IGA and U.S. Treasury Regulations, the key differences between these definitions, and the circumstances where trusts would be investment entities under these definitions. Definitions of Investment Entity IGA definition of Investment Entity 24. Article 1(1)(j) of the IGA defines an “investment entity” to mean: ...any Entity that conducts as a business (or is managed by an entity that conducts as a business) one or more of the following activities 10 or operations for or on behalf of a customer: (1) trading in money market instruments (cheques, bills, certificates of deposit, derivatives, etc.); foreign exchange; exchange, interest rate and index instruments; transferable securities; or commodity futures trading; (2) individual and collective portfolio management; or (3) otherwise investing, administering, or managing funds or money on behalf of other persons. This subparagraph 1(j) shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with similar language set forth in the definition of “financial institution” in the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations. 25. Therefore, an entity (such as a trust) will be an investment entity under the IGA definition if it carries on (as a business) specified investment activities for or on behalf of a customer (an “in business” investment entity) or is managed by an “in business” investment entity (a “deemed” investment entity). U.S. Treasury Regulations definition of investment entity 26. The definition of investment entity in §1.1471-5(e)(4) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations provides: (4) Investment entity—(i) In general. The term investment entity means any entity that is described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section. (A) The entity primarily conducts as a business one or more of the following activities 11 or operations for or on behalf of a customer— (1) Trading in money market instruments (checks, bills, certificates of deposit, derivatives, etc.); foreign currency; foreign exchange, interest rate, and index instruments; transferable securities; or commodity futures; 10 For the purposes of this guidance such activities will be referred to as being “specified investment activities”. 11 For the purposes of this guidance such activities will be referred to as being “specified investment activities”. 7Trusts guidance notes (2) Individual or collective portfolio management; or (3) Otherwise investing, administering, or managing funds, money, or financial assets on behalf of other persons. (B) The entity's gross income is primarily attributable to investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets (as defined in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section) and the entity is managed by another entity that is described in paragraph (e)(1) (i), (ii), (iv), or (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section. 12 For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B), an entity is managed by another entity if 13 the managing entity performs, either directly or through another third- party service provider, any of the activities described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section on behalf of the managed entity. (C) The entity functions or holds itself out as a collective investment vehicle, mutual fund, exchange traded fund, private equity fund, hedge fund, venture capital fund, leveraged buyout fund, or any similar investment vehicle established with an investment strategy of investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets. (ii) Financial assets. For purposes of this paragraph, the term financial asset means a security (as defined in section 475(c)(2) without regard to the last sentence thereof), partnership interest, commodity (as defined in section 475(e)(2)), notional principal contract (as defined in §1.446-3(c)), insurance contract or annuity contract, or any interest (including a futures or forward contract or option) in a security, partnership interest, commodity, notional principal contract, insurance contract, or annuity contract. (iii) Primarily conducts as a business— (A) In general. An entity is treated as primarily conducting as a business one or more of the activities described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section if the entity's gross income attributable to such activities equals or exceeds 50 percent of the entity's gross income during the shorter of— 14 (1) The three-year period ending on December 31 of the year preceding the year in which the determination is made; or (2) The period during which the entity has been in existence. (B) Special rule for start-up entities An entity with no operating history as of the date of the determination is treated as primarily conducting as a business one or more of the activities described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section if such entity expects to meet the gross income threshold described in paragraph (e)(4)(iii)(A) of this section based on its anticipated functions, assets, and employees, with due consideration given to any purpose or functions for which the entity is licensed or regulated (including those of any predecessor). (iv) Primarily attributable to investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets— (A) In general. An entity's gross income is primarily attributable to investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets for purposes of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section if the entity's gross income attributable to investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets equals or exceeds 50 percent of the entity's gross income during the shorter of— 15 (1) The three-year period ending on December 31 of the year preceding the year in which the determination is made; or (2) The period during which the entity has been in existence. (B) Special rule for start-up entities An entity with no operating history as of the date of the determination will be considered to have income that is primarily attributable to investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets for the purposes of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section if such entity expects to meet the income threshold described in paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(A) of this section based on its anticipated functions, assets, and employees, with due consideration given to any purpose or functions for which the entity is licensed or regulated (including those of any predecessor). 27. Therefore, an entity (such as a trust) will be an investment entity under the U.S. Treasury Regulations if: 16 • The entity conducts (as a business) specified investment activities for or on behalf of a customer and the entity derives its income primarily (50% or more in the specified period) from these activities (an “in business” investment entity); • The entity is managed by a relevant financial institution that conducts specified investment activities for the entity and the managed entity derives its income primarily (50% or more in the specified period) from investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets (a “deemed” investment entity); or 12 The relevant “manager” in this respect needs to be an entity that is a depository institution, custodial institution, defined type of insurance company, defined type of holding company, defined type of treasury centre, or an “in business” investment entity. For the purposes of this guidance any reference to a “relevant financial institution” in the context of a “manager” under the U.S Treasury Regulations definition of “investment entity” should be read as covering these types of entities. 13 The literal wording of this part of the definition of investment entity is broad in scope. However, it should be read in the context of Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2014-13 (which contains final and temporary regulations relating to FATCA), which provides that, for example, an introducing broker does not manage an entity, in this regard, if it does not have discretionary authority to manage its clients' assets. 14 For the purposes of this guidance this period will be referred to as “the specified period.” 15 For the purposes of this guidance this period will be referred to as “the specified period.” 16 As noted above, this definition is only relevant to determining an entity's FATCA status if the entity chooses to use the definition of investment entity in the U.S. Treasury Regulations in lieu of the corresponding definition in the IGA. 8Trusts guidance notes • The entity functions or holds itself out as a collective investment vehicle, mutual fund, exchange traded fund, private equity fund, hedge fund, venture capital fund, leveraged buyout fund, or any similar investment vehicle established with an investment strategy of investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets. 28. Therefore, the definitions of investment entity in the IGA and the U.S. Treasury Regulations are similar in the sense that they both have “in business” and “deemed” investment entity elements. However, this guidance will now briefly set out some of the key differences between these definitions. Key differences between the IGA and U.S. Treasury Regulations definitions of “investment entity” 29. An entity will be an “investment entity” under the U.S. Treasury Regulations in the following circumstances: a. The entity primarily conducts as a business one or more of the following activities or operations for or on behalf of a customer: • Trading in money market instruments (cheques, bills, certificates of deposit, derivatives, etc); foreign currency; foreign exchange, interest rate, and index instruments; transferable securities; or commodity futures; • Individual or collective portfolio management; or • Investing, administering, or managing funds, money, or financial assets on behalf of other persons. \[This is the “in business” part of the definition of investment entity in the U.S. Treasury Regulations. This part of the definition refers to broadly the same types of specified investment activities as the corresponding part of the definition in the IGA. However, a key difference is the “primarily” requirement in this part of the U.S. Treasury Regulations, which is not in the corresponding part of the definition in the IGA. The U.S. Treasury Regulations also provide that an entity is treated as “primarily conducting as a business” one or more of the specified investment activities (in this respect), if the entity's gross income attributable to such activities equals or exceeds 50% of the entity's total gross income (i.e. if the entity's income is primarily attributable to such activities) during the specified period (see §1.1471- 5(e)(4)(iii) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations). This is different from the IGA investment entity definition, which covers entities where the investment service activity can be minor or an incidental part of the entity's activities as measured by gross income.\] b. The entity is managed by a relevant financial institution \[depository institution, custodial institution, defined type of insurance company, defined type of holding company, defined type of treasury centre, or an “in business” investment entity as set out in §1.1471-5(e)(4)(i)(B) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations\] that conducts specified investment activities for the entity and the entity derives its income primarily from investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets over the specified period. An entity is “managed” by another entity under the Regulations if the managing entity performs, either directly or through another third-party service provider, any of the specified investment activities on behalf of the managed entity. 17 \[This is the “deemed” part of the definition of investment entity in the U.S. Treasury Regulations. This part of the definition differs from the corresponding part of the definition in the IGA in two key respects. Firstly, the “deemed” part of the “investment entity” definition in the U.S Treasury Regulations only applies where the “managed” entity's gross income is primarily attributable to (equal or more than 50% of the entity's total gross income during the specified period – set out in §1.1471-5(e)(4)(iv) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations) investing, reinvesting or trading in financial assets. This is different from the “deemed” part of the “investment entity” definition in the IGA which does not require a consideration of the managed entity's income. Secondly, the class of “manager” (which could be, for example, a trustee or other manager) in this part of the definition in the U.S. Treasury Regulations can be any of a number of types of financial institution as defined in the U.S. Treasury Regulations and is not limited to investment entities only. This guidance sets out a number of examples below, which outline how the “deemed” part of the “investment entity” definitions in the U.S. Treasury Regulations and the IGA will apply in practice.\] c. The entity functions or holds itself out as a collective investment vehicle, mutual fund, exchange traded fund, private equity fund, hedge fund, venture capital fund, leverage buy fund, or similar investment vehicle established with an investment strategy of investing, reinvesting, or trading financial assets. \[The third part of the “investment entity” definition in the U.S. Treasury Regulations covers various types of entities that function or hold themselves out as types of investment vehicles. The IGA definition of “investment entity” does not contain a corresponding part. However, such investment vehicles would be likely to be “in business” or “deemed” investment entities (under the U.S. Treasury Regulations and the IGA). Therefore, this guidance will focus on the “in business” and “deemed” parts of the “investment entity” definitions in the U.S. Treasury Regulations and the IGA.\] 30. This guidance will now, having outlined (1) the key elements of the IGA and U.S. Treasury Regulations definitions of investment entity and (2) the key differences between these definitions, explain (with examples) the circumstances where trusts would be investment entities under these definitions. 17 The literal wording of this part of the definition of investment entity is broad in scope. However, it should be read in the context of Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2014-13 (which contains final and temporary regulations relating to FATCA), which provides that, for example, an introducing broker does not manage an entity, in this regard, if it does not have discretionary authority to manage its clients' assets. 9Trusts guidance notes Trusts as “in business” Investment Entities Application to trusts of the “in business” part of the IGA definition of investment entity 31. A trust will be an “in business” investment entity under the IGA definition if the following elements are satisfied: • The trust is carrying on a business. A “business” is defined in section YA 1 of the ITA 2007 as including “...any profession, trade, or undertaking carried on for profit” 18 . • The trust's business needs to involve carrying on specified investment activities (i.e. the trading in certain instruments, securities and derivatives; individual and collective portfolio management; or investing, administering, or managing funds or money on behalf of other persons); and • The trust's business must be conducted for or on behalf of a customer. 32. The “in business” part of the definition of investment entity in the IGA simply requires that the relevant entity “conducts as a business” any of the specified investment activities for or on behalf of a customer. The definition of investment entity does not contain a qualifying adverb such as “solely” or “primarily” to describe the scope of the investment activity that the entity conducts. This means that an entity can come within the definition of investment entity in the IGA even if the investment activity that the entity carries out is incidental or an adjunct to an entity's core non-investment business. This is different from the corresponding definition in the U.S. Treasury Regulations, which is elaborated on below. 33. A unit trust established under the Unit Trust Act 1960 that carries on specified investment activities as a business for customers will be a common form of “in business” investment entity financial institution under the IGA definition. 19 34. The regulation of unit trusts is subject to transition and regulation under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. A “managed investment scheme” (“MIS”) is defined in section 9 of the FMCA 2013 (subject to various exclusions) as a scheme to which all of the following elements apply: (a) the purpose or effect of the scheme is to enable persons taking part in the scheme to contribute money, or to have money contributed on their behalf, to the scheme as consideration to acquire interests in the scheme; (b) those interests are rights to participate in, or receive, financial benefits produced principally by the efforts of another person under the scheme (whether those rights are actual, prospective, or contingent, and whether they are enforceable or not); and (c) the holders of those interests do not have day-to-day control over the operation of the scheme (whether or not they have the right to be consulted or to give directions). 35. An entity (such as a unit trust) that satisfies the MIS definition and that carries on specified investment activities as a business for customers will be a common form of “in business” investment entity financial institution under the IGA definition. 20 36. A number of other types of trusts (such as family trusts) will generally not carry on a business on behalf of customers. Therefore, if this is the case, they will not be “in business” investment entities under the IGA definition. However, as explained further below, such trusts could still (depending on the circumstances) be “deemed” investment entities. Example 1 – Whether a trust is an “in business” investment entity under the IGA definition? Collective Trust is a New Zealand unit trust established under the Unit Trust Act 1960 that carries on specified collective portfolio management activities for customers as a business. Is Collective Trust an “in business” investment entity under the IGA definition? Ye s . Application to trusts of the “in business” part of the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition of investment entity 21 37. An entity is an “in business” investment entity under the U.S. Treasury Regulations where it “primarily” conducts as a business one or more of the specified investment activities for or on behalf of a customer. An entity is treated as “primarily conducting as a business” such investment activities, in this regard, if the entity's gross income attributable to these activities equals or exceeds 50% of the entity's total gross income during the specified period (i.e. if the entity's gross income is primarily attributable to such specified investment activities during this period). In other words, the gross income derived from providing investment services to customers must be the primary source of the entity's income. 18 Other elements of the “business” definition are not considered to be relevant in the FATCA context. 19 A unit trust that is managed by an investment entity will also be a financial institution under the IGA definition (a deemed investment entity – outlined below) even if it does not carry on a business itself. 20 A MIS that is managed by an investment entity will also be a financial institution under the IGA definition (a deemed investment entity – outlined below) even if it does not carry on a business itself. 21 This is assuming that the trust has decided to use the definition of investment entity in the U.S. Treasury Regulations in lieu of the corresponding definition in the IGA to determine its FATCA status. 10Trusts guidance notes Trusts as “deemed” Investment Entities 38. This guidance will now, having outlined the circumstances where a trust will be an “in business” investment entity under the IGA and the U.S. Treasury Regulations definitions, outline the circumstances where a trust will be a “deemed” investment entity under the IGA and the U.S. Treasury Regulations definitions. Application to trusts of the “deemed” part of the definition of investment entity in the IGA 39. The IGA definition of investment entity deems an entity to be an investment entity where the entity is “managed” by an “in business” investment entity. 40. An entity (such as a trust) will be “managed” by an investment entity (in this way) where the “managing” investment entity is in charge of, administers and regulates, or maintains some control or influence over the “managed” entity's activities 22 . This includes management of the entity's assets (in whole or part). 41. The issue of whether an entity “manages” another entity will always be a question of fact. However, an “in business” investment entity trustee of a trust will generally manage the trust. An “in business” investment entity discretionary fund manager that performs specified investment activities for a trust can also manage the trust. 42. However, where a trust obtains merely ad hoc advice on its portfolio management from an “in business” investment entity and the trustees of that trust: (a) are not investment entities; and (b) are otherwise responsible for the management of the trust/trust's assets (including considering such advice, making investment decisions, and managing the portfolio), this will not constitute “management” by an investment entity under the IGA and the trust will not be a “deemed” investment entity under the IGA definition. Example 2 – Whether a trust is a “deemed” investment entity under the IGA definition? A discretionary family trust is not in business. The trust's assets consist of a share portfolio and the family home. The share portfolio represents 20% of the trust's assets. The trustee is not an investment entity. The trustee out-sources the management of the share portfolio to Fund Manager (which is an “in business” investment entity). Fund Manager has a written mandate to acquire and sell shares subject to the terms of the mandate. Fund Manager regularly buys and sells shares in accordance with this mandate. Is the trust “managed” by Fund Manager, in terms of the IGA definition of a “deemed” investment entity? Ye s . The trust is managed by Fund Manager (an “in business” investment entity), which regularly performs specified investment activities for it and manages the share portfolio. Fund Manager is not required to manage all the trust's assets in order for it to manage the trust. The trust is a “deemed” investment entity, and, therefore, a financial institution, under the IGA definition. Example 3 – Whether a trust is a “deemed” investment entity under the IGA definition? A discretionary trust is not in business. The trust's assets consist of shares and bonds. The trust has two individual trustees. Trustee A (one of the individual trustees) has been empowered to manage and administer all of the assets of the trust. Trustee A manages the trust and does not out-source the management to an “in business” investment entity. Is the trust a “deemed” investment entity under the IGA definition? No. The trust is managed by Trustee A, who is an individual and, therefore, cannot be an “entity” under the IGA. It follows that Trustee A cannot be an “in business” investment entity. Trustee A also does not out-source the management to an “in business” investment entity. Therefore, the family trust is not a “deemed” investment entity under the IGA definition and is not a financial institution. Example 4 – whether a trust is a “deemed” investment entity under the IGA definition? A discretionary family trust is not in business. The trust's assets consist of a share portfolio. The trustee of the trust is a corporate trustee that has been specifically set up to be the trustee of only that trust and to manage the trust. There are no other trustees of the trust. The trust does not outsource the management of the portfolio. The corporate trustee is not in business and is not an investment entity. The corporate trustee has been put in place to protect against unlimited liability that would otherwise arise to a natural person trustee. Is the trust a “deemed” investment entity under the IGA definition? No. The trust is managed by the corporate trustee. The corporate trustee in question is not an investment entity. Therefore, the trust is not a “deemed” investment entity under the IGA definition and is not a financial institution. 22 Refer to definition of “manage” in the Concise Oxford Dictionary 11th Edition. 11Trusts guidance notes Application to trusts of the “deemed” part of the definition of investment entity in the U.S. Treasury Regulations 23 43. A trust will be a “deemed” investment entity under the U.S. Treasury Regulations where: • The trust is “managed” by a relevant financial institution \[depository institution, custodial institution, defined type of insurance company, defined type of holding company, defined type of treasury centre, or an “in business” investment entity as set out in §1.1471-5(e)(4)(i)(B) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations\]. An entity (such as a trust) is “managed” by another entity under the Regulations if the managing entity performs, either directly or through another third-party service provider, any 24 of the specified investment activities (set out in the investment entity definition) on behalf of the managed entity\]; and • The trust's gross income is primarily attributable to investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets over the specified period. The trust's gross income will be primarily attributable to investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets (in this respect) if its gross income attributable to investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets equals or exceeds 50% of its gross income over the specified period. Example 5 – Whether a trust is a deemed investment entity under the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition? A discretionary trust is not in business. The trust's assets consist of shares and bonds. Over the specified period in the preceding three years, all of the trust's income was attributable to investing in financial assets. Global shares make up 20% by value of the trust's total assets. The global share portfolio is managed by Fund Manager (which has discretionary authority to acquire and sell shares subject to the terms of a mandate), which is an “in business” investment entity. Is the trust a “deemed” investment entity under the U.S. Treasury Regulations? Ye s . The trust is managed by Fund Manager (an “in business” investment entity). Fund Manager is not required to manage all the trust's assets in order for it to manage the trust. The trust's income is also primarily attributable to investing in financial assets over the specified period. The trust will be a “deemed” investment entity under the U.S. Treasury Regulations investment entity definition, and therefore will be a financial institution. Example 6 – Whether a trust is a deemed investment entity under the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition? A discretionary family trust is not in business. The trust has a share portfolio (representing 40% of the trust's assets) and two rental properties (representing 60% of the trust's assets). Over the specified period in the preceding three years, 40% of the trust's gross income has been derived from investing in these shares and 60% of the trust's gross income has been derived from these rental properties. The trustee is not an investment entity. However, the trustee out-sources the management of the share portfolio to Fund Manager (which is an “in business” investment entity). Fund Manager has a written mandate to acquire and sell shares subject to the terms of the mandate. Fund Manager regularly buys and sells shares for the trust in accordance with this mandate. Is the trust a “deemed” investment entity under the U.S. Treasury Regulations? No. The trust is managed by Fund Manager (an “in business” investment entity). Fund Manager is not required to manage all the trust's assets in order for it to manage the trust. However, the trust's income is not primarily attributable to investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets 25 (the trust's share portfolio). This is because the proportion of the trust's gross income derived from such activities is less than 50% of its gross income over the specified period. Instead, the trust's income is primarily attributable to its direct interest in rental properties (non-financial assets). Therefore, the trust is not a “deemed” investment entity under the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition and would not be a financial institution. 23 This is assuming that the trust has decided to use the definition of investment entity in the U.S. Treasury Regulations in lieu of the corresponding definition in the IGA in order to determine its FATCA status. 24 The literal wording of this part of the definition of investment entity is broad in scope. However, it should be read in the context of Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2014-13 (which contains final and temporary regulations relating to FATCA), which provides that, for example, an introducing broker does not manage an entity, in this regard, if it does not have discretionary authority to manage its clients' assets. 25 The expression “financial assets” is defined in §1.1471-5(e) (4)(ii) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations and does not include a direct interest in real property. 12Trusts guidance notes 44.

Go to step 6.The trust is a NZFI for the purposes of the IGA. 6. Is the trust a NZFI after applying the relevant definition in the U.S. Treasury Regulations? The trust is a NZFI for the purposes of the IGA. The trust is a NFFE for the purposes of the IGA. \[An NFFE does not have FATCA due diligence and reporting obligations. However, if it is a passive NFFE that holds, for example, a bank account it will need to disclose its Controlling Persons to the bank on request\]. 45. In broad terms, a trust that is a NZFI will be a Reporting NZFI that needs to register with the IRS and undertake FATCA due diligence on its financial accounts (that are not exempted or excluded) unless it is within a category of Non-Reporting NZFI that exempts it from such requirements. The category of Non-Reporting NZFI that is most likely to apply to NZFI trusts (in this way) is the “trustee documented trust” category. Section IV(A) of Annex II of the IGA provides that a trust (such as a family trust) established under the laws of New Zealand that would otherwise be a Reporting NZFI can be a “trustee documented trust” and engage a trustee (that is a Reporting U.S. Financial Institution, Reporting Model 1 FFI, 27 or Participating FFI) to undertake its FATCA reporting on its behalf. In these circumstances, provided that the financial institution trustee reports all information required to be reported with respect to all reportable accounts of the trust, the trust will be treated as a deemed compliant FFI, and, therefore, a Non-Reporting NZFI. A trustee documented trust is not required to register with the IRS. 46. This guidance will now, having set out the circumstances where trusts will be NZFIs, explain what FATCA due diligence and reporting obligations Reporting NZFI trusts will have under the IGA. The focus of this part of the guidance will be on Reporting NZFI trusts that are “investment entities” (the category of financial institution that is most likely to apply to trusts). 26 This excludes any branch located outside New Zealand. 27 This category would include Reporting NZFIs. 13Trusts guidance notes FATCA Due Diligence and Reporting obligations of Reporting NZFI “Investment Entity” Trusts 47. Reporting NZFI investment entity trusts will be required to register with the IRS and undertake FATCA due diligence on their financial accounts (that are not exempted or excluded) to determine whether they have any reportable accounts. 28 Where the Reporting NZFI trust is “solely” 29 an investment entity any equity or debt interests (that are not exempted or excluded) 30 in the trust are financial accounts of the trust. The Reporting NZFI will need to carry out FATCA due diligence on these accounts and (if the accounts are reportable) report on these accounts. Equity or Debt Interests 31 48. Equity or debt interests in such an investment entity trust include for the purposes of the IGA: • Equity interest: - Any person that is treated as a settlor or beneficiary of all or a portion of a trust. A Specified U.S. Person is treated as a beneficiary of a trust if they have the right to receive directly or indirectly (for example, through a nominee) a mandatory distribution (“mandatory beneficiary”) or may receive, directly or indirectly, a discretionary distribution from the trust (“discretionary beneficiary”). In broad terms, a mandatory beneficiary has an entitlement to an amount of property at a set time, whereas a discretionary beneficiary does not have an enforceable right to an amount of property at any set time. \[In determining whether a discretionary beneficiary is the holder of an “equity interest” (and therefore is an account holder of a financial account), a Reporting NZFI investment entity trust is permitted to apply the definition of “equity interest” in §1.1471- 5(b)(3)(iii)(B) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations in lieu of the corresponding definition in the IGA and treat a discretionary beneficiary as being an equity interest account holder for a period only where they have received a distribution directly or indirectly from the trust in that period\]. - Any other natural person exercising ultimate effective control over the trust (this could include, for example, a trustee or protector if they exercise ultimate effective control over the trust). • Debt interest: A debt interest could be held by, for example, a beneficiary (current account) or a third party lender. 49. The following guidance sets out how a Reporting NZFI investment entity trust can calculate the “balance or value” of an equity interest in the trust and how it can determine whether a mandatory or discretionary beneficiary of the trust is a “pre- existing” or “new” account holder of an equity interest. These two points are relevant to FATCA due diligence and reporting (i.e. in the IGA there are “balance or value” dollar threshold exemptions for due diligence and reporting and different due diligence procedures that apply to pre-existing accounts and new accounts.) 32 \[This guidance is based on the assumption that a Reporting NZFI investment entity trust, when determining whether a discretionary beneficiary has an “equity interest” in the trust, will adopt the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition of “equity interest” and treat a discretionary beneficiary as being an equity interest account holder in a period only where the beneficiary has received a distribution directly or indirectly from the trust in that period, so that they are only required to carry out due diligence on those specific discretionary beneficiaries.\] How to calculate the “balance or value” of an equity interest in a Reporting NZFI investment entity trust 50. A Reporting NZFI investment entity trust must, for FATCA due diligence and reporting purposes, determine the “balance or value” of any equity interest (that is not exempted or excluded). 51. The IGA does not define the valuation methodology that a Reporting NZFI needs to adopt to determine the “balance or value” of such equity interests. However, Inland Revenue expects that the Reporting NZFI would adopt the most accurate valuation methodology that is reasonably available in the circumstances. 28 Reporting NZFIs can choose to adopt the due diligence procedures in the U.S. Treasury Regulations in lieu of the procedures in Annex I of the IGA (see Annex I(I)(C) of the IGA). However, this guidance will focus on the application of the procedures under the IGA. 29 The following guidance is based on the assumption that the relevant trust is “solely” an investment entity. This could be compared with, for example, a circumstance where a trust is both an investment entity and a custodial institution. There is a specific rule in Article 1(1)(s)(2) of the IGA which sets out when equity and debt interests in such financial institutions are financial accounts. This is outlined in detail in Inland Revenue's FATCA “reportable accounts” guidance notes. 30 These exemptions/exclusions (including the “regularly traded” exclusion) are outlined in detail in Inland Revenue's FATCA “due diligence” and “reportable accounts” guidance notes. 31 Any reference to “settlor” or “beneficiary” in the following guidance should be read as covering those natural persons that are solely settlors or beneficiaries of the trust (cf, for example, a circumstance where a beneficiary may also exercise ultimate effective control over the trust). 32 This is set out in detail in Inland Revenue's FATCA “due diligence” guidance notes. 14Trusts guidance notes 52. This may be the value calculated by the Reporting NZFI investment entity trust for the purpose that requires the most frequent determination of value. For settlors and beneficiaries, for example, this may be the value that is used for reporting to them, which will generally align with market value. Other methods (including acquisition value, valuations based on a recognised accounting standard, and valuations measured on a recognised actuarial basis) will also be permissible if they reasonably calculate the value of the interest. Balance of value of a settlor's equity interest in a Reporting NZFI investment entity trust 53. The balance or value of a settlor's equity interest will be a question of fact. For example, a settlor may sometimes hold an interest in the whole of the trust (as opposed to being excluded from the trust). In such circumstances, the balance or value of the settlor's equity interest could be determined based on the total value of the assets of the trust and the value that is used for reporting to them. Balance or value of a beneficiary's equity interest in a Reporting NZFI investment entity trust 54. Where a beneficiary is a mandatory beneficiary, the balance or value of their account could be determined as being the amount reported to them as being the total value of all the mandatory distributions that they are entitled to receive (directly or indirectly) from the trust. Where the beneficiary is a discretionary beneficiary, their account balance or value could be determined as being the amount reported to them as being the aggregate value of all discretionary distributions that they have received (directly or indirectly) from the trust in the relevant reporting period. How to determine whether a mandatory or discretionary beneficiary is a “pre-existing” or “new” account holder of an equity interest Pre-existing and new accounts of a mandatory beneficiary 55. A mandatory beneficiary holds an equity interest in a Reporting NZFI investment entity trust. 56. A mandatory beneficiary of such a trust should be treated as a pre-existing account holder for FATCA due diligence purposes if they are a mandatory beneficiary as of 30 June 2014. A mandatory beneficiary that is first appointed or acquires an interest in a Reporting NZFI investment entity trust after 1 July 2014 should be treated as a new account holder for FATCA due diligence purposes. 57. A financial account held by a mandatory beneficiary of such a trust should be treated as closed when the beneficiary has been removed as a mandatory beneficiary or the beneficiary disposes of the equity interest in the trust. Pre-existing and new accounts of a discretionary beneficiary 58. A Reporting NZFI investment entity trust should, if it applies the “equity interest” definition in the U.S. Treasury Regulations in lieu of the corresponding definition in the IGA, treat discretionary beneficiaries as pre-existing or new equity account holders for FATCA due diligence purposes as follows: • Where a discretionary beneficiary receives a trust distribution directly or indirectly from the trust between 1 July 2013 and 30 June 2014, that financial account should be treated as a pre-existing financial account. If the same discretionary beneficiary also receives a trust distribution directly or indirectly in the period from 1 July 2014-31 March 2015 that financial account should be treated as a pre-existing financial account. • Where a discretionary beneficiary receives its first trust distribution directly or indirectly from the trust after 1 July 2014, that financial account should be treated as a new financial account that is opened in the first reporting period that the discretionary beneficiary receives the distribution. Reporting of equity or debt interests 59. If a Reporting NZFI investment entity trust maintains any equity or debt interest financial accounts (that are not exempted or excluded), carries out FATCA due diligence on these accounts, and identifies that they are U.S. Reportable Accounts or held by non-participating financial institutions it will, subject to the following, need to report to Inland Revenue annually about them. 33 33 The trust will need to report (to Inland Revenue) payments that it makes to non-participating financial institutions on an annual basis for 2015 (the period ended 31 March 2016) and 2016 (the period ended 31 March 2017): see Article 4(1)(b) of the IGA. 15Trusts guidance notes A trust can be an account holder 60. This guidance has focused above on how FATCA applies to New Zealand trusts that “maintain” accounts and are financial institutions. However, trusts can also “hold” accounts for FATCA purposes. The definition of “account holder” is set out in Article 1(1)(dd) of the IGA as meaning: “...the person listed or identified as the holder of a Financial Account by the Financial Institution that maintains the account. A person, other than a Financial Institution, holding a Financial Account for the benefit of another person as agent, custodian, nominee, signatory, investment advisor, or intermediary, is not treated as holding the account for the purposes of this Agreement, and such other person is treated as holding the account...” 61. A trust can be an account holder for FATCA purposes even though it is not recognised as a separate legal entity at common law. This is apparent from the following elements of the IGA: (a) An “account holder” is defined in Article 1(1)(dd) of the IGA to mean “the person listed or identified as the holder of a Financial Account... A person, other than a Financial Institution, holding a Financial Account for the benefit of another person as agent, custodian, nominee, signatory, investment advisor, or intermediary, is not treated as holding the account for the purposes of this Agreement, and such other person is treated as holding the account.” A “person” is, in turn, defined in the U.S. Treasury Regulations to mean a person defined in section 7701(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under section 7701(a)(1) the term “person” includes an individual, a trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation. Therefore, a trust is a “person” that can be an account holder. (b) The IGA contemplates that a trust is an “entity” that can be an account holder. There are specific FATCA due diligence procedures in Annex I of the IGA that Reporting NZFIs need to apply to “entity” accounts that they maintain. Article 1(1)(gg) of the IGA also defines “entity” as meaning a “legal person or a legal arrangement such as a trust”. Therefore, the IGA contemplates that trusts can be entity account holders that will be subject to the “entity” account due diligence procedures (see also the comments below regarding accounts held by trusts that are passive NFFEs). (c) The IGA contemplates that a passive NFFE trust is a type of “entity” that can be an account holder. A Reporting NZFI that maintains an account (that is not exempt or excluded) that is held by a passive NFFE trust will need to apply the FATCA due diligence procedures to determine whether the passive NFFE has any U.S. Controlling Persons. The IGA “Controlling Persons” regime attributable to passive NFFEs requires the identification of Controlling Persons which includes (in the context of a trust) a trustee, settlor, protector, beneficiaries or class of beneficiaries, and any other natural person exercising ultimate effective control over the trust 34 . The definition of “Controlling Persons” (which covers various trust roles) clearly contemplates that a trust can be a passive NFFE entity trust account holder. When a trust will be an account holder 62. This then raises the question of when a trust will be an “account holder” for FATCA purposes in terms of Article 1(1)(dd) of the IGA. 63. Where a Reporting NZFI maintains an account that is listed or identified as being held by a trust, the Reporting NZFI should, on the face of it, 35 treat the trust as the account holder and subject the trust to the “entity” FATCA due diligence procedures. For example, where the account holder is listed as: • Mr West as trustee of the West family trust; or • West family trust; or • West family trust account; then the Reporting NZFI can, on the face of it, assume that the account holder is a trust and apply the entity due diligence procedures to that financial account. 64. On the other hand, where the account holder is listed or identified as an individual (not in a trustee capacity), then the Reporting NZFI can assume that the account is held by that individual and not as a trustee of a trust. A constructive trust is an example of a trust where a trust relationship may not be identified in the course of a NZFI determining the status of an account holder as an individual or an entity. 34 The scope of the “Controlling Persons” regime is discussed in detail below from paragraph 80. 35 However, the “listed or identified” element of the definition of “account holder” in Article 1(1)(dd) of the IGA is subject to the fact that “....A person, other than a Financial Institution, holding a Financial Account for the benefit of another person as agent, custodian, nominee, signatory, investment advisor, or intermediary, is not treated as holding the account for the purposes of this Agreement, and such other person is treated as holding the account.” Therefore, the issue of who the account holder is will always be a question of fact. 16Trusts guidance notes 65. A Reporting NZFI may at first identify an account as being held by an individual but subsequently, as part of the due diligence process, come across information that discloses that the individual is in fact a trustee for the financial account. In these circumstances, the Reporting NZFI has “identified” the account holder as a trust and (if the account is not exempted or excluded) should apply the entity due diligence procedures to determine whether the trust is a Specified U.S. Person, passive NFFE with U.S. Controlling Persons, or a non-participating financial institution (reportable accounts). 36 Reporting NZFIs should implement procedures so that they can identify any trust relationship as part of the account opening documentation process. 66. This guidance will now, having set out some of the key principles about when trusts can be Reporting NZFIs (with a focus on the investment entity category of financial institution, which will be particularly relevant in a trusts context) with FATCA due diligence obligations (and how trusts can also be account holders), outline how FATCA will apply to the following types of trusts (that are common in New Zealand): • New Zealand family trusts; • New Zealand trading trusts; and • New Zealand charitable trusts. New Zealand Family Trusts 67. A “family trust” is simply a trust that has a beneficiary class centred on a family group. There are no other defining features in respect of the assets they hold or activities they carry out that separate family trusts from other discretionary trusts. They operate in a spectrum from “simple” trusts that hold one asset (such as a family home) through to trusts that hold numerous complex assets and/or engage in complex financial dealings. As such, there is no “one size fits all” approach to family trusts for FATCA purposes. 68. The guidance sets out below: (1) The circumstances when New Zealand family trusts will be financial institutions for FATCA purposes; and (2) The FATCA obligations that Reporting NZFIs will have when they maintain financial accounts that are held by New Zealand family trusts. Circumstances when New Zealand Family Trusts will be Financial Institutions 69. The potential application of FATCA to New Zealand family trusts has been touched on in some of the discretionary trust examples outlined above. The key points to note are: (a) Most New Zealand family trusts will not be in business and will not have customers. Therefore, they would be unlikely to be custodial institutions, depository institutions, or “in business” investment entities. (b) A New Zealand family trust could (depending on the circumstances) be a “deemed” investment entity, and, therefore, a financial institution, under the relevant 37 definition in the IGA or the U.S. Treasury Regulations: • A family trust will be “managed” in terms of the “deemed” part of the definition of investment entity in the IGA and the U.S. Treasury Regulations where the relevant 38 financial institution “managing” entity (that could be, for instance, a trustee or discretionary fund manager) manages the trust. This includes management of the trust's assets in whole or part (see the above examples). • A family trust that is “managed” by a relevant financial institution would be less likely to be a “deemed” investment entity under the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition (compared with the IGA definition). This is because a number of family trusts (even if managed by a relevant financial institution) may not have gross income that is primarily attributable to investing, reinvesting or trading financial assets (equal or exceeding the 50% threshold) during the specified period. Trusts that do not primarily derive income from financial assets in this way will not be “deemed” investment entities under the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition even if they are managed. 39 Example 6 (see above) illustrates this point. 36 These concepts are explained in detail in Inland Revenue's FATCA “due diligence” guidance notes. 37 This will depend on whether the trust has chosen to use the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition of “investment entity.” 38 The issue of what will be a “relevant” financial institution (in this regard) will depend on whether the “managed” entity has decided to use the definition of investment entity in the U.S. Treasury Regulations in lieu of the corresponding definition in the IGA. As noted above, a relevant “managing” entity under the IGA definition will be an “in business” investment entity, whereas under the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition a relevant managing entity extends to cover certain other types of entities as well. 39 This is based on the assumption that the trust in question chooses to use the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition of “investment entity” in lieu of the corresponding definition in the IGA. 17Trusts guidance notes (c) Where a New Zealand family trust is “solely” an investment entity (for example, because it is an investment entity under the relevant 40 IGA or U.S. Treasury Regulations definition but does not come within any other type of financial institution), any equity or debt interest in the trust (that is not exempted or excluded) will be a financial account. A New Zealand family trust investment entity that is a Reporting NZFI will need to register with the IRS, carry out FATCA due diligence procedures on its financial accounts and report to Inland Revenue on its U.S. Reportable Accounts and accounts held by non- participating financial institutions 41 on an annual basis. (d) However, section IV(A) of Annex II of the IGA provides that a trust (such as a family trust) established under the laws of New Zealand that would otherwise be a Reporting NZFI can be a “trustee documented trust” and engage a trustee (that is a Reporting U.S. Financial Institution, Reporting Model 1 FFI, 42 or Participating FFI) to undertake its FATCA reporting on its behalf. In these circumstances, provided that the trustee reports all information required to be reported with respect to all reportable accounts of the trust, the trust will be treated as a deemed compliant FFI, and, therefore, a Non-Reporting NZFI. A trustee documented trust is not required to register with the IRS. (e) A New Zealand family trust that is not a financial institution is likely to be a NFFE. An NFFE does not have FATCA registration, due diligence, and reporting obligations. However, if it is a passive NFFE 43 (a type of passive vehicle that is not a financial institution) that holds a bank account it will need to disclose its controlling persons to the bank on request. FATCA obligations of Reporting NZFIs that maintain financial accounts held by New Zealand family trusts 70. A Reporting NZFI that maintains an account (that is not exempted or excluded) that is held by a New Zealand family trust will need to carry out FATCA due diligence on the account to determine whether it is reportable (in this context,44 held by a passive NFFE with U.S. Controlling Persons or by a non-participating financial institution). The trust is most likely to be either a financial institution or an NFFE. 45 Therefore, the Reporting NZFI can proceed on this basis. Determining whether a New Zealand family trust account holder is a financial institution 71. A Reporting NZFI will need to carry out the following FACTA due diligence procedures to determine whether the New Zealand family trust account holder is a financial institution: a. For pre-existing accounts (i.e. accounts as of 30 June 2014), a Reporting NZFI will be required to review information maintained for regulatory or customer relationship purposes \[including information collected pursuant to Anti-Money Laundering/Know Your Customer procedures (“AML/KYC” procedures)\] to determine whether the information indicates that the trust account holder is a financial institution. If the information indicates that the trust is a financial institution or the Reporting NZFI verifies the trust's GIIN on the published IRS FFI list then the account will not be a U.S. Reportable Account. 46 b. For new accounts (i.e. accounts opened on or after 1 July 2014) 47 a Reporting NZFI will be able to reasonably determine that the trust account holder is a NZFI on the basis of the trust's GIIN or other information that is publicly available or in their possession. Alternatively, a Reporting NZFI could obtain a self-certification from the trust account holder whether it is a NZFI. If the Reporting NZFI identifies that the account holder is an NZFI the account will not be a U.S. Reportable Account. 48 40 This will depend on whether the trust has chosen to use the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition of “investment entity” in lieu of the corresponding definition in the IGA. 41 The trust will need to carry out FATCA due diligence procedures to identify whether any of its financial accounts are held by non-participating financial institutions and, if so, the trust would need to report such payments to Inland Revenue on an annual basis for 2015 (the period ended 31 March 2016) and 2016 (the period ended 31 March 2017). 42 This category would include Reporting NZFIs. 43 The definitions of “passive NFFE” and “controlling persons” are set out in detail below from paragraph 74 under the heading “Determining whether a family trust account holder is a passive NFFE with U.S. Controlling Persons”. 44 This is assuming that the New Zealand family trust is not itself a Specified U.S. Person. 45 Reporting NZFIs should be aware that there are a number of types of “entity” classification that could be relevant to trusts. For example, a trust could be a Specified U.S. Person, NFFE, U.S. Person that is not a Specified U.S. Person, NZFI or other Partner Jurisdiction financial institution, a participating FFI, a deemed compliant FFI, an exempt beneficial owner, or non-participating financial institution. These different categories of entity classification are explained below (in the context of new entity accounts) under the heading “A framework for Reporting NZFIs applying the new entity account due diligence procedures to Trusts.” However, in practical terms, a New Zealand family trust account holder is most likely to either be a NZFI or an NFFE. Therefore, this guidance will focus on these two categories. If a Reporting NZFI is unable to establish the status of a family trust account holder as being a NZFI or an NFFE it will need to consider the other entity categories. 46 However, if the trust is a non-participating financial institution the Reporting NZFI would still need to report payments that it has made to the trust for 2015 (the period ended 31 March 2016) and 2016 (the period ended 31 March 2017). 47 However, as noted at paragraphs 104-106 of Inland Revenue's FATCA “due diligence” guidance notes, IRS Notice 2014-33 has the effect of allowing Reporting NZFIs to treat new entity financial accounts opened on or after 1 July 2014 and before 1 January 2015 as pre-existing accounts for FATCA due diligence purposes. As set out in the Notice, the ability to treat such accounts as pre-existing accounts does not permit application to such accounts of the U.S. $250,000 balance exception for pre-existing accounts that are not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported. 48 However, if the trust is a non-participating financial institution the Reporting NZFI would still need to report payments that it has made to the trust for 2015 (the period ended 31 March 2016) and 2016 (the period ended 31 March 2017). 18Trusts guidance notes 72. Therefore, the pre-existing and new accounts categories both provide scope for the Reporting NZFI account maintainer to make “reasonable” determinations (based on various defined sources of information – such as account information, the account holder's GIIN, or other information that is publicly available or in their possession) of whether a family trust account holder is a financial institution. The guidance expands on this ability to “reasonably” determine such an account holder's status below (from paragraph 98) in “A framework for Reporting NZFIs applying the new entity account due diligence procedures to Trusts.” 73. For new accounts a Reporting NZFI account maintainer could, alternatively, obtain a self-certification from the family trust account holder to determine whether it is a NZFI. Determining whether a New Zealand family trust account holder is a passive NFFE with U.S. Controlling Persons 74. A Reporting NZFI that determines that a New Zealand family trust account holder is not a financial institution needs to consider whether the trust is a passive NFFE with U.S. Controlling Persons. 75. Section VI(B)(2) of Annex I of the IGA defines “NFFE” as being a: • Non-U.S. entity \[“Non-U.S. entity” is defined in Article 1(1)(hh) of the IGA as being an entity that is not a “U.S. person” 49 \] that is not an FFI as defined in the U.S. Treasury Regulations; • Entity described in section VI(B)(4)(j) of Annex I (i.e. an active NFFE that comes within that section); or • Non-U.S. entity \[“Non-U.S. entity” is defined in Article 1(1)(hh) of the IGA as being an entity that is not a “U.S. person”\] that is established in New Zealand or another Partner Jurisdiction and that is not a financial institution. 76. If the Reporting NZFI identifies that the New Zealand family trust account holder is an NFFE, the next 50 question is whether the NFFE is either an active or passive NFFE. 77. Annex I(VI)(B)(3) of the IGA defines “passive NFFE” as meaning any NFFE that is not (i) an Active NFFE, or (ii) a withholding foreign partnership or withholding foreign trust pursuant to relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations. Annex I(VI)(B)(4) of the IGA, in turn, defines “active NFFE”. The definition of “active NFFE” is set out in full in the Appendix 1 to this guidance. Paragraph (a) of that definition (the paragraph of the definition that is likely to apply to qualify an NFFE for active NFFE status) provides that: “Less than 50 percent of the NFFE's gross income for the preceding calendar year or other appropriate reporting period is passive income and less than 50 percent of the assets held by the NFFE during the preceding calendar year or other appropriate reporting period are assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income.” 78. The Reporting NZFI should, if applicable, adopt the following due diligence procedures for determining whether the New Zealand family trust NFFE account holder is either an active or passive NFFE: • where the account is a pre-existing entity account, obtain a self-certification from the account holder of its status (which may be on IRS form W8 or W9, or similar agreed form), as either a passive or active NFFE, unless the Reporting NZFI has information in its possession or which is publicly available, based on which it can reasonably determine that the account holder is an active NFFE. 51 • where the account is a new entity account, obtain a self-certification of the account holder's status as either a passive or active NFFE, unless the Reporting NZFI reasonably determines that the account holder is an active NFFE based on information that is publicly available or in the possession of the Reporting NZFI. 52 79. If the Reporting NZFI determines that the New Zealand family trust account holder is a passive NFFE they will need to identify the “Controlling Persons” of the passive NFFE and determine whether any of the Controlling Persons are U.S. citizens or tax residents (“U.S. Controlling Persons”). Controlling Persons 80. “Controlling Persons” are defined in the IGA to mean (in the context of trusts): • settlor; • trustees; • protector (if any); • beneficiaries or class of beneficiaries; and • any other natural person exercising ultimate effective control over the trust. The term Controlling Persons shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations (“FATFR”). 49 Article 1(1)(ee) of the IGA defines “U.S. Person” as meaning: “.....a U.S. citizen or resident individual, a partnership or corporation organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, a trust if (i) a court within the United States would have authority under applicable law to render orders or judgments concerning substantially all issues regarding administration of the trust; and (ii) one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or an estate of a decedent that is a citizen or resident of the United States. This subparagraph 1(ee) shall be interpreted in accordance with the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.....” 50 However, as explained below, it may be appropriate in certain circumstances for the Reporting NZFI that maintains the account to change the order of the enquiry. 51 See Annex I section IV(D)(4)(b) of the IGA. 52 See Annex I section V(B)(1) and (3) of the IGA. 19Trusts guidance notes Beneficiaries as Controlling Persons 81. The reference in the definition of “Controlling Persons” to “beneficiaries or class of beneficiaries” is potentially broad in scope. However, as noted above, the definition needs to be interpreted in a manner consistent with the FATFR. 82. If a beneficiary of a passive NFFE trust account holder has a right to receive a mandatory distribution either directly or indirectly from the trust the Reporting NZFI account maintainer will need to identify the beneficiary as a controlling person of the trust. 53 83. However, FATFR provides that for beneficiary(ies) of trusts that are designated by characteristics or by class, institutions (such as Reporting NZFIs that maintain accounts held by such trusts) only need to obtain sufficient information concerning the beneficiary to satisfy the institution that it will be able to finally establish the identity of the beneficiary at the time of pay-out or when the beneficiary intends to exercise vested rights. 54 84. By extension of this point, a Reporting NZFI can decide to identify discretionary beneficiaries of a passive NFFE trust account holder as controlling persons of the trust if and when the beneficiaries receive a distribution either directly or indirectly in the period. However, a Reporting NZFI would (if they decide to only identify discretionary beneficiaries as controlling persons in such circumstances) need to develop procedures to identify whether, for example, such distributions have been made by the trust. 55 Reporting NZFIs can rely on AML/KYC Procedures to determine Controlling Persons 85. The IGA also provides that information collected and maintained under AML/KYC procedures can be used to determine “Controlling Persons” as defined in the IGA. For example: • where the account is a pre-existing entity account the Reporting NZFI may rely on information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC procedures to determine the Controlling Persons; 56 and • where the account is a new entity account the Reporting NZFI must identify the Controlling Persons as determined under AML/KYC procedures. 57 Determining whether any Controlling Persons are “U.S.” Controlling Persons 86. Once a Reporting NZFI has identified the “Controlling Persons” they will then need to determine whether any of those persons are “U.S.” Controlling Persons. The Reporting NZFI would need to apply the following process to determine this matter: • where the account is a pre-existing entity account the Reporting NZFI may rely on: 58 - Information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC procedures when the account has a balance or value that does not exceed U.S. $1,000,000; or - A self-certification (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or W-9, or a similar agreed form) from the account holder or such Controlling Person if the account has a balance or value that exceeds U.S. $1,000,000. • where the account is a new entity account the Reporting NZFI may rely on a self-certification from the account holder or such Controlling Person. 59 87. If the Reporting NZFI that maintains an account identifies that the trust account holder is a passive NFFE with any U.S. Controlling Person(s) the account will (unless exempted or excluded) be a U.S. Reportable Account. 88. It may be appropriate in certain circumstances for the Reporting NZFI that maintains the account to change the order of the enquiry. That is, having identified the trust account holder as being an NFFE, a Reporting NZFI may then decide to determine or obtain a self-certification (in accordance with the procedures in the IGA) for pre-existing entity accounts, or require self- certification for new entity accounts regarding whether a Controlling Person of the NFFE is a U.S. citizen or resident. The further question, 60 as to whether or not the entity is an active or passive NFFE, would only be applied to those NFFEs which have any U.S. Controlling Person(s). Those accounts that are held by passive NFFEs with U.S. Controlling Persons will (unless exempted or excluded) need to be reported as U.S. Reportable Accounts. 53 However, as explained below, a Reporting NZFI can rely on information collected pursuant to AML/KYC procedures to identify controlling persons. 54 However, as explained below, a Reporting NZFI can rely on information collected pursuant to AML/KYC procedures to identify controlling persons. 55 However, as explained below, a Reporting NZFI can rely on information collected pursuant to AML/KYC procedures to identify controlling persons. 56 See Annex I section IV(D)(4)(a) of the IGA. 57 See Annex I section V(B)(3)(b) of the IGA. 58 See Annex I section IV(D)(4)(C) of the IGA. 59 See Annex I section V(B)(3)(b) of the IGA. 60 For those NFFEs where this “further question” is not posed, the Reporting NZFI would still have determined that the account holder is not a passive NFFE with U.S. Controlling Persons (on the basis of establishing that it is an NFFE that does not have any US Controlling Persons), and, therefore, will have determined that the account is not a U.S. Reportable account. Therefore, this approach is consistent with the scheme of the IGA, which, for NFFE accounts, only requires FATCA reporting (as U.S. Reportable accounts) of accounts held by passive NFFEs with U.S. Controlling Persons. 20Trusts guidance notes New Zealand Trading Trusts 89. A New Zealand trust could also be a trading trust. It is likely that New Zealand trading trusts will be either financial institutions or NFFEs, with the NFFE classification being the most likely. Circumstances when New Zealand Trading Trusts will be Financial Institutions 90. A New Zealand trading trust that is in business should consider whether the activities that it undertakes mean that it is a custodial institution, a depository institution, an “in business” investment entity (in terms of the relevant 61 definition of “investment entity”), or a specified insurance company, and, therefore, a financial institution. 91. A New Zealand trading trust should also consider whether it is a “deemed” investment entity, and therefore, a financial institution on the basis that: • It has chosen to apply the IGA definition of “investment entity” and the trust is managed by an “in business” investment entity; or • It has chosen to apply the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition of “investment entity” and the following circumstances are satisfied: The trading trust is managed by a relevant financial institution that conducts specified investment activities for the trust and the trust's gross income is primarily attributable (equal or exceeding 50% of the trust's gross income in the specified period) to investing, reinvesting or trading in financial assets. 92. A New Zealand trading trust that is a Reporting NZFI will have FATCA registration, due diligence, and reporting obligations. 93. However, section IV(A) of Annex II of the IGA provides that a trust (such as a New Zealand trading trust) established under the laws of New Zealand that would otherwise be a Reporting NZFI can be a “trustee documented trust” and engage a trustee (that is a Reporting U.S. Financial Institution, Reporting Model 1 FFI, 62 or Participating FFI) to undertake its FATCA reporting on its behalf. In these circumstances, provided that the trustee reports all information required to be reported with respect to all reportable accounts of the trust, the trust will be treated as a deemed compliant FFI, and, therefore, a Non-Reporting NZFI. A trustee documented trust is not required to register with the IRS. 94. A New Zealand trading trust that is not a financial institution is likely to be an NFFE. FATCA obligations of Reporting NZFIs that maintain financial accounts held by New Zealand trading trusts 95. As noted above, a trust can also be an account holder in a Reporting NZFI. This point applies equally to New Zealand trading trusts. This means that Reporting NZFIs (such as, for example, banks) that maintain accounts held by trading trusts will (unless the account is excluded or exempted) need to carry out FATCA due diligence (as outlined above regarding family trusts) on the account to determine if the account is reportable. New Zealand Charitable Trusts 96. The Memorandum of Understanding that New Zealand has entered into with the U.S., with respect to the IGA, provides that: It is understood that organizations registered under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 and the Charities Act 2005, and donee organizations as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007, would be treated as NFFEs that satisfy subparagraph B(4)(j) of section VI of Annex I (Emphasis added). 97. Therefore, there is an understanding that such charitable trusts would be treated as active NFFEs coming within section VI(B) (4) (j) of Annex I of the IGA. A Reporting NZFI that maintains accounts held by an active NFFE will not be required to report the accounts. 61 This will depend on whether the trading trust has decided to apply the U.S Treasury Regulations definition of investment entity. 62 This category would include Reporting NZFIs. 21Trusts guidance notes A framework for Reporting NZFIs applying the new entity account due diligence procedures to Trusts 63 98. The following guidance sets out an acceptable framework that Reporting NZFIs can apply when carrying out FATCA due diligence on new entity accounts (i.e. accounts opened on or after 1 July 2014) held by trusts. Reporting NZFIs are not required to follow this framework and other approaches to due diligence may be acceptable. 99. Section V(B) of Annex I of the IGA sets out the due diligence procedures for identifying the status for FATCA purposes for new entity accounts, such as trust accounts. A Reporting NZFI is required to determine whether a trust account holder is a: • Specified U.S. Person • New Zealand Financial Institution • Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution • A Participating FFI • A deemed compliant FFI • Exempt beneficial owner • Active NFFE • Passive NFFE • Non-participating financial institution 100. Reporting NZFIs will need to report accounts that they maintain that are U.S. Reportable Accounts (held by Specified U.S. Persons, passive NFFEs that have U.S. Controlling Persons) or held by non-participating financial institutions. 64 101. Generally speaking section V(B)(1) of Annex I of the IGA permits a Reporting NZFI to “reasonably determine” whether a new account holder is a NZFI, other Partner Jurisdiction FI, or active NFFE in certain defined circumstances. In all other cases, a Reporting NZFI must obtain self-certification from the account holder of its FATCA status. This process is explained in detail below. A Reporting NZFI may “reasonably determine” a trust's FATCA status 102. A Reporting NZFI may “reasonably determine” that a trust account holder is a NZFI, other Partner Jurisdiction FI, or an active NFFE, if the Reporting NZFI can reasonably determine such status on the basis of the trust's GIIN, publicly available information, or information in their possession. 103. More specifically, a Reporting NZFI may reasonably determine that a trust account holder is a NZFI, other Partner Jurisdiction FI, or active NFFE on the basis of the following: (a) Identifying that the trust is a New Zealand resident entity or Partner Jurisdiction entity that has a GIIN and is a financial institution. (b) The Reporting NZFI may be aware, on the basis of publicly available information or information in their possession, that the account holder is a New Zealand unit trust established under the Unit Trust Act 1960 or a registered MIS under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 that carries on specified investment activities as a business for customers (or is managed by an investment entity that carries on such activities for it). This information would be sufficient for the Reporting NZFI to reasonably determine that the unit trust or collective investment vehicle comes within the definition of investment entity in the IGA and is a NZFI. 65 (c) Where the trust is registered under the Charitable Trust Act 1957, registered on the Charities Register established under the Charities Act 2005, or is a donee organisation pursuant to the ITA 2007. The Charities Register and list of donee organisations 66 are publicly available information which a Reporting NZFI can rely on, to reasonably determine that the entity is an active NFFE. 63 This framework assumes that the account is not exempt or excluded. 64 The Reporting NZFI will need to report (to Inland Revenue) payments that it makes to non-participating financial institutions on an annual basis for 2015 (the period ended 31 March 2016) and 2016 (the period ended 31 March 2017): see Article 4(1)(b) of the IGA. 65 This is assuming that the trust has not decided to use the definition of investment entity in the U.S. Treasury Regulations in lieu of the corresponding definition in the IGA and informed the Reporting NZFI of this fact. 66 List available on Inland Revenue's website. 22Trusts guidance notes (d) The Reporting NZFI reasonably determines that a New Zealand resident trust account holder is a deemed investment entity that is a NZFI based on the trust having a GIIN (outlined above), or based on other publicly available information or information in their possession. For example, the Reporting NZFI could make such a reasonable determination if: • They reasonably determine that the trust is managed by an “in business” investment entity such that the trust can be treated as a deemed investment entity. 67 \[This “management” could be “reasonably determined” on the basis that, for example, a trustee or discretionary fund manager of the trust has a GIIN. It will be reasonable for the Reporting NZFI to presume in such circumstances (unless they know otherwise) that the trustee or fund manager is an “in business” investment entity (being the type of financial institution mostly likely to apply to trustees/fund managers that are financial institutions with GIINs) that manages the trust\]; or • The trust has decided to apply the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition of investment entity and has informed the Reporting NZFI of this fact and the Reporting NZFI reasonably determines that the trust is a “deemed” investment entity under the U.S. Treasury Regulations definition (i.e. that the trust is managed by a relevant type of financial institution 68 and the trust's gross income is primarily attributable to investing, reinvesting or trading financial assets over the specified period). If a Reporting NZFI reasonably determines that an account is held by a NZFI, Partner Jurisdiction FI, or active NFFE, the account will not be a U.S. Reportable Account. However, the account will still be reportable if it is held by a non- participating financial institution. 69 Steps to follow where a Reporting NZFI has not otherwise “reasonably determined” the trust's status 104. Where a Reporting NZFI has not otherwise “reasonably determined” the trust's status (as being an active NFFE, NZFI, or Partner Jurisdiction FI) it needs to obtain a self- certification from the trust to determine its status. This could occur when the Reporting NZFI has not been able to reasonably determine the trust's status or has gone straight to seeking a self-certification of the trust's status. The Reporting NZFI may proceed on the basis that the most likely categories that could apply to the trust (if not a financial institution) are either the Specified U.S. Person or NFFE categories. 70 The self-certification ordering in section V(B)(3) of Annex I of the IGA reflects this logic. Self-certification whether the trust is a Specified U.S. Person 105. The relevant definitions for determining whether a trust is a Specified U.S. Person are set out in the IGA. It is necessary to consider both the definitions of “U.S. Person” and “Specified U.S. Person” in Article 1(1)(ee) 71 and (ff) of the IGA. These two definitions contain further definitions of when a trust is a U.S. Person and specific exclusions from this definition for the purpose of determining a Specified U.S. Person (for example, a real estate investment trust as defined in section 856 of the U.S. Internal Revenue code, is not a Specified U.S. Person). The definition of “Specified U.S Person” is set out in full at Appendix 2 to this guidance. 106. Reporting NZFIs can apply the following process for self-certification of trust account holders as Specified U.S. Persons. As part of the account opening documentation which is required to be “signed off ” by, for example, the trustees (on behalf of the trust) they could be asked the following questions which relate to determining whether a trust is a U.S. Person: • Are there any U.S. persons, which have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust? \[If the answer to this question is yes, then proceed to the next question\]. • Would a U.S. Court have authority to render orders or judgments concerning substantially all issues regarding administration of the trust? 107. These questions are cumulative, so only where the answer is “yes” to both questions, will the trust be a U.S. Person. The Reporting NZFI can then treat the trust as being a Specified U.S. Person (unless the trust certifies that it is a U.S. Person that is not a Specified U.S. Person). 108. If the Reporting NZFI identifies that the account is held by a Specified U.S. Person the account will be a U.S. Reportable Account. 67 However, this point is subject to the second bullet point below. 68 This could be presumed based on, for example, determining that the “manager” has a GIIN. 69 The Reporting NZFI will need to report (to Inland Revenue) payments that it makes to non-participating financial institutions on an annual basis for 2015 (the FATCA period ended 31 March 2016) and 2016 (the FATCA period ended 31 March 2017): see Article 4(1)(b) of the IGA. 70 However, if the Reporting NZFI is unable to determine that the account holder comes within one of these categories it will need to consider the other categories (outlined above). 71 Article 1(1)(ee) of the IGA defines “U.S. Person” as meaning “.....a U.S. citizen or resident individual, a partnership or corporation organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, a trust if (i) a court within the United States would have authority under applicable law to render orders or judgments concerning substantially all issues regarding administration of the trust; and (ii) one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or an estate of a decedent that is a citizen or resident of the United States. This subparagraph 1(ee) shall be interpreted in accordance with the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.....” 23Trusts guidance notes Self-certification whether a Trust is a passive NFFE with U.S. Controlling Persons 109. If the Reporting NZFI has not been able to reasonably determine that the trust account holder is a NZFI or Partner Jurisdiction FI or active NFFE and has not identified that the trust is a U.S. Person, they will need to obtain a self-certification from the trust as to whether or not it is a passive NFFE with U.S. Controlling Persons. 72 If the account is held by a passive NFFE with U.S. Controlling Persons, it will be a U.S. Reportable Account. Conversely, if an account is held by an NFFE with no U.S. Controlling Persons it will not be a U.S. Reportable Account. 110. If the trust self-certifies that it is an NFFE, 73 the “next” question which needs to be answered is whether the trust NFFE is a passive or active NFFE. As a key focus of FATCA is passive NFFEs which have Controlling Persons which are either U.S. citizens or U.S. tax resident (these are the only NFFE accounts that are U.S. Reportable Accounts), 74 a Reporting NZFI may wish to first obtain a self- certification from the NFFE account holder or Controlling Persons as to whether any Controlling Person is a U.S. citizen or U.S. tax resident. The Reporting NZFI can then focus on those NFFEs which have U.S. Controlling Persons, to specifically determine which of them are either active or passive NFFEs. A Reporting NZFI may, for these purposes, wish to focus principally on paragraph (a) of the definition of “active NFFE” in section VI(B)(4) of Annex I of the IGA, which deals with the 50% rule for passive income and assets, which is the definition most likely to apply to qualify an NFFE for active NFFE status. For example, the Reporting NZFI may ask questions such as: • Was the gross passive income 75 that the NFFE derived during the preceding reporting period less than 50% of the NFFE's total gross income? and • Were less than 50% of the assets held by the NFFE during the preceding reporting period, assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income? 111. Where a NFFE trust answers “yes” to both these questions (for example, the trust may confirm that it derives predominantly active income and has assets that predominantly produce or are held for the production of active income), the Reporting NZFI can determine that the trust is an active NFFE. The account will, therefore, not be a U.S. Reportable Account. 72 This is assuming that the trust does not certify that is has another FATCA status (for example, being an exempt beneficial owner). 73 The definition of NFFE in the IGA covers certain New Zealand trusts and trusts from other jurisdictions (excluding U.S. persons) that are not financial institutions. The same self-certification process can be applied to all NFFE account holders. 74 The purpose here is to determine whether or not the trust account holder is a passive NFFE with U.S. Controlling Persons. As noted above, the IGA provides that a trust account that has been identified as being held by an NFFE without any U.S. Controlling persons is not a U.S. Reportable Account. Therefore, to the extent that a Reporting NZFI has obtained a self-certification from the trust that it is a NFFE and has obtained a self-certification (from the trust or the Controlling Persons) that the trust does not have any U.S. Controlling Persons, such a certification would be sufficient to determine that the trust is therefore not a passive NFFE with any U.S. Controlling Persons. Therefore, the account would not be a U.S. Reportable Account. This would be a sufficient self-certification in this context. 75 Passive income would cover various types of income that are derived “passively”, as opposed to, for instance, through “active” trading operations. This would generally be considered to include (but would not be limited to) dividends, interest (and substitute amounts), rents and royalties (other than rents and royalties derived in the active conduct of a trade/business), annuities, and amounts received under cash value insurance contracts. 24Trusts guidance notes Appendix 1: Definition of “active NFFE” in section VI(B)(4) of Annex I of the IGA: An “Active NFFE” means any NFFE that meets any of the following criteria: a) Less than 50 percent of the NFFE's gross income for the preceding calendar year or other appropriate reporting period is passive income and less than 50 percent of the assets held by the NFFE during the preceding calendar year or other appropriate reporting period are assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income; b) The stock of the NFFE is regularly traded on an established securities market or the NFFE is a Related Entity of an Entity the stock of which is regularly traded on an established securities market; c) The NFFE is organized in a U.S. Territory and all of the owners of the payee are bona fide residents of that U.S. Territory; d) The NFFE is a government (other than the U.S. Government), a political subdivision of such government (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes a state, province, county, region or municipality), or a public body performing a function of such government or a political subdivision thereof, a government of a U.S. Territory, an international organization, a non-U.S. central bank of issue, or an Entity wholly owned by one or more of the foregoing; e) Substantially all of the activities of the NFFE consist of holding (in whole or in part) the outstanding stock of, or providing financing and services to, one or more subsidiaries that engage in trades or businesses other than the business of a Financial Institution, except that an NFFE shall not qualify for this status if the NFFE functions (or holds itself out) as an investment fund, such as a private equity fund, venture capital fund, leveraged buyout fund, or any investment vehicle whose purpose is to acquire or fund companies and then hold interests in those companies as capital assets for investment purposes; f) The NFFE is not yet operating a business and has no prior operating history, but is investing capital into assets with the intent to operate a business other than that of a Financial Institution, provided that the NFFE shall not qualify for this exception after the date that is 24 months after the date of the initial organization of the NFFE; g) The NFFE was not a Financial Institution in the past five years, and is in the process of liquidating its assets or is reorganizing with the intent to continue or recommence operations in a business other than that of a Financial Institution; h) The NFFE primarily engages in financing and hedging transactions with or for Related Entities that are not Financial Institutions, and does not provide financing or hedging services to any Entity that is not a Related Entity, provided that the group of any such Related Entities is primarily engaged in a business other than that of a Financial Institution; i) The NFFE is an “excepted NFFE” as described in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations; or j) The NFFE meets all of the following requirements: i. It is established and operated in its jurisdiction of residence exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, artistic, cultural, athletic, or educational purposes; or it is established and operated in its jurisdiction of residence and it is a professional organization, business league, chamber of commerce, labor organization, agricultural or horticultural organization, civic league or an organization operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare; ii. It is exempt from income tax in its jurisdiction of residence; iii. It has no shareholders or members who have a proprietary or beneficial interest in its income or assets; iv. The applicable laws of the NFFE's jurisdiction of residence or the NFFE's formation documents do not permit any income or assets of the NFFE to be distributed to, or applied for the benefit of, a private person or non- charitable Entity other than pursuant to the conduct of the NFFE's charitable activities, or as payment of reasonable compensation for services rendered, or as payment representing the fair market value of property which the NFFE has purchased; and v. The applicable laws of the NFFE's jurisdiction of residence or the NFFE's formation documents require that, upon the NFFE's liquidation or dissolution, all of its assets be distributed to a governmental entity or other non-profit organization, or escheat to the government of the NFFE's jurisdiction of residence or any political subdivision thereof. 25Trusts guidance notes Appendix 2: Definition of “Specified U.S. Person” in Article 1(1)(ff) of the IGA: The term “Specified U.S. Person” means a U.S. Person, other than: (i) a corporation the stock of which is regularly traded on one or more established securities markets; (ii) any corporation that is a member of the same expanded affiliated group, as defined in section 1471(e)(2) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as a corporation described in clause (i); (iii) the United States or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality thereof; (iv) any State of the United States, any U.S. Territory, any political subdivision of any of the foregoing, or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing; (v) any organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or an individual retirement plan as defined in section 7701(a)(37) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; (vi) any bank as defined in section 581 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; (vii) any real estate investment trust as defined in section 856 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; (viii) any regulated investment company as defined in section 851 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or any entity registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-64); (ix) any common trust fund as defined in section 584(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; (x) any trust that is exempt from tax under section 664(c) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or that is described in section 4947(a) (1) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; (xi) a dealer in securities, commodities, or derivative financial instruments (including notional principal contracts, futures, forwards, and options) that is registered as such under the laws of the United States or any State; (xii) a broker as defined in section 6045(c) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; or (xiii) any tax-exempt trust under a plan that is described in section 403(b) or section 457(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.

Business Ngā Ūmanga IR1090 | May 2018 What is the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act? Persons and tax residents of the United States of America (US) are required to report their worldwide income to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), whether they live in the US or not. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is US legislation that aims to reduce tax evasion by US citizens, tax residents, and certain entities controlled by such US persons. FATCA has applied since 1 July 2014 and was incorporated into New Zealand law 1 . It requires New Zealand financial institutions to: • identify accounts held (and in certain circumstances controlled) by US persons; • collect prescribed information about such persons and accounts, including: – the person's US taxpayer identification number (TIN) – account balance – account income, and – certain payments • report this information to us, for exchanging with the US. What do I need to do? In order to hold a financial account in New Zealand, you are required by law to comply with all FATCA and other automatic exchange of information (AEOI) obligations such as requests by your financial institution about whether you are a US person. Note: If you do not comply with all of your AEOI obligations then the financial institution may not open an account for you, or may freeze and/or close your account. If your financial institution has identified that you may be a US person (based on indicators such as a US mailing address or self-certification) they will ask you for certain identity information. This includes your US taxpayer identification number (TIN) - the US equivalent of an IRD number. Possible examples of US TINs, include the: • Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN), • Social Security Number (SSN), and • Employer Identification Number (EIN). If you receive a request for your US TIN you must promptly: • provide your US TIN to the financial institution, or • confirm with the financial institution that you are not a US person - this is known as a self-certification, which may need to be accompanied by supporting documentation. Note: If you intend to open a new account and do not provide the relevant information, the financial institution must not open the account. Account freezing and closure If the financial institution does open your account then it is legally required to also check whether the account information you provided is correct. As part of this process you may be asked to provide additional information and documentation. 2 Note: If you do not respond correctly and completely to their requests for information then the financial institution might freeze and/or close your account. Penalties If you do not respond to requests for such information (or provide incorrect information), you may be subject to a New Zealand: • civil penalty of $1,000, and/or • criminal penalty if you knowingly do not respond to such requests. Please refer to Section 9.2 of our Guidance on the Common Reporting Standard for Automatic Exchange of Information (IR1048) guide, for more detail about the nature of your New Zealand obligations, and penalties that could apply if you do not respond to requests for such information.

Mga Indibidwal Ngā Hunga Takitahi PAPEL-KAALAMAN Paninirahan sa New Zealand para sa buwis – mga bagong migrante Ang impormasyong ito ay nagpapaliwanag sa mga tuntunin tungkol sa paninirahan sa New Zealand para sa buwis na may kaugnayan sa mga bagong migrante. Ipinapaliwanag din nito kung ano ang kailangan mong ibigay sa Inland Revenue kapag humihiling ng kumpirmasyon ng katayuan ng iyong paninirahan para sa buwis para sa iyong aplikasyon sa permanent resident visa sa Immigration New Zealand. Kung ikaw ay isang residente ng New Zealand para sa buwis 1. Karaniwan, kung ikaw ay residente ng New Zealand para sa buwis, dapat kang magbayad ng buwis sa New Zealand sa iyong kinikita sa buong mundo. 2. Ang paninirahan para sa buwis ay kaugnay din kung maaari kang makatanggap ng Working for Families tax credits (mga credit sa buwis ng Nagtatrabaho para sa mga Pamilya), kabilang ang Best Start (kabayaran para sa mga pamilyang may bagong silang na anak). May iba pang mga kahingian na dapat ding matugunan, kabilang dito na hindi pansamantalang entry class visa ang hawak mo sa New Zealand. 3. Ang mga bagong migrante ay maaaring makakuha ng pansamantalang exemption sa pagbabayad ng buwis sa karamihan ng mga uri ng kita mula sa ibang bansa. Ang pansamantalang exemption na ito ay tatagal ng humigit-kumulang 4 na taon. 4. Kung gagamitin mo ang pansamantalang exemption sa pagbabayad ng buwis, ikaw at ang iyong asawa/partner ay hindi maaaring tumanggap ng Working for Families tax credits (kabilang ang Best Start). Kung alinman sa inyo ay mag-aaplay para sa Working for Families tax credits, mawawala sa inyo ang pansamantalang exemption sa pagbabayad ng buwis. Hindi ka na makakapagbago ng isip kapag nagawa mo na ito. Kapag ikaw ay naging residente ng New Zealand para sa buwis 5. Ikaw ay magiging residente ng New Zealand para sa buwis kung ikaw ay: ynakapanatili na sa New Zealand nang mahigit sa 183 araw sa loob ng isang 12-buwan, o ymayroong permanenteng tirahan sa New Zealand. Ang 183-araw na tuntunin 6. Karamihan sa mga bagong migrante sa New Zealand ay magiging residente ng New Zealand para sa buwis sa ilalim ng 183-araw na tuntunin. Ito ay dahil kapag ikaw ay nakapanatili na sa New Zealand nang mahigit sa 183 araw sa loob ng 12 buwan, magsisimula sa unang araw ang iyong paninirahan para sa buwis. 7. Maaaring magsimula nang mas maaga ang iyong paninirahan para sa buwis, kung mayroon kang permanenteng tirahan sa New Zealand bago ang unang araw na binibilang para sa 183-araw na tuntunin (tingnan mula sa \[9\]). 8. Dahil ang iyong paninirahan para sa buwis ay magsisimula sa unang araw ng 183 araw, maaari kang maging residente ng New Zealand para sa buwis mula sa isang petsa bago ka lumipat dito. Halimbawa, maaari itong mangyari kung dumating ka sa New Zealand para mag- holiday o interbyuhin para sa trabaho bago ka lumipat dito. Pagkakaroon ng permanenteng tirahan sa New Zealand 9. Ang isa pang paraan na maaari kang maging residente ng New Zealand para sa buwis ay sa pamamagitan ng pagkakaroon ng permanenteng tirahan dito. 10. Magkakaroon ka ng permanenteng tirahan sa New Zealand kung ikaw ay mayroong bahay o apartment o iba pang tirahan (isang tirahan) sa New Zealand kung saan ka palagi o karaniwang nakatira. Hindi kailangang manirahan ka roon sa lahat ng oras. 11. Hindi mahalaga kung mayroon ka ring permanenteng tirahan sa ibang bansa. Basta't mayroon kang permanenteng tirahan sa New Zealand, ikaw ay magiging residente para sa buwis dito. Hindi mahalaga kung saan ka gugugol ng mas maraming oras o alin ang iyong itinuturing na pangunahin mong bahay. 12. Hindi mo kailangang magmay-ari ng propyedad para maging permanente mong tirahan ito. Maaaring ito ay propyedad na iyong inuupahan, hawak sa kumpanya o trust, o na ang may-ari nito ay isang kapamilya. Maaaring maging permanente mong tirahan ang isang inuupahang bahay o apartment kahit na mayroon kang yugtuang pangungupahan (periodic tenancy) (hindi isang may- takdang pangungupahan (fixed-term tenancy)).

Business Ngā Ūmanga IR1095 | July 2024 Read this factsheet to work out whether you’re a withholder, if you need to deduct RLWT from a residential land sale and your obligations. Deducting residential land withholding tax (RLWT) RLWT may need to be deducted from residential land sales. Sale means any form of disposal of the property including transfers or gifts. The person that withholds the deduction is called a withholder. RLWT generally needs to be deducted when: • the property being sold meets the definition of residential land, is located in New Zealand, and • the vendor is an offshore RLWT person (this differs from the definition of offshore persons for IRD number applications), and • the bright-line test applies because the property is being sold within 2 years of buying it. Note: For property sold before 1 July 2024, different timeframes apply. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/ bright-line Work out if you're a withholder You're a withholder if: • you're the conveyancer for the vendor (unless the vendor is associated to the purchaser) • the vendor does not have a conveyancer and you're the conveyancer for the purchaser • you're the purchaser of the property and neither you nor the vendor have a conveyancer, or • you're the purchaser of the property and you and the vendor are associated persons. To decide if you're associated persons, use A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes - IR620 at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Deducting RLWT To confirm if RLWT needs to be deducted, get a completed Residential land withholding tax declaration - IR1101 from all offshore RLWT persons selling residential land in New Zealand within: • 2 years of buying it when the property is sold on or after 1 July 2024. • 5 years of buying it when the property is sold before 1 July 2024. An IR1101 must be completed even if an exclusion applies and no RLWT will be deducted. If the vendor does not give you an IR1101, or the IR1101 is incomplete, you may assume that they're an offshore RLWT person if they meet the other withholding requirements and deduct RLWT from the purchase amount. This may avoid the risk of penalties being imposed on you. Do not deduct RLWT if the vendor: • shows you a valid certificate of exemption from RLWT for the property being sold, or • provides the required documents to show it's an excluded property sale. You need to make a copy of these documents for your records. Note: There are exclusions for main homes, inherited property, and land transferred under a relationship property agreement. Find out more about your obligations when deducting RLWT at ird.govt.nz/rlwt How much to deduct Using our RLWT calculator is the easiest and fastest way to work out how much RLWT to deduct. Find the calculator at ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators If you're manually working out how much RLWT to deduct, these are the calculations you need to make. The amounts in these calculations are excluding GST, even if you're not registered for GST. Calculation 1 Sale price × 10% Calculation 2 The greater of: • (sale price less purchase price the vendor originally paid for the property) × RLWT rate, or • zero. Calculation 3 There are 2 options for this calculation depending on who you are. 1. You are the vendor's withholder. The greater of: • sale price less any amounts required to cover any mortgage or other security with a New Zealand registered bank or licensed non-bank deposit taker against the property, and any outstanding local authority rates, or • zero. ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. 2. You are the purchaser, or the purchaser's conveyancer. The greater of: • sale price less any outstanding local authority rates, or • zero. Only work out the RLWT on the offshore RLWT person's share of the property when a property is jointly owned. The lesser amount of all 3 calculations is the amount of RLWT to deduct. Show this amount in the "Amount required to be deducted (in NZ$)" field on the Residential land withholding tax return - IR1100. R LW T r ate For companies, and incorporated clubs and societies, the RLWT rate is 28%. For individuals, all other non-individuals, and companies acting as trustees of a trust, the RLWT rate is 39%. After you've deducted RLWT You need to complete a Residential land withholding tax return - IR1100 and pay the RLWT to us by the 20th of the month after the deductions were made, for example, deductions made in July are due 20 August. The IR1100 has more information on how to file your return and make a payment. Make sure you let the vendor know the amount of RLWT deducted, such as showing it on their settlement statement. They need this amount to complete their end- of-year income tax return. More information When the purchase price is paid in instalments or only a deposit is paid When the purchase price is being paid in instalments or only a deposit is paid, only start deducting RLWT from the payments you receive once 50% of the purchase price has been paid. File an IR1100 and pay the RLWT every month you receive a payment. Residential land withholding tax must be calculated and paid before other disbursements made as part of the settlement process The only exceptions to this are payments: • to cover any mortgage or other security with a New Zealand registered bank or licensed non-bank deposit taken against the property • for outstanding local authority rates. When there is not enough money to pay the RLWT You still need to complete an IR1100 if there is not enough money to pay the RLWT that should've been deducted. Note the actual amount required to be deducted on the IR1100, even if this is zero. You need to attach a letter advising why the amount being paid is less than the amount calculated to be deducted. Penalties and interest Penalties may apply if you do not complete your IR1100 or pay the correct amount of RLWT. Interest may also apply to late payments. For more information about interest and penalties go to ird.govt.nz/rlwt Note: Withholder’s are not liable for the vendor’s RLWT obligations when they have reasonably relied on the IR1101 and accompanying documents.

Individuals Ngā Hunga Takitahi FACTSHEET New Zealand tax residence – new migrants This information sheet explains the New Zealand tax residence rules relevant to new migrants. It also explains what you need to provide to Inland Revenue when requesting confirmation of your tax residence status for your permanent resident visa application with Immigration New Zealand. If you are a New Zealand tax resident 1. In general, if you are a New Zealand tax resident you must pay tax in New Zealand on your worldwide income. 2. Tax residence is also relevant to whether you may be able to receive Working for Families tax credits, including Best Start (a payment for families with a newborn baby). There are other requirements that must also be met, including that you are not in New Zealand on a temporary entry class visa. 3. New migrants may be able to get a temporary tax exemption on most types of foreign income. This temporary exemption lasts for approximately 4 years. 4. If you use the temporary tax exemption, you and your spouse/ partner cannot receive Working for Families tax credits (including Best Start). If either of you apply for Working for Families tax credits, you will lose the temporary tax exemption. You cannot change your mind once you have done this. When you will become a New Zealand tax resident 5. You will become a New Zealand tax resident if you: yhave been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12-month period, or yhave a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. The 183-day rule 6. Most new migrants to New Zealand will become tax resident in New Zealand under the 183-day rule. This is because once you have been in New Zealand for more than 183-days in a 12-month period, your tax residence starts from the first day. 7. Your tax residence could start earlier, if you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand before the first day that is counted for the 183-day rule (see from \[9\]). 8. Because your tax residence starts from the first of the 183- days, you may become tax resident in New Zealand from a date before you moved here. For example, this could happen if you came to New Zealand for a holiday or job interview prior to moving here. Having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand 9. The other way you may become tax resident in New Zealand is by having a permanent place of abode here. 10. You will have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand if you have a house or apartment or other place of abode (a dwelling) in New Zealand where you habitually or usually live. You do not need to live there all the time. 11. It does not matter if you also have a permanent place of abode overseas. As long as you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand you will be tax resident here. It does not matter where you spend more time or which place you consider your main home. 12. You do not need to own a property for it to be your permanent place of abode. It can be a property you rent, hold in a company or trust, or that is owned by a family member. A rented house or apartment can be your permanent place of abode even if you have a periodic tenancy (one that is not for a fixed-term). 13. In determining if you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, all of your circumstances must be considered. This includes: ythe time you spend in New Zealand and away from New Zealand, and yyour overall connections with your place of abode and with New Zealand, such as: your use of the dwelling, what your intentions are (for example, whether you plan to stay in New Zealand or are just here temporarily), what family and social ties you have in New Zealand (for example, if your spouse/partner and children live in New Zealand, membership of clubs etc in New Zealand), whether you have employment, business interests or other economic ties to New Zealand, and where your personal property is located. www.ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication.

You will stop being a New Zealand tax resident if you: ydo not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, and yhave been away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12-month period. 15. If you still have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand you will still be a New Zealand tax resident, even if you are away from New Zealand for more than 325 days. 16. Once you have been away from New Zealand for more than 325-days in a 12-month period, you are non-tax resident in New Zealand from the first day you were away, provided you did not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Confirmation of your tax residence for your permanent resident visa application 17. When you apply for a permanent resident visa, you need to get confirmation from Inland Revenue of your tax residence status. If you need this done urgently, you will need to make an appointment at an Inland Revenue office by phoning 0800 775 247. 18. When you come to Inland Revenue, bring the following documents with you: yConfirmation of Tax Residence Status (INZ 1006) form You can get this form on Immigration New Zealand’s website: Application forms, guides and checklists | Immigration New Zealand yPhoto ID (passport) yCompleted IR886 form You can get this form on Inland Revenue’s website: View all forms and guides (ird.govt.nz) yTravel movements (arrival and departure dates) You can get this from Immigration New Zealand by calling 0508 558 855. Turnaround time can be up to 2 days. 19. If your application is not urgent, you can submit it via a web message sent from your myIR account. You must attach the INZ 1006 form and your travel movement records (arrival and departure dates) from Immigration New Zealand. You may also like to include a completed IR886 form to help us process your application. 20. The criteria you need to meet for Inland Revenue confirmation of your tax residence status are the criteria under New Zealand’s tax laws, which are explained in this information sheet.

IR10G March 2016 IR10 guide Use this guide to help you complete your Financial statements summary (IR10) form 2IR 10 GUIDE Introduction The Financial statements summary (IR10) form collects information for statistical purposes. We use this information to evaluate tax compliance risk, form policy and for strategic research. We pass information on to Statistics New Zealand, which produces a national business database supporting whole-of-government economic, fiscal and monetary decision making. Completing an IR10 helps speed up the processing of tax returns. If an IR10 is completed, financial statements don’t have to be included, although they may be requested later. The IR10 is a summary of the financial statements of a business and does not replace them. Most companies have a statutory obligation to prepare financial statements. The exceptions are companies approved as non-active and very small companies that meet the exemption criteria. For more information, go to our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: financial reporting). All the figures in the IR10 are financial accounting figures, except for: • Box 28 Tax adjustments • Box 29 Current year taxable profit/loss • Box 52 Tax depreciation • Box 59 Tax-deductible – loss on disposal of fixed assets Where financial statements are only prepared using tax concepts to arrive at the income/loss to be returned for tax purposes, the figures from these financial statements should be entered into the IR10. If financial statements haven’t been prepared , fill in the IR10 using information from the trial balance, or financial records. To decide if you need to fill in an IR10, you must determine if you are in business. The Income Tax Act 2007 defines business as including any “profession, trade, or undertaking carried on for profit”. 3www.ird.govt.nz Which returns may require an IR10? If amounts have been entered into these boxes: • IR3 – Boxes 12B, 22, 23 and/or 24 • IR3 NR – Boxes 19, 20 and 21 • IR4 – Boxes 12B, 19B and 21B • IR6 – Boxes 15B and 16B • IR7 – Boxes 10B, 17B, 18B and 19B • IR8 – Boxes 8C, 8D and 8E • IR9 – Boxes 11C or 12C the customer could be in business. You’ll need to consider each case individually to decide if they are. Customers have the option of attaching either: • a fully completed Financial statements summary (IR10) form, or • a set of financial statements. IR10s must be completed before sending E-File returns to Inland Revenue. The IR10 should record GST-exclusive figures, unless the financial statements are prepared on a GST-inclusive basis. Taxable property sales If you’ve shown a net profit or loss from property sales in the “Other income” box of the tax return you may need to complete a Property sale information (IR833) form, even if you’ve included the profit/loss in the IR10. 4IR 10 GUIDE Contents Filling in the boxes Page Box 1 Multiple activity indicator 6 B ox 2 S ales and/or services 6 B ox 3 Opening stock 7 Box 4 Purchases 7 B ox 5 C losing stock 8 B ox 6 G ross profit 8 B ox 7 Interest received 8 Box 8 Dividends received 9 Box 9 Rental, lease and licence income 9 B ox 10 Other income 9 Box 11 Total income 9 Box 12 Bad debts 10 B ox 13 A ccounting depreciation and amortisation 10 B ox 14 Insurance (exclude ACC levies) 10 Box 15 Interest expense 10 Box 16 Professional and consulting fees 10 B ox 17 Rates 10 Box 18 Rental, lease and licence payments 11 Box 19 Repairs and maintenance 11 B ox 20 R esearch and development 11 Box 21 A ssociated persons’ remuneration 11 Box 22 Salaries and wages paid to employees 12 B ox 23 C ontractor and sub-contractor payments 12 B ox 24 O ther expenses 12 Box 25 Total expenses 12 Box 26 Exceptional items 13 Box 27 N et profit/loss before tax 13 B ox 28 T ax adjustments 13 B ox 29 C urrent year taxable profit/loss 14 B ox 30 A ccounts receivable (debtors) 15 B ox 31 C ash and deposits 15 B ox 32 O ther current assets 15 Box 33 Vehicles 15 B ox 34 P lant and machinery 15 5www.ird.govt.nz Box 35 Furniture and fittings 15 Box 36 Land 16 B ox 37 B uildings 16 B ox 38 O ther fixed assets 16 B ox 39 Intangibles 16 B ox 40 S hares/ownership interests 16 B ox 41 T erm deposits 16 B ox 42 Other non-current assets 16 Box 43 Total assets 17 Box 44 Provisions 17 B ox 45 A ccounts payable (creditors) 17 B ox 46 Current loans 17 Box 47 Other current liabilities 17 B ox 48 T otal current liabilities 17 B ox 49 Non-current liabilities 18 Box 50 Total liabilities 18 Box 51 Owners’ equity 18 B ox 52 T ax depreciation 19 B ox 53 U ntaxed realised gains/receipts 19 Box 54 Additions to fixed assets 19 B ox 55 D isposals of fixed assets 19 B ox 56 D ividends paid 20 Box 57 Drawings 20 B ox 58 C urrent account year-end balances 20 B ox 59 T ax-deductible loss on disposal of fixed assets 20 Items listed under boxes 21 Glossary 29 0800 self-service numbers 32 6IR 10 GUIDE Filling in the boxes First fill in the customer’s name and IRD number. 1 Multiple activity indicator Tick “Yes” only if the customer has more than one line of business, not just several different divisions of the same business. Here are some examples: • Customer has a window cleaning business and a painting contractor business – tick “Yes”. • Customer has a supermarket with an alcohol division, a fruit and vegetable division, a delicatessen division and a general grocery division – tick “No”. • Customer has two gift shops, but uses one return – tick “ N o ”. Complete only one IR10 for each return. Profit and loss statement items Boxes 2 to 11 Boxes 2 to 11 relate to the gross income of the business, and should generally be obtained from the profit and loss statement. 2 Sales and/or services This is the gross income from the sale of goods or services as shown in the profit and loss statement. It is also referred to as turnover. Include management fees and commissions if this is the main source of income. Include gross salaries, wages and schedular payments if it is the only income. If there is trading income and gross income such as salary, wages and schedular payments, include them in Box 10 (other income). 7www.ird.govt.nz 3 Opening stock This is the total stock on hand, including raw materials, livestock, grain or produce used in the business, work in progress and finished goods at the beginning of the year. The opening stock figure will generally be the same as the closing stock shown in last year’s comparative figures in the balance sheet (statement of financial position). If the figure cannot be obtained from this source check the cost of goods sold in the profit and loss statement. Work in progress represents the value of work started but not completed. In manufacturing, it is partly finished goods, while in a contracting business, it is incomplete contracts. If the business provides a service, rather than selling goods, there may be no stock. 4 Purchases Enter the total amount of purchases and other direct costs as shown in the profit and loss statement. Sometimes, only the cost of goods sold is shown in the profit and loss statement. In these cases, add closing stock to the cost of goods sold and deduct opening stock. The answer should be treated as purchases, although it may include other direct costs. Direct costs (labour and other) of a business that provides services should be treated as purchases. Do not include purchases of assets where the proceeds of sale of the assets have been included in Box   26 (exceptional items). 8IR 10 GUIDE 5 Closing stock This is the total stock on hand, including raw materials, livestock, grain or produce used in the business on hand, work in progress and finished goods at the end of the year. Work in progress represents the value of work started but not completed. In manufacturing, it is partly finished goods, while in a contracting business, it is incomplete contracts. If the business provides a service, rather than selling goods, there may be no stock. To find the closing stock figure, check the profit and loss statement or current assets in the balance sheet. If the turnover of the business is not more than $1.3 million in the income year and if a reasonable estimate of the value of the closing stock is less than $10,000, the opening stock can be used as the closing stock (refer section EB 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007). 6 Gross profit Enter the total amount of gross profit as shown in the profit and loss statement. The gross profit figure is determined by taking sales and/or services and then deducting the cost of goods sold. The cost of goods sold is calculated by adding opening stock and purchases (including other direct costs) and then deducting closing stock. If the gross profit figure is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. If the opening stock, purchases and closing stock figures cannot be obtained insert the sales and/or services figure shown in Box 2 into Box 6. 7 Interest received Enter the amount of interest income/finance income of the business. You can find this figure in the profit and loss statement. Include interest income from finance leases. 9www.ird.govt.nz 8 Dividends received Enter the amount of dividends received as shown in the profit and loss statement, including inter-group dividends. You can gross up the dividends to the extent that they are taxable and the imputation credits are available to satisfy the business’s income or tax liability. Or you can account for the taxable dividends on a net basis and make a tax adjustment for any imputation credits. Businesses that must prepare general purpose financial statements that comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) must account for imputation credits on a net basis as required by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 9 Rental, lease and licence income Enter the amount of gross rental, lease, licence and hire income before expenses as shown in the profit and loss statement. Include income from land, buildings, vehicles, fishing quotas and stud fees. Licence income includes franchise fees and royalties. If licence income or hiring activities are part of normal business activities the income should be included in Box 2 (sales and/or services). Don’t include income from hire purchase and finance lease agreements, but show the interest portion of these receipts in Box 7 (interest received). 10 Other income Enter all other income shown in the profit and loss statement that has not been included in Boxes 2 and 6 to 9. This includes any taxable property income. Include salary, wages and schedular payments that have been included in the profit and loss statement where they have not already been recorded in Box 2 (sales and/or services). Do not include exceptional items that must be included in Box 26. 11 Total income This figure includes all income shown in Boxes 6 to 10. It should be equal to the total income shown in the profit and loss statement, excluding exceptional items. If the total income is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. 10IR 10 GUIDE Boxes 12 to 24 Boxes 12 to 24 relate to the expenses of the business that are generally shown in the profit and loss statement. If a specific expense in Boxes 12 to 24 has been treated as a direct cost in the profit and loss statement it will already have been accounted for in calculating the gross profit at Box 6 and should not be included again within Boxes 12 to 24. 12 Bad debts Enter the total amount of bad debts written off for financial accounting purposes. Don’t include doubtful debts or debt collection fees. 13 Accounting depreciation and amortisation Enter the total amount of accounting depreciation and amortisation as shown in the profit and loss statement. Where tax depreciation rates were adopted for accounting purposes this figure will be the same as Box 52. 14 Insurance (exclude ACC levies) Enter the insurance premiums that were treated as an expense for financial accounting purposes. Do not include ACC levies, which should be included in Box 22 (salaries and wages paid to employees). 15 Interest expense Enter the total amount of interest expense/finance expense as shown in the profit and loss statement. 16 Professional and consulting fees Professional fees include accounting, legal fees and taxation advice. Consulting fees include: management advice, financial advisory fees, assistance with feasibility studies, and advice concerning mergers, acquisitions, financing and restructuring. This expense categorisation includes all fees that have been expensed, but not capitalised to the balance sheet. 17 Rates Enter the total amount of rates paid to local authorities that were treated as an expense for financial accounting purposes. 11www.ird.govt.nz 18 Rental, lease and licence payments Enter the total amount of rental, hire, lease and licence payments as shown in the financial statements. Don’t net these expenses against rental, lease and licence income (Box 9). Rental, hire and lease payments can be made for items such as buildings, vehicles and equipment. Licence payments include franchise fees, royalties and licence fees. 19 Repairs and maintenance Enter the total amount of repairs and maintenance expenditure as shown in the financial statements. 20 Research and development Enter the total amount of research and development expenditure that has been treated as an expense in the financial statements. The expenditure should include all scientific and technological research and development. 21 Associated persons’ remuneration For this expense, “associated persons” has the same meaning as in subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007. For more guidance please refer to A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes (IR620). “Associated persons” can include persons and entities, for example, individuals, companies, trustees, partnerships and limited partnerships. Enter the total amount of remuneration, which has been treated as an expense in the financial statements and paid for services performed by the owner of the business (including sole trader) and/or associated persons’. In a small family owned business the remuneration includes regular payments of salaries and wages as well as lump sum payments (whether PAYE was deducted or not). It also includes management fees (whether paid to individuals or associated persons) and directors’ fees paid to associated persons. For a widely owned business (such as a listed company) and/or an overseas owned business, the associated persons’ remuneration will consist of management fees paid to associated persons. 12IR 10 GUIDE For simplicity, you can exclude indirect remuneration such as ACC levies, FBT and employer contributions to superannuation/KiwiSaver from the associated persons’ remuneration. These exclusions are to minimise compliance costs arising from apportionment. Instead, you can enter these indirect remuneration expenses in the “Other expenses” box on your IR10. Remuneration in this context does not include dividends, drawings, interest or royalties. 22 Salaries and wages paid to employees Enter the total amount of salaries and wages paid to employees that have been treated as an expense in the financial statements. Salaries and wages include PAYE, bonuses and other indirect employment costs such as KiwiSaver contributions and ACC levies. They do not include associated persons’ remuneration. 23 Contractor and sub-contractor payments Enter the total amount of contractor and sub-contractor payments shown in the financial statements. These payments include agricultural and construction subcontractors, schedular payments, relief taxi and courier drivers, temporary contractors (“temps”), and labour-only contractors. Do not include associated persons’ remuneration and salaries and wages paid to employees. 24 Other expenses Include any other expenses in the profit and loss statement that have not been included in Boxes 4 and 12 to 23. 25 Total expenses This is the sum of all expenses shown in Boxes 12 to 24. 13www.ird.govt.nz 26 Exceptional items These are large income and/or expense items that do not arise as a result of normal business operations and are not expected to recur. In particular, the following six income and/ or expense categories are exceptional items: 1. R esults from the sale or disposal of the business or a significant part of it; 2. R esults from natural disasters, i.e. Acts of God 3. Major restructuring costs paid or provided for 4. Major impairments or write-offs 5. R eversal of major impairments, write-offs or restructuring provisions 6. Large one-off non-operational receipts. For the purposes of this disclosure, only disclose exceptional items if the income and/or expense items in the above six categories total more than 5% of turnover. If the net exceptional items are a negative amount, put a minus sign in the last box. 27 Net profit/loss before tax This is the total of Box 11 (total income) less Box 25 (total expenses) and then adding Box 26 (exceptional items) if it is a positive amount, or deducting Box 26 if it is a negative amount. The net profit/loss before tax should be the same as the net profit/loss before tax shown in the profit and loss statement. If there is a net loss before tax, put a minus sign in the last box. 28 Tax adjustments These are the total of all the adjustments that are required to go from the net profit/loss before tax as shown in Box 27 to the total current year taxable profit/loss as shown in Box 29. The tax adjustments figure may be positive (add to net profit) or negative (deduct from net profit). If it is negative put a minus sign after Box 28. If there is no difference between Box 27 and Box 29 leave Box 28 blank. 14IR 10 GUIDE Examples of common causes of tax adjustments are differences between accounting and tax depreciation, tax depreciation recovered, capital gains and losses on sale of assets, provisions not incurred at balance date, tax-exempt inter-company dividends and non-deductible expenditure such as entertainment. Tax adjustments may also be required for items not included in the profit and loss statement. Examples include imputation credits attached to dividends received, fair dividend rate income and income earned by sole traders that has not been included in the financial statements e.g. interest and dividends. 29 Current year taxable profit/loss Enter the taxable profit/loss figure from the tax return. This figure should be equal to the net profit/loss before tax in Box 27 plus or minus the tax adjustments shown in Box 28. It should be before inter-group company loss offsets and the utilisation of any losses carried forward. The figure should be the same as: IR3 – Box 27 IR3NR – Box 24 IR4 – Box 24 IR6 – The sum of Box 17B (total income), minus Box 19 (expenses claimed) IR7 – Box 22 IR8 – Box 8J IR9 – Box 15 If there is a tax loss for the current year, put a minus sign in the last box.

IR10G March 2020 IR10 guide Use this guide to help you complete your Financial statements summary - IR10 form 2 IR 10 GUIDE Introduction The Financial statements summary - IR10 form collects information for statistical purposes. We use this information to evaluate tax compliance risk, form policy and for strategic research. We pass information on to Statistics New Zealand, which produces a national business database supporting whole-of-government economic, fiscal and monetary decision making. Completing an IR10 helps speed up the processing of tax returns. If an IR10 is completed, financial statements don’t have to be included, although they may be requested later. The IR10 is a summary of the financial statements of a business and does not replace them. Most companies have a statutory obligation to prepare financial statements. The exceptions are companies approved as non-active and very small companies that meet the exemption criteria. For more information, go to our website ird.govt.nz/records All the figures in the IR10 are financial accounting figures, except for: • • Box 28 Tax adjustments • • Box 29 Current year taxable profit/loss • • Box 52 Tax depreciation • • Box 59 Tax-deductible – loss on disposal of fixed assets Where financial statements are only prepared using tax concepts to arrive at the income/loss to be returned for tax purposes, the figures from these financial statements should be entered into the IR10. If financial statements haven’t been prepared , fill in the IR10 using information from the trial balance, or financial records. To decide if you need to fill in an IR10, you must determine if you are in business. The Income Tax Act 2007 defines business as including any “profession, trade, or undertaking carried on for profit”. 3ird.govt.nz Which returns may require an IR10? If amounts have been entered into these boxes: • • IR3 – Boxes 12B, 22A, 23, 24 25B and/or 26 • • IR3NR – Boxes 19A, 20, 21, 22B and 23 • • IR4 – Boxes 12B, 19A, 20B, 21B and 23B • • IR6 – Boxes 15A, 16B, 17B and 18B • • IR7 – Boxes 10B, 17B, 18B, 19B, 20B and 21B • • IR8 – Boxes 8A, 9, 10C, 10D and 10E • • IR9 – Boxes 10A, 11, 13C and 14C the customer could be in business.

Here are some examples: • • Customer has a window cleaning business and a painting contractor business – tick “Yes”. • • Customer has a supermarket with an alcohol division, a fruit and vegetable division, a delicatessen division and a general grocery division – tick “No”. • • Customer has two gift shops, but uses one return – tick “ N o ”. Complete only one IR10 for each return. Profit and loss statement items Boxes 2 to 11 Boxes 2 to 11 relate to the gross income of the business, and should generally be obtained from the profit and loss statement. 2 Sales and/or services This is the gross income from the sale of goods or services as shown in the profit and loss statement. It is also referred to as turnover. Include management fees and commissions if this is the main source of income. Include gross salaries, wages and schedular payments if it is the only income. If there is trading income and gross income such as salary, wages and schedular payments, include them in Box 10 (other income). 7ird.govt.nz 3 Opening stock This is the total stock on hand, including raw materials, livestock, grain or produce used in the business, work in progress and finished goods at the beginning of the year. The opening stock figure will generally be the same as the closing stock shown in last year’s comparative figures in the balance sheet (statement of financial position). If the figure cannot be obtained from this source check the cost of goods sold in the profit and loss statement. Work in progress represents the value of work started but not completed. In manufacturing, it is partly finished goods, while in a contracting business, it is incomplete contracts. If the business provides a service, rather than selling goods, there may be no stock. 4 Purchases Enter the total amount of purchases and other direct costs as shown in the profit and loss statement. Sometimes, only the cost of goods sold is shown in the profit and loss statement. In these cases, add closing stock to the cost of goods sold and deduct opening stock. The answer should be treated as purchases, although it may include other direct costs. Direct costs (labour and other) of a business that provides services should be treated as purchases. Do not include purchases of assets where the proceeds of sale of the assets have been included in Box   26 (exceptional items). 8 IR 10 GUIDE 5 Closing stock This is the total stock on hand, including raw materials, livestock, grain or produce used in the business on hand, work in progress and finished goods at the end of the year. Work in progress represents the value of work started but not completed. In manufacturing, it is partly finished goods, while in a contracting business, it is incomplete contracts. If the business provides a service, rather than selling goods, there may be no stock. To find the closing stock figure, check the profit and loss statement or current assets in the balance sheet. If the turnover of the business is not more than $1.3 million in the income year and if a reasonable estimate of the value of the closing stock is less than $10,000, the opening stock can be used as the closing stock (refer section EB 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007). 6 Gross profit Enter the total amount of gross profit as shown in the profit and loss statement. The gross profit figure is determined by taking sales and/or services and then deducting the cost of goods sold. The cost of goods sold is calculated by adding opening stock and purchases (including other direct costs) and then deducting closing stock. If the gross profit figure is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. If the opening stock, purchases and closing stock figures cannot be obtained insert the sales and/or services figure shown in Box 2 into Box 6. 7 Interest received Enter the amount of interest income/finance income of the business. You can find this figure in the profit and loss statement. Include interest income from finance leases. 9ird.govt.nz 8 Dividends received Enter the amount of dividends received as shown in the profit and loss statement, including inter-group dividends. You can gross up the dividends to the extent that they are taxable and the imputation credits are available to satisfy the business’s income or tax liability. Or you can account for the taxable dividends on a net basis and make a tax adjustment for any imputation credits. Businesses that must prepare general purpose financial statements that comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) must account for imputation credits on a net basis as required by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 9 Rental, lease and licence income Enter the amount of gross rental, lease, licence and hire income before expenses as shown in the profit and loss statement. Include income from land, buildings, vehicles, fishing quotas and stud fees. Licence income includes franchise fees and royalties. If licence income or hiring activities are part of normal business activities the income should be included in Box 2 (sales and/or services). Don’t include income from hire purchase and finance lease agreements, but show the interest portion of these receipts in Box 7 (interest received). 10 Other income Enter all other income shown in the profit and loss statement that has not been included in Boxes 2 and 6 to 9. This includes any taxable property income. Include salary, wages and schedular payments that have been included in the profit and loss statement where they have not already been recorded in Box 2 (sales and/or services). Do not include exceptional items that must be included in Box 26. 11 Total income This figure includes all income shown in Boxes 6 to 10. It should be equal to the total income shown in the profit and loss statement, excluding exceptional items. If the total income is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. 10 IR 10 GUIDE Boxes 12 to 24 Boxes 12 to 24 relate to the expenses of the business that are generally shown in the profit and loss statement. If a specific expense in Boxes 12 to 24 has been treated as a direct cost in the profit and loss statement it will already have been accounted for in calculating the gross profit at Box 6 and should not be included again within Boxes 12 to 24. 12 Bad debts Enter the total amount of bad debts written off for financial accounting purposes. Don’t include doubtful debts or debt collection fees. 13 Accounting depreciation and amortisation Enter the total amount of accounting depreciation and amortisation as shown in the profit and loss statement. Where tax depreciation rates were adopted for accounting purposes this figure will be the same as Box 52. 14 Insurance (exclude ACC levies) Enter the insurance premiums that were treated as an expense for financial accounting purposes. Do not include ACC levies, which should be included in Box 22 (salaries and wages paid to employees). 15 Interest expense Enter the total amount of interest expense/finance expense as shown in the profit and loss statement. 16 Professional and consulting fees Professional fees include accounting, legal fees and taxation advice. Consulting fees include: management advice, financial advisory fees, assistance with feasibility studies, and advice concerning mergers, acquisitions, financing and restructuring. This expense categorisation includes all fees that have been expensed, but not capitalised to the balance sheet. 17 Rates Enter the total amount of rates paid to local authorities that were treated as an expense for financial accounting purposes. 11ird.govt.nz 18 Rental, lease and licence payments Enter the total amount of rental, hire, lease and licence payments as shown in the financial statements. Don’t net these expenses against rental, lease and licence income (Box 9). Rental, hire and lease payments can be made for items such as buildings, vehicles and equipment. Licence payments include franchise fees, royalties and licence fees. 19 Repairs and maintenance Enter the total amount of repairs and maintenance expenditure as shown in the financial statements. 20 Research and development Enter the total amount of research and development expenditure that has been treated as an expense in the financial statements. The expenditure should include all scientific and technological research and development. 21 Associated persons’ remuneration For this expense, “associated persons” has the same meaning as in subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007. For more guidance please refer to IR620 - Associated persons definitions for income tax purposes. “Associated persons” can include persons and entities, for example, individuals, companies, trustees, partnerships and limited partnerships. Enter the total amount of remuneration, which has been treated as an expense in the financial statements and paid for services performed by the owner of the business (including sole trader) and/or associated persons’. In a small family owned business the remuneration includes regular payments of salaries and wages as well as lump sum payments (whether PAYE was deducted or not). It also includes management fees (whether paid to individuals or associated persons) and directors’ fees paid to associated persons. For a widely owned business (such as a listed company) and/or an overseas owned business, the associated persons’ remuneration will consist of management fees paid to associated persons. 12 IR 10 GUIDE For simplicity, you can exclude indirect remuneration such as ACC levies, FBT and employer contributions to superannuation/KiwiSaver from the associated persons’ remuneration. These exclusions are to minimise compliance costs arising from apportionment. Instead, you can enter these indirect remuneration expenses in the “Other expenses” box on your IR10. Remuneration in this context does not include dividends, drawings, interest or royalties. 22 Salaries and wages paid to employees Enter the total amount of salaries and wages paid to employees that have been treated as an expense in the financial statements. Salaries and wages include PAYE, bonuses and other indirect employment costs such as KiwiSaver contributions and ACC levies. They do not include associated persons’ remuneration. 23 Contractor and sub-contractor payments Enter the total amount of contractor and sub-contractor payments shown in the financial statements. These payments include agricultural and construction subcontractors, schedular payments, relief taxi and courier drivers, temporary contractors (“temps”), and labour-only contractors. Do not include associated persons’ remuneration and salaries and wages paid to employees. 24 Other expenses Include any other expenses in the profit and loss statement that have not been included in Boxes 4 and 12 to 23. 25 Total expenses This is the sum of all expenses shown in Boxes 12 to 24. 13ird.govt.nz 26 Exceptional items These are large income and/or expense items that do not arise as a result of normal business operations and are not expected to recur. In particular, the following six income and/ or expense categories are exceptional items: 1. Results from the sale or disposal of the business or a significant part of it; 2. Results from natural disasters, i.e. Acts of God 3. Major restructuring costs paid or provided for 4. Major impairments or write-offs 5. Reversal of major impairments, write-offs or restructuring provisions 6. Large one-off non-operational receipts. For the purposes of this disclosure, only disclose exceptional items if the income and/or expense items in the above six categories total more than 5% of turnover. If the net exceptional items are a negative amount, put a minus sign in the last box. 27 Net profit/loss before tax This is the total of Box 11 (total income) less Box 25 (total expenses) and then adding Box 26 (exceptional items) if it is a positive amount, or deducting Box 26 if it is a negative amount. The net profit/loss before tax should be the same as the net profit/loss before tax shown in the profit and loss statement. If there is a net loss before tax, put a minus sign in the last box. 28 Tax adjustments These are the total of all the adjustments that are required to go from the net profit/loss before tax as shown in Box 27 to the total current year taxable profit/loss as shown in Box 29. The tax adjustments figure may be positive (add to net profit) or negative (deduct from net profit). If it is negative put a minus sign after Box 28. If there is no difference between Box 27 and Box 29 leave Box 28 blank. 14 IR 10 GUIDE Examples of common causes of tax adjustments are differences between accounting and tax depreciation, tax depreciation recovered, capital gains and losses on sale of assets, provisions not incurred at balance date, tax-exempt inter-company dividends and non-deductible expenditure such as entertainment. Tax adjustments may also be required for items not included in the profit and loss statement. Examples include imputation credits attached to dividends received, fair dividend rate income and income earned by sole traders that has not been included in the financial statements e.g. interest and dividends. 29 Current year taxable profit/loss Enter the taxable profit/loss figure from the tax return. This figure should be equal to the net profit/loss before tax in Box 27 plus or minus the tax adjustments shown in Box 28. It should be before inter-group company loss offsets and the utilisation of any losses carried forward. The figure should be the same as: IR3 – Box 29 IR3NR – Box 26 IR4 – Box 26 IR6 – The sum of Box 19B (total income), minus Box 21 (expenses claimed) IR7 – Box 24 IR8 – Box 10J IR9 – Box 17 If there is a tax loss for the current year, put a minus sign in the last box.

IR10G August 2022 IR10 guide Use this guide to help you complete your Financial statements summary - IR10 form 2 IR 10 GUIDE Introduction The Financial statements summary - IR10 form collects information for statistical purposes. We use this information to evaluate tax compliance risk, form policy and for strategic research. We pass information on to Statistics New Zealand, which produces a national business database supporting whole-of-government economic, fiscal and monetary decision making. Completing an IR10 helps speed up the processing of tax returns. If an IR10 is completed, financial statements don’t have to be included, although they may be requested later. The IR10 is a summary of the financial statements of a business and does not replace them. Most companies have a statutory obligation to prepare financial statements. The exceptions are companies approved as non-active and very small companies that meet the exemption criteria. For more information, go to our website ird.govt.nz/records All the figures in the IR10 are financial accounting figures, except for: • • Box 28 Tax adjustments • • Box 29 Current year taxable profit/loss • • Box 52 Tax depreciation • • Box 59 Tax-deductible – loss on disposal of fixed assets Where financial statements are only prepared using tax concepts to arrive at the income/loss to be returned for tax purposes, the figures from these financial statements should be entered into the IR10. If financial statements haven’t been prepared , fill in the IR10 using information from the trial balance, or financial records. To decide if you need to fill in an IR10, you must determine if you are in business. The Income Tax Act 2007 defines business as including any “profession, trade, or undertaking carried on for profit”. 3ird.govt.nz Which returns may require an IR10?

Complete only one IR10 for each return. Profit and loss statement items Boxes 2 to 11 Boxes 2 to 11 relate to the gross income of the business, and should generally be obtained from the profit and loss statement. 2 Sales and/or services This is the gross income from the sale of goods or services as shown in the profit and loss statement. It is also referred to as turnover. Include management fees and commissions if this is the main source of income. Include gross salaries, wages and schedular payments if it is the only income. If there is trading income and gross income such as salary, wages and schedular payments, include them in Box 10 (other income). 7ird.govt.nz 3 Opening stock This is the total stock on hand, including raw materials, livestock, grain or produce used in the business, work in progress and finished goods at the beginning of the year. The opening stock figure will generally be the same as the closing stock shown in last year’s comparative figures in the balance sheet (statement of financial position). If the figure cannot be obtained from this source check the cost of goods sold in the profit and loss statement. Work in progress represents the value of work started but not completed. In manufacturing, it is partly finished goods, while in a contracting business, it is incomplete contracts. If the business provides a service, rather than selling goods, there may be no stock. 4 Purchases Enter the total amount of purchases and other direct costs as shown in the profit and loss statement. Sometimes, only the cost of goods sold is shown in the profit and loss statement. In these cases, add closing stock to the cost of goods sold and deduct opening stock. The answer should be treated as purchases, although it may include other direct costs. Direct costs (labour and other) of a business that provides services should be treated as purchases. Do not include purchases of assets where the proceeds of sale of the assets have been included in Box   26 (exceptional items). 8 IR 10 GUIDE 5 Closing stock This is the total stock on hand, including raw materials, livestock, grain or produce used in the business on hand, work in progress and finished goods at the end of the year. Work in progress represents the value of work started but not completed. In manufacturing, it is partly finished goods, while in a contracting business, it is incomplete contracts. If the business provides a service, rather than selling goods, there may be no stock. To find the closing stock figure, check the profit and loss statement or current assets in the balance sheet. If the turnover of the business is not more than $1.3 million in the income year and if a reasonable estimate of the value of the closing stock is less than $10,000, the opening stock can be used as the closing stock (refer section EB 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007). 6 Gross profit Enter the total amount of gross profit as shown in the profit and loss statement. The gross profit figure is determined by taking sales and/or services and then deducting the cost of goods sold. The cost of goods sold is calculated by adding opening stock and purchases (including other direct costs) and then deducting closing stock. If the gross profit figure is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. If the opening stock, purchases and closing stock figures cannot be obtained insert the sales and/or services figure shown in Box 2 into Box 6. 7 Interest received Enter the amount of interest income/finance income of the business. You can find this figure in the profit and loss statement. Include interest income from finance leases. 9ird.govt.nz 8 Dividends received Enter the amount of dividends received as shown in the profit and loss statement, including inter-group dividends. You can gross up the dividends to the extent that they are taxable and the imputation credits are available to satisfy the business’s income or tax liability.

Businesses that must prepare general purpose financial statements that comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) must account for imputation credits on a net basis as required by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 9 Rental, lease and licence income Enter the amount of gross rental, lease, licence and hire income before expenses as shown in the profit and loss statement. Include income from land, buildings, vehicles, fishing quotas and stud fees. Licence income includes franchise fees and royalties. If licence income or hiring activities are part of normal business activities the income should be included in Box 2 (sales and/or services).

IR10G June 2023 IR10 guide Use this guide to help you complete your Financial statements summary - IR10 form 2 3 ird.govt.nzIR 10 GUIDE Introduction The Financial statements summary - IR10 form collects information for statistical purposes. We use this information to evaluate tax compliance risk, form policy and for strategic research. We pass information on to Statistics New Zealand, which produces a national business database supporting whole-of-government economic, fiscal and monetary decision making. Completing an IR10 helps speed up the processing of tax returns. If an IR10 is completed, financial statements don’t have to be included, although they may be requested later. The IR10 is a summary of the financial statements of a business and does not replace them. Most companies have a statutory obligation to prepare financial statements. The exceptions are companies approved as non-active and very small companies that meet the exemption criteria. For more information, go to our website ird.govt.nz/records All the figures in the IR10 are financial accounting figures, except for: • • Box 28 Tax adjustments • • Box 29 Current year taxable profit/loss • • Box 52 Tax depreciation • • Box 59 Tax-deductible – loss on disposal of fixed assets Where financial statements are only prepared using tax concepts to arrive at the income/loss to be returned for tax purposes, the figures from these financial statements should be entered into the IR10. If financial statements haven’t been prepared , fill in the IR10 using information from the trial balance, or financial records. To decide if you need to fill in an IR10, you must determine if you are in business. The Income Tax Act 2007 defines business as including any “profession, trade, or undertaking carried on for profit”. Which returns may require an IR10? If amounts have been entered into these boxes: • • IR3 – Boxes 12B, 22D, 24, 25, 26B and/or 28 • • IR3NR – Boxes 22D, 24, 25, 26B and 28 • • IR4 – Boxes 12B, 19D, 21B, 22B and 24B • • IR6 – Boxes 15D, 17B, 18B and 19B • • IR7 – Boxes 10B, 17B, 18E, 20B, 21B and 22B • • IR8 – Boxes 8D, 10, 11C, 11D and 11E • • IR9 – Boxes 10D, 12, 14C and 15C the customer could be in business.

Complete only one IR10 for each return. Profit and loss statement items Boxes 2 to 11 Boxes 2 to 11 relate to the gross income of the business, and should generally be obtained from the profit and loss statement. 2 Sales and/or services This is the gross income from the sale of goods or services as shown in the profit and loss statement. It is also referred to as turnover. Include management fees and commissions if this is the main source of income. Include gross salaries, wages and schedular payments if it is the only income. If there is trading income and gross income such as salary, wages and schedular payments, include them in Box 10 (other income). 3 Opening stock This is the total stock on hand, including raw materials, livestock, grain or produce used in the business, work in progress and finished goods at the beginning of the year. The opening stock figure will generally be the same as the closing stock shown in last year’s comparative figures in the balance sheet (statement of financial position). If the figure cannot be obtained from this source check the cost of goods sold in the profit and loss statement. Work in progress represents the value of work started but not completed. In manufacturing, it is partly finished goods, while in a contracting business, it is incomplete contracts. If the business provides a service, rather than selling goods, there may be no stock. 4 Purchases Enter the total amount of purchases and other direct costs as shown in the profit and loss statement. Sometimes, only the cost of goods sold is shown in the profit and loss statement. In these cases, add closing stock to the cost of goods sold and deduct opening stock. The answer should be treated as purchases, although it may include other direct costs. Direct costs (labour and other) of a business that provides services should be treated as purchases. Do not include purchases of assets where the proceeds of sale of the assets have been included in Box   26 (exceptional items). 8 9 ird.govt.nzIR 10 GUIDE 5 Closing stock This is the total stock on hand, including raw materials, livestock, grain or produce used in the business on hand, work in progress and finished goods at the end of the year. Work in progress represents the value of work started but not completed. In manufacturing, it is partly finished goods, while in a contracting business, it is incomplete contracts. If the business provides a service, rather than selling goods, there may be no stock. To find the closing stock figure, check the profit and loss statement or current assets in the balance sheet. If the turnover of the business is not more than $1.3 million in the income year and if a reasonable estimate of the value of the closing stock is less than $10,000, the opening stock can be used as the closing stock (refer section EB 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007). 6 Gross profit Enter the total amount of gross profit as shown in the profit and loss statement. The gross profit figure is determined by taking sales and/or services and then deducting the cost of goods sold. The cost of goods sold is calculated by adding opening stock and purchases (including other direct costs) and then deducting closing stock. If the gross profit figure is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. If the opening stock, purchases and closing stock figures cannot be obtained insert the sales and/or services figure shown in Box 2 into Box 6. 7 Interest received Enter the amount of interest income/finance income of the business. You can find this figure in the profit and loss statement. Include interest income from finance leases. 8 Dividends received Enter the amount of dividends received as shown in the profit and loss statement, including inter-group dividends. You can gross up the dividends to the extent that they are taxable and the imputation credits are available to satisfy the business’s income or tax liability. Or you can account for the taxable dividends on a net basis and make a tax adjustment for any imputation credits. Businesses that must prepare general purpose financial statements that comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) must account for imputation credits on a net basis as required by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 9 Rental, lease and licence income Enter the amount of gross rental, lease, licence and hire income before expenses as shown in the profit and loss statement. Include income from land, buildings, vehicles, fishing quotas and stud fees. Licence income includes franchise fees and royalties. If licence income or hiring activities are part of normal business activities the income should be included in Box 2 (sales and/or services). Don’t include income from hire purchase and finance lease agreements, but show the interest portion of these receipts in Box 7 (interest received). 10 Other income Enter all other income shown in the profit and loss statement that has not been included in Boxes 2 and 6 to 9. This includes any taxable property income. Include salary, wages and schedular payments that have been included in the profit and loss statement where they have not already been recorded in Box 2 (sales and/or services). Do not include exceptional items that must be included in Box 26. 11 Total income This figure includes all income shown in Boxes 6 to 10. It should be equal to the total income shown in the profit and loss statement, excluding exceptional items. If the total income is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. 10 11 ird.govt.nzIR 10 GUIDE Boxes 12 to 24 Boxes 12 to 24 relate to the expenses of the business that are generally shown in the profit and loss statement. If a specific expense in Boxes 12 to 24 has been treated as a direct cost in the profit and loss statement it will already have been accounted for in calculating the gross profit at Box 6 and should not be included again within Boxes 12 to 24. 12 Bad debts Enter the total amount of bad debts written off for financial accounting purposes. Don’t include doubtful debts or debt collection fees. 13 Accounting depreciation and amortisation Enter the total amount of accounting depreciation and amortisation as shown in the profit and loss statement. Where tax depreciation rates were adopted for accounting purposes this figure will be the same as Box 52. 14 Insurance (exclude ACC levies) Enter the insurance premiums that were treated as an expense for financial accounting purposes. Do not include ACC levies, which should be included in Box 22 (salaries and wages paid to employees). 15 Interest expense Enter the total amount of interest expense/finance expense as shown in the profit and loss statement. 16 Professional and consulting fees Professional fees include accounting, legal fees and taxation advice. Consulting fees include: management advice, financial advisory fees, assistance with feasibility studies, and advice concerning mergers, acquisitions, financing and restructuring. This expense categorisation includes all fees that have been expensed, but not capitalised to the balance sheet. 17 Rates Enter the total amount of rates paid to local authorities that were treated as an expense for financial accounting purposes. 18 Rental, lease and licence payments Enter the total amount of rental, hire, lease and licence payments as shown in the financial statements.

Licence payments include franchise fees, royalties and licence fees. 19 Repairs and maintenance Enter the total amount of repairs and maintenance expenditure as shown in the financial statements. 20 Research and development Enter the total amount of research and development expenditure that has been treated as an expense in the financial statements. The expenditure should include all scientific and technological research and development. 21 Associated persons’ remuneration For this expense, “associated persons” has the same meaning as in subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007. For more guidance please refer to IR620 - Associated persons definitions for income tax purposes. “Associated persons” can include persons and entities, for example, individuals, companies, trustees, partnerships and limited partnerships. Enter the total amount of remuneration, which has been treated as an expense in the financial statements and paid for services performed by the owner of the business (including sole trader) and/or associated persons’. In a small family owned business the remuneration includes regular payments of salaries and wages as well as lump sum payments (whether PAYE was deducted or not). It also includes management fees (whether paid to individuals or associated persons) and directors’ fees paid to associated persons. For a widely owned business (such as a listed company) and/or an overseas owned business, the associated persons’ remuneration will consist of management fees paid to associated persons. 12 13 ird.govt.nzIR 10 GUIDE For simplicity, you can exclude indirect remuneration such as ACC levies, FBT and employer contributions to superannuation/KiwiSaver from the associated persons’ remuneration. These exclusions are to minimise compliance costs arising from apportionment. Instead, you can enter these indirect remuneration expenses in box 24 on your IR10. Remuneration in this context does not include dividends, drawings, interest or royalties. 22 Salaries and wages paid to employees Enter the total amount of salaries and wages paid to employees that have been treated as an expense in the financial statements. Salaries and wages include PAYE, bonuses and other indirect employment costs such as KiwiSaver contributions and ACC levies. They do not include associated persons’ remuneration. 23 Contractor and sub-contractor payments Enter the total amount of contractor and sub-contractor payments shown in the financial statements. These payments include agricultural and construction subcontractors, schedular payments, relief taxi and courier drivers, temporary contractors (“temps”), and labour-only contractors. Do not include associated persons’ remuneration and salaries and wages paid to employees. 24 Other expenses Include any other expenses in the profit and loss statement that have not been included in Boxes 4 and 12 to 23. 25 Total expenses This is the sum of all expenses shown in Boxes 12 to 24. 26 Exceptional items These are large income and/or expense items that do not arise as a result of normal business operations and are not expected to recur. In particular, the following six income and/ or expense categories are exceptional items: 1. Results from the sale or disposal of the business or a significant part of it; 2. Results from natural disasters, i.e. Acts of God 3. Major restructuring costs paid or provided for 4. Major impairments or write-offs 5. Reversal of major impairments, write-offs or restructuring provisions 6. Large one-off non-operational receipts. For the purposes of this disclosure, only disclose exceptional items if the income and/or expense items in the above six categories total more than 5% of turnover. If the net exceptional items are a negative amount, put a minus sign in the last box. 27 Net profit/loss before tax This is the total of Box 11 (total income) less Box 25 (total expenses) and then adding Box 26 (exceptional items) if it is a positive amount, or deducting Box 26 if it is a negative amount. The net profit/loss before tax should be the same as the net profit/loss before tax shown in the profit and loss statement. If there is a net loss before tax, put a minus sign in the last box. 28 Tax adjustments These are the total of all the adjustments that are required to go from the net profit/loss before tax as shown in Box 27 to the total current year taxable profit/loss as shown in Box 29. The tax adjustments figure may be positive (add to net profit) or negative (deduct from net profit). If it is negative put a minus sign after Box 28. If there is no difference between Box 27 and Box 29 leave Box 28 blank. 14 15 ird.govt.nzIR 10 GUIDE Examples of common causes of tax adjustments are differences between accounting and tax depreciation, tax depreciation recovered, capital gains and losses on sale of assets, provisions not incurred at balance date, tax-exempt inter-company dividends and non-deductible expenditure such as entertainment. Tax adjustments may also be required for items not included in the profit and loss statement. Examples include imputation credits attached to dividends received, fair dividend rate income and income earned by sole traders that has not been included in the financial statements e.g. interest and dividends. 29 Current year taxable profit/loss Enter the taxable profit/loss figure from the tax return. This figure should be equal to the net profit/loss before tax in Box 27 plus or minus the tax adjustments shown in Box 28. It should be before inter-group company loss offsets and the utilisation of any losses carried forward. The figure should be the same as: IR3 – Box 31 IR3NR – Box 31 IR4 – Box 27 IR6 – The sum of Box 20B (total income), minus Box 22 (expenses claimed) IR7 – Box 25 IR8 – Box 11J IR9 – Box 18 If there is a tax loss for the current year, put a minus sign in the last box.

Type of paymentRLWT liability occurs when: Monetary50% or more of the sale price has been paid to the seller or the seller's conveyancer Giftingthe gift becomes effective For other situations you'll need to talk to a tax professional. Bright-line start date Use the following table to determine what date to use as the bright-line start date. Type of purchase/acquisitionDate to use Standard purchase of a propertyDate the transfer of the property is registered to you with Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) (usually the settlement date) Subdivided land – property you have subdividedThe original date of registration for the undivided property Off the plans – property acquired relying on the completion of a land development or subdivision Date you entered into a sale and purchase agreement Change of trustee – land transferred from a trustee of a trust to another trustee of the trust Bright-line start date for the original trustee Joint tenancy converted to a tenancy in common or tenancy in common converted to a joint tenancy To the extent the person’s share in the land is unchanged, the bright-line start date for the land before the tenancy was converted Purchase where no registration happens before the sale dateDate you acquired an interest in the property Freehold estate converted from a lease with a perpetual right of renewal Date you were first granted the leasehold estate Land outside New ZealandDate the transfer of the property is registered to you under foreign laws Bright-line end date Use the following table to determine what date to use as the bright-line end date. Type of sale/disposalDate to use Standard sale of a propertyDate you entered into a sale and purchase agreement Gifting of propertyDate the gift was made Compulsory acquisition by the Crown, a local authority, or a public authority Date of compulsory acquisition Mortgagee saleDate the property is disposed of by or for the mortgagee because the mortgagor defaulted (usually the settlement date) Disposals not covered aboveDate you disposed of the property If more than 1 type of disposal applies, use the earliest date. Description of property If the land being sold/disposed of has a Certificate of Title number show this. If there is no Certificate of Title number, show 1 of the descriptions in the following table. Description of propertyInclude with your application a copy of: Leasehold titlethe lease Allocated number/letterthe plan or similar, for example subdivision or survey plan, showing the property and the part being disposed of with the allocated number/letter Other description, for example, a survey plan (not the address) similar documentation to the above that shows the property and the part being disposed of with the description 7 Notes to help you complete this form Share of property This is your share (as a percentage) of the property you are selling/disposing of. • In most cases this will be an equal share (100% / number of owners) of the property, for example 2 persons jointly owning the property will have a 50% share each. • If ownership is not equally divided then you will need to provide evidence to your withholder. • If you're selling/disposing of part of your share, state the amount of the total, for example, disposing of half of a half-share is 25% of the total. Associated persons There are a number of tests used to work out if 2 persons are associated for RLWT transactions. For example, you’re associated where you’re buying or selling: • to an individual and they are: - your spouse, civil union or de facto partner - within two degrees of blood relationship to you, your spouse, or civil union or de facto partner. • a company where: - you hold 25% or more of the voting rights or market value interest (the company and individual or entity other than a company test) - your spouse or children hold 25% of the voting rights or market value interest (the aggregation test) - where the combined holdings under all these rules total 25% or more market value interest. For example if you hold 10% of the shares in a company, your children hold 10%, and your family trust also holds 10%, then you are associated to the company. • a look-through company where: - you have a look-through interest in the company, and you are either a director or employee of the company - you have not or are not any of the above, but have a look-through interest of 25% or more. • a partnership that you are a partner of. • a limited partner in a limited partnership and have a 25% or more share in a right, obligation, property, status, or thing of the limited partnership. If you’re a trustee of a trust you’re associated when you’re selling to or buying from: • any settlor of the trust • a trustee of another trust where the trusts have a common settlor (spouses are treated as a separate person) • a person with power to appoint or remove trustees of the trust • a beneficiary of the trust • a beneficiary of the trust who is also related to you. Two companies are associated when conducting a property transaction between them where: • a group of persons total voting rights or market interest in each company are 50% or more • a group of persons control both companies by any other means. Aggregation rule There are additional rules that combine your interests with the interests held by people you're associated to making you associated to another person. The Tripartite test If you are associated to a person under 1 of the above rules, and that person is then associated to a third person you are selling to under a different rule, then you are associated to that third-person. The only exception is if the association is by the 2 companies test, and the association to the third-party comes from a test that does not involve an individual. For example you have control over 2 companies, Company A and Company B. These companies are associated to each other under the 2 companies test. Company A is the settlor of a trust where Peter is the beneficiary, so Peter is associated to Company A under the settlor and beneficiary test. As Peter is associated to Company A, and Company A is also associated to Company B, then Peter and Company B will also be associated. For more information about the association rules refer to our Tax and your property transactions - IR361 and A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes - IR620 guides, or talk to a tax professional.

A separate application is not needed from each partner. Question 8 - Certificate of Title number This will be on the Certificate of Title, and found on the Sale and Purchase agreement under “legal description - unique identifier or CT”. It may also be on your rates bill. Otherwise ask your lawyer/conveyancer. If there is no certificate of title show the reference number for the property, for example, leasehold title. Question 9 - Withholder This is the name of the person or entity who deducted the RLWT from your sale. You’ll need to confirm with the withholder the name you enter here is the same name the withholder used on the Residential land withholding tax - IR1100 return to pay the RLWT to us. This will help us process your repayment claim faster. Question 10A - Calculation You may be able to claim the difference between the RLWT deducted, and the RLWT calculated based on your estimated net profit on property-related income (shown on your attached schedule). For example, residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021 and sold with new build and non-new build on the same legal title, must have RLWT deducted from the full sale price if it is sold within 10 years. A refund claim can be made for the RLWT paid on the new build portion. Work out the maximum amount you can claim with the following calculation: RLWT deducted 1 Estimated net profit 2 Estimated net profit X RLWT rate (28% for a company or incorporated society, 39% for any other entity type) 3 Subtract box 3 from box 1. This is the maximum amount you can claim as an RLWT repayment 4 You do not have to claim this amount, it's just the maximum amount that can be claimed.

This determines the bright-line period end date. Question 10B - Date binding sale and purchase agreement entered into to buy the property For property sold before 1 July 2024, the date you acquired the property determines which main home exclusion criteria applies. For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). Full information on when a property is acquired is found in QB 17/02 on taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz A property acquired on or after 27 March 2021 will be treated as having been acquired before 27 March 2021, if the purchase was the result of an offer the purchaser made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer could not be withdrawn before 27 March 2021. To support this, please provide a copy of the sale and purchase agreement and any supporting contractual documents (including any tender document). Question 10B - Main home exclusion A main home is the property where you live for most of the time, or if you have more than 1 property it is the one that you have the greatest connection to. To be your main home you need to meet the main home exclusion criteria under the bright-line test. Property sold on or after 1 July 2024 You can claim the main home exclusion if you: • used more than 50% of the property’s area as your main home (including the yard, gardens, and garage) • u sed the property for more than 50% of the bright-line period as your main home. Property sold before 1 July 2024 Different criteria apply depending on when you acquired the property (generally the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into). 4 Use the following table to determine the main home exclusion criteria to use for property sold before 1 July 2024. Date property acquiredMain home exclusion criteria On or after 27 March 2021You must have: • used more than 50% of the property’s area as your main home (including the yard, gardens, and garage) • used the property for 100% of the time as your main home.

Question 10B – Repayment claims for main home If you acquired the property on or after 27 March 2021 and sold/disposed of it before 1 July 2024, you can apply for a repayment of RLWT if it is not eligible for the main home exclusion in full but you used: • less than half of the land as your main home.

Note: Both of these situations may apply. For more information about how to calculate the main home exclusion read our Bright-line property tax - IR1227 guide. Work out the amount you can claim with the following calculation: RLWT deducted 1 Reduced taxable income (net profit – (Main home days/total days owned x net profit)) 2 Reduced taxable income X RLWT rate (28% for a company or incorporated society, 39% for any other entity type) 3 Subtract box 3 from box 1.

Full information on when a property is acquired is found in QB 17/02 on taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz A property acquired on or after 27 March 2021 will be treated as having been acquired before 27 March 2021, if the purchase was the result of an offer the purchaser made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer could not be withdrawn before 27 March 2021. To support this, please provide a copy of the sale and purchase agreement and any supporting contractual documents (including any tender document).

Intermediary centre: You'll have access to all intermediary functions. Administrator You'll only have access to the intermediary's own accounts (that the owner gives you access to) and can access the intermediary's customer-level mail.

You can only manage client list security for lists you've been given access to. Restricted administrator You'll have the same access as administrators, but not access to the intermediary’s customer-level mail. Intermediary centre: You'll have the same access as an administrator.

Client list account permissions You can control who in your agency can access accounts linked to each client list.

Example We Sort Your Tax Limited has 2 client lists. List 1 is the general clients list, all staff have access to this. List 2 is a private list, it contains links to the director, their husband and family trust. The owner has set all their employees access to None for the private list to stop them from accessing and viewing the accounts. Note: In order to create additional client lists you need to contact IR. Once a new client list is created, you will need to set the staff access permissions. Staff access permissions You can also set the level of access someone has to each client list. When they access clients' accounts from the search tab, the access you set will be applied. Full account access You can do everything within an account, including updating a refund bank account and credit transfers within returns. FileYou can view everything, send mail, file returns and disclosures. If filing returns is not available for an account (for example, WFFTC), you'll only be able to view the account. You cannot request a credit transfer within a return or make any payments or refund bank account changes. Read onlyYou can send secure mail and view account balances, transactions, filed returns, account-specific notices and letters. NoneYou cannot do anything or access any clients, if your account permission is set to None for a list of clients.

If you have already added a key message contact, the logon will be ticked. To make changes select the Edit button. To edit each logon's client list permission, you can either: • select the access you would like to delegate • use the Reset to default access button. To select a key message contact the logon needs to have at least Read only access to the client list. Use the key message contact tick box to add or remove or change to another logon.

If you'd like client's refunds deposited into your bank account, you can set up a disbursement account to have client refunds redirected to. You need to talk to your account manager to have a 'disbursements' account set up. This works just like redirecting mail from client to tax agent. You must have your client's written permission to redirect their refunds as part of your authority to act. If you have this set up you will be given the option to 'Send refunds to:' Tax agent or client when you link. If the client is already linked to an intermediary of the same type, using this service will delink and replace them. Customer master link This new link type controls whether you are authorised to receive mail that is issued at the 'Customer level' rather than the 'Account (tax type) level'. Customer level mail includes instalment arrangement letters or summary of accounts where multiple accounts are combined. You may not be linked for all the account types that are covered in a Customer level letter, so make sure you check the wording of your authority to act. Only 1 tax agent can hold the 'Customer master' link for a customer. It will display whether an existing tax agent is already linked with the Customer master link. You do not need the Customer master link to set up instalment arrangements, but you do need it to change the clients Customer level address (across all accounts), to indicate a company or trust is inactive and to be able to see audit letters. Example ABC Accounts ltd is a large firm who specialise in large income tax accounts. They prepare the annual returns for John Smith. However, John Smith also uses a smaller firm XYZ Taxes ltd to complete payroll and GST. ABC Accounts ltd are linked for income tax and related accounts and have the customer master link. XYZ Taxes ltd are only linked for GST and PAY and related accounts. Note: Only select this link if your authority to act for this client allows you to act for all tax types.

Tax Agents Kaikaute Taake 1 IR1123 | October 2021 A guide on using the EOT dashboard in myIR. Tax agents see a different view in Manage agency to other intermediaries. This guide covers the tax agent's 'Manage agency' view. Agency EOT and overall agency results. The first tab is the Agency EOT showing your agency's overall performance. It includes data from all client lists, and any representative lists that you may have under a different IRD number, for example, individual partners. In the example image below your agency's overall performance as a percentage is 91.78%. We use this percentage to check your agency's performance against the performance measure in the Tax agents' extension of time (EOT) agreement - IR9XA. In the example your agency's list details shows two client lists. Three partners are also registered as tax agents under their own IRD numbers as agency representatives. (You view the list details by selecting the Breakdown button in the top right hand corner.) The Overall agency results panel shows the income tax period the results are for, and the extended return due date for that period. The results panel also shows you the total number of clients you're linked to for income tax. This figure includes clients who: • do not have a return expectation (ceased companies, 'auto issued - more info' requests) • have L EOT or D EOT that have been removed from the calculation below. Overall breakdown table The overall breakdown table shows standard, early and late balance dates with a total for them. The left hand column of the table has three parts showing tax returns required, those lodged, and a percentage of those lodged. Tax returns required This is the number of returns required, including 'auto issued - more info' requests. It excludes customers with L EOT and D EOT, unless their return has been lodged. We also break the figures down to show customers that have, and do not have, an EOT. Tax returns lodged This is the number of returns lodged and received by us, including 'auto issued - more info' requests. We also break these figures down to show those that have, and do not have, an EOT. Extension of time (EOT) dashboard ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. 2 Percentage of lodged tax returns This is a calculation that compares the above information. That's total returns with EOT we've received in comparison to the total returns with EOT that are required. Client list tables The Client lists table will show the results for each of your client lists. You can see the performance percentage of each list and select each client to see the breakdown. Any representative IRD numbers in the overall results show a combined performance percentage. For security reasons you cannot access representative client lists breakdowns from here. If you're authorised, log in under the web logon associated to the agency representative. You can then view the same dashboard and access the breakdown. Client list ID When you select the Client list ID link you can view the results breakdown for that client. This is a filtered view of the results for that list. It only shows the results that represent a component of the overall agency performance percentage. When you select the Client list ID link you can view the results breakdown.

Declaration To the best of my knowledge, the information given on this form is true and correct. Signature Date Please send this completed form to: Child Support, PO Box 39010, Wellington Mail Centre, Lower Hutt 5045 Child Support Page 5 ird.govt.nz/childsupport Privacy Meeting your child support obligations means giving us accurate information so we can assess your liabilities and entitlements under the Child Support Act 1991. We may also exchange information about you with: • some government agencies • another country, if we have an information supply agreement with them • Statistics New Zealand (for statistical purposes only). If you ask for the personal information we hold about you, we'll give it to you and correct any errors, unless we have a lawful reason not to. Call us on 0800 221 221 for more information. For full details of our privacy policy go to ird.govt.nz/privacy Notes to help you complete this form For the purposes of child support a child will either be a qualifying child or a dependent child – they cannot be both. Qualifying children These are the children that you are either paying or receiving child support for. To qualify for child support, a child must be: • under 18 years of age or 18 years of age and enrolled at and attending a registered school in New Zealand or an overseas school • a New Zealand citizen or ordinarily resident in New Zealand. The child cannot be: • receiving a benefit or student allowance, or working 30 hours or more a week (on average) • living with another person in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship. Dependent children A dependent child is: • a child that you are the parent of (see the note below - “who is a parent?”) • under 18 years of age or 18 years of age and enrolled at and attending a registered school in New Zealand or an overseas school • in your care, for example, living with you, or maintained as a member of your family but living somewhere else. For example, boarding school. A dependent child cannot be: • financially independent. That is, receiving a benefit or student allowance, or working 30 hours or more a week (on average) • living with another person in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship • a child in relation to whom any person is a liable parent or receiving carer, or for whom, under the law of another country, a person is required to make payments that are of the same nature as child support. Who is a parent? A parent is a person who: • is the birth or legally adoptive parent of a child • was married to the other parent when the child was conceived or born • has acknowledged before a court, or in writing, that they are a parent of the child and a court has not overturned this • has been declared a legal step-parent by the Family Court • a court has made a paternity order against in respect of the child. Proof of date of birth You will need to supply one of the following for proof of date of birth if you are telling us about a new dependent child: • full New Zealand birth certificate • overseas birth certificate • passport • certificate of New Zealand citizenship • certificate of identity • photo driver's licence • 18+ card issued by the Hospitality Association. Child Support Page 6 ird.govt.nz/childsupport Proof of parentage You will need to supply one of the following as proof you are the parent if you are telling us about a new dependent child: • the child's full New Zealand birth certificate • the child's full overseas birth certificate (with a certified English translation if necessary) • an adoption order for the child • a paternity order for the child made by a New Zealand or overseas court • a copy of the Family Court's declaration of step-parentage. IRD numbers for children If your child does not have an IRD number, you will need to apply for one. You can do this by completing an Application for an IRD number - individual - IR595 form. If your child does not have an IRD number, your request to have them added as dependent children cannot be accepted. Recognised care The child support formula takes the costs of raising a child and shares these costs between the parents based on their income and the amount of care each parent has for the child. Care of a child is recognised for child support: • for a parent when they care for the child at least 103 nights per year, or 2 nights per week (28% of the time) • for a non-parent carer, for example, a grandparent, when they care for a child for at least 128 nights per year, or 5 nights per fortnight (35% of the time). If a person provides more than 263 nights per year, or 5 nights a week on average (more than 72% of the time) of a child’s care, this is the only care we take into account in the child support formula calculation. Use our online calculator at ird.govt.nz/childsupport to work out your care levels. You can then print and attach it to this form. Agreement or court order If you have an agreement or court order detailing the care arrangements for your child/children, please send a copy with this form. We can use this to help work out your recognised care level. For more information about any of the above, please go to ird.govt.nz/childsupport

This guide is for people who administer the accounts for a Māori authority. Like all other taxpayers, Māori authorities have general tax requirements and are required to maintain records about their business and non-business activities for seven years. There are also some special tax rules that apply to Māori authorities. These relate to: •record keeping in a special account called the Māori authority credit account (MACA) •attaching credits to distributions. These are covered in more detail in this guide. If you have elected to be a Māori authority, you must follow these rules. You can opt out at any time but must let us know. For more information see Becoming a Māori authority (IR487). The Māori authority credit system Like all other taxpayers, Māori authorities are required to maintain records about their business and non-business activities for 7 years. You can find out more about record keeping and tax requirements at www.ird.govt.nz (keywords: accounting for tax) or download our Smart business (IR320) guide. What is a Māori authority credit? Māori authorities can choose to attach credits to the distributions they pay out to their members for the income tax already paid by the authority, so profits aren't taxed twice. The amount attached is called a Māori authority credit. How the credit system works The credit system applies to all income tax. The following example shows how it works. Example Tax on Māori authority Māori authority profit$1,000 Tax at 17.5%$ 175 After-tax profit$ 825 Distribution paid to members$ 825 Retained earningsNil Tax on member Distribution received$ 825 Māori authority credit$ 175 Taxable amount$1,000 Tax at (say) 17.5%$ 175 Less Māori authority credit$ 175 Tax payable by memberNil Result for member Cash distribution received$ 825 Less tax payableNil Net distribution after tax$ 825 4 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Record keeping in the Māori authority credit account (MACA) The MACA records: •how much income tax a Māori authority has paid on its income •Māori authority tax credits available for allocation with distributions. It has: •an opening balance •credit and debit entries •a closing balance. Who must keep a MACA? All Māori authorities must set up a MACA except: •those whose rules don't allow it to distribute its income or property to members, or •those that only derive exempt income, not including certain dividends, within a wholly owned group. Period covered by the MACA A MACA covers the period from 1 April in one year to 31 March in the following year, regardless of an authority's balance date. This period is called the MACA year or imputation year. An authority with a balance date other than 31 March can't line up its MACA year with its accounting year. You have to maintain these records for 7 years. Transactions recorded in the MACA Opening balance The opening balance of the MACA (which may be either a debit or credit) is the same as the closing balance of the preceding MACA year. When a Māori authority enters the Māori authority rules they will have a nil opening balance. They will need to record credit and debit entries in the MACA. Credit entries These entries increase the credits available for distribution to members. They are recorded in dollar amounts. 1. New Zealand income tax paid during the tax year to meet a provisional tax obligation or to satisfy an income tax liability. There are exceptions for income tax paid in the following circumstances: –any income tax that would have been payable had the MACA year ended on the day immediately before the day the Māori authority became a Māori authority –income tax paid by using credits the Māori authority already holds in its MACA that it has received from income from another Māori authority –a payment of "further income tax" credited against any income tax or provisional tax that happens after the payment of the further income tax –an allocation of any overpayment of provisional tax by a Māori authority. 2. Further income tax the Māori authority paid to reduce the previous year's closing debit balance. For more information, see page 5. 3. Māori authority credits attached to distributions received from other Māori authorities. 4. Imputation credits attached to a dividend that is paid to the Māori authority. 5. FDP (foreign dividend payment) credits attached to dividends received by Māori authorities that don't have an FDP account. 6. An adjustment, which has subsequently been overturned, to offset a previous debit that has arisen from a determination that the credits are subject to an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage. 7. RWT deducted from income that the Māori authority receives. In most cases, credit entries occur in the MACA on the date the transaction that caused them takes place - the date of payment. This happens regardless of the period it relates to. 5 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Debit entries These entries reduce the amount of credit available for distribution to members. Like credits, they're also recorded in dollar amounts. 1. Māori authority credits attached to the distributions paid by the Māori authority to its members. 2. The amount of any overpaid provisional tax allocated by the Māori authority to satisfy any provisional tax of another wholly owned Māori authority. 3. Income tax refunds received during the income year except where the refund: –is for income tax related to an income year where the Māori authority didn't maintain a MACA –relates to a part of a year in which the Māori authority didn't operate a MACA. 4. An "allocation debit" entry when the Māori authority credit ratio of any subsequent Māori authority taxable distribution differs from that of the "benchmark" distribution and a "ratio change declaration" hasn't been made. For more information, see below. 5. Refund of FDP paid to the Māori authority where the Māori authority isn't a "foreign dividend account" company. 6. Adjustments when a change of shareholding of more than 34% has taken place. For more information see page 6. 7. Any overpaid income tax applied by Inland Revenue for tax liabilities other than income tax or provisional tax instalments. 8. An apportionment of income tax for the number of days the organisation was a recognised Māori authority. 9. An amount equal to the credit balance immediately before a Māori authority ceases to be a Māori authority. 10. Adjustments made when we consider an arrangement has been made to obtain a tax advantage. 11. Adjustments made to eliminate any unused credit balance affected by the loss of continuity if membership of the authority. In most cases, a debit entry appears in the MACA on the date of the transaction. Closing balance This is the result of taking the opening balance and adding the credit entries then deducting the debit entries. If the closing balance is a credit, the Māori authority has tax credits that it can use next year such as attaching the credit to a distribution. If the closing balance is a debit, the authority has allocated more tax than it has paid. A payment of further income tax is required to be made by 20 June to clear the debit balance. A 10% Māori authority distribution penalty tax is also payable. Benchmark distribution A distribution is a transfer of value (such as a payment of interest, principal or dividend) from the Māori authority to its members. The first taxable Māori authority distribution made by a Māori authority in any tax year is called the benchmark distribution. This sets the ratio between the credits and dividends for the rest of the tax year. If there are changes to the benchmark ratio of subsequent dividends, the Ratio change declaration (IR407) form must be completed. See 'Ratio change declaration' below. For examples of different types of distributions, see page 9. Māori authority credit ratio This credit ratio is calculated using the following formula: Māori authority credit net distribution where: Māori authority credit is the amount of the Māori authority credit attached to the distribution and, if a Māori authority credit isn't attached, that amount is zero. Net distribution is the amount of the distribution by the Māori authority, not including any Māori authority credit. The ratio of Māori authority credits attached to the benchmark distribution will generally determine the ratio that all other distributions in that MACA year must take. If a Māori authority tries to distribute Māori authority credits at a higher ratio to the one set by its benchmark distribution, it will have to pay an "allocation debit" penalty, unless it declares the ratio change. Ratio change declaration To declare the change, complete a Ratio change declaration (IR407) form. Note If a MACA goes into debit throughout the year it must pay any debit balance that exists at 31 March on or before the following 20 June. 6 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Attaching Māori authority credits to distributions A Māori authority may choose whether to attach credits to the distributions it pays to its members. However, if it chooses to do so it must follow certain rules. Māori authority tax rate and maximum ratio The Māori authority tax rate is 17.5%. Māori authorities are free to decide whether to attach a Māori authority credit to distributions they pay, but there is a maximum ratio of credit to distributions that can be allocated. If this ratio is exceeded, the Māori authority would effectively be passing on more credits to its members than tax it has paid on the profits from which those distributions were paid. Example Māori authority profit $ 100.00 Tax @ 17.5% $ 17.50 Tax paid profit $ 82.50 The Māori authority has paid $17.50 of tax on the $82.50 available for distribution. The base ratio is therefore 21.21 cents in the dollar ($17.50 ÷ $82.50). Resident withholding tax (RWT) RWT is a tax deducted from investment income, like Māori authority dividends, before the investor, or beneficiary, receives it. The amount of RWT to pay is: •17.5% if a the member's IRD number is recorded •33% if the member's IRD number is not recorded. Māori authority doesn't have the member's IRD number and the distribution exceeds $200, in which case the tax rate is 33%, reduced by any Māori authority credits attached, up to a maximum rate of 17.5%. This amount is reduced by any Māori authority credits attached, up to a maximum rate of 17.5%. This means that people who receive Māori authority dividends don't have to pay all the tax in a lump sum at the end of the year. People who don't declare their dividends still have tax deducted from it. In these circumstances, we still follow up on undeclared income, and take action against people who don't declare it. Taxable Māori authority distributions are also subject to RWT if the: •Māori authority decides not to attach any credits to the distribution •credits attached are less than 17.5% of the gross distribution. Example Mere is a member in a Māori authority and has provided an IRD number. The Māori authority makes a distribution to Mere of $90, which is made up of $80 in cash and $10 in Māori authority credits. The Māori authority must withhold a further $5.75 in tax so that Mere only receives $74.25 in cash. Net distribution $ 74.25 Māori authority credits $ 10.00 RWT $ 5.75 $ 15.75 Gross distribution $ 90.00 The total tax paid by way of credits and RWT is $15.75, which is 17.5% of the gross distribution of $90. Companies must hold 66% membership to pass on credits Where a Māori authority is a company, credits can only be passed on to members of a Māori authority if at least 66% of those members remain with the authority from the time the credits arise, to the date they're distributed to the members. If the membership of a Māori authority changes by more than 34%, the Māori authority has lost membership continuity. This rule is set in place to prevent members who didn't hold their shares at the time the Māori authority credit arose, being able to use the Māori authority credits they receive as part of any future distribution. In this situation, a Māori authority must enter a debit entry into the Māori authority credit account (MACA). 7 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Special transitional rules Māori authority credits are often distributed in a different tax year from when the relevant tax was paid. So, there are some special rules to cover the change in the tax rate during the transitional period. These apply from the start of a Māori authority's 2011-12 income year until 31 March 2013. Ratio of tax credits to distributions The tax rate determines the maximum ratio of Māori authority credits your Māori authority can attach to distributions it makes. From the start of the 2011-12 income year, the ratio is 17.5:82.5, ie, you can attach $17.50 of credits to each $82.50 of distributions made. Applying this maximum is straightforward when attaching credits that relate to tax paid at the current tax rate of 17.5%. However, making this change immediately to all distributions could risk disadvantaging members, if the authority still has credits in its credit account or FDP account that relate to tax paid at 19.5%. During the transitional period, a Māori authority can choose to continue attaching credits that relate to 19.5% tax at up to the previous maximum ratio of 19.5:80.5 if: •the MACA has a credit balance at the start of its 2011-12 income year and the 19.5% tax rate was used, or •it pays any income tax at the previous 19.5% rate after that date, or •it receives tax credits (eg, as a member of another Māori authority) after that date, that were imputed at over 17.5:82.5. After 31 March 2013, the maximum ratio of 17.5:82.5 will be charged for all distributions, regardless of which tax rate the tax credit relates to. Example 1 The Māori authority has credits to allocate during the transitional period: Taxable income (2010-11 return) $ 10,000 Māori authority credit for tax paid at 19.5% $ 1,950 On 1 September 2011, the authority allocates credits for a distribution payment to its members. Distribution payment 1 September 2011 $ 80.50 Credits attached for tax paid at 19.5% $ 19.50 Total distributions $ 100 Even though the 17.5% tax rate now applies for income tax currently payable, the maximum Māori authority credit ratio remains 19.5:80.5 for this allocation because these credits relate to tax paid at the 19.5% rate. After this distribution, the authority still has $1,930.50 of credits remaining in its MACA that it can attach at the 19.5:80.5 any time up to 31 March 2013. Example 2 A Māori authority began trading during 2010 and has earned a sum of Māori authority credits for tax it paid at 19.5%. Taxable income (2010-11 return) $ 1,000 Māori authority credit for tax paid at 19.5% $ 195 On 26 March 2012, in the last week of the 2011-12 tax year, the authority makes its first distributions to members. Distributions made $ 805 Credits imputed at 19.5:80.5 (maximum) $ 195 Total distribution $ 1,000 The debit for this distribution matches the full amount of Māori authority credits in its MACA that relate to tax paid at 19.5%. If the authority later makes a further distribution, attaching Māori authority credits for tax it paid in the 2011-12 income year (at 17.5%) because it's already allocated all 19.5%-related credits in its MACA, the 17.5:82.5 maximum applies. If it gains no more 19.5%-related credits, the new maximum applies for all its future distributions. 8 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Recording credits and debits in memorandum accounts If your Māori authority chooses to continue imputing credits at over 17.5:82.5 (up to 19.5:80.5), it needs to track which credit and debit entries in its MACA relate to the 19.5% tax rate. This rule also applies to group MACA records and FDP accounts. This tracking ensures your Māori authority: •doesn't over-allocate the credits, and •provides correct data in its Māori authority/FDP return. However, each Māori authority must maintain only a single memorandum account and file a single return. Variation from benchmark distribution ratio If the Māori authority tax rate change is the sole reason for a Māori authority credit ratio of credits attached to any subsequent distribution from that set by the first benchmark distribution, you don't need to file a Ratio change declaration (IR407). Example 3 In Example 2 on page 28, the first distribution payment set the benchmark distribution ratio for the 2011-12 tax year at 19.5:80.5. The second payment's ratio was 17.5:82.5, but this variation was only due to the tax rate change, so the authority doesn't have to declare the ratio change before issuing the distribution. Variation from previous year's ratio When submitting your Māori authority's annual return, we require an explanation if the authority's ratio for the year overall varies more than 20% from the ratio in your previous year's return. In determining whether you need to give an explanation, you can ignore any portion of the variation that exists because of the change in tax rate. Example 4 Your overall ratio this year varies 22% from last year's. • You don't need to explain if it's made up of: - 3% due to the tax rate change, and - 19% due to other factors. • You do need to explain if it's made up of: - 1% due to the tax rate change, and - 21% due to other factors. Ignoring the tax rate impact, the variation is still over 20%. Last day for using transitional ratio A Māori authority can make distributions imputed at more than 17.5:82.5 up till 31 March 2013. After this date, they must use the maximum Māori authority ratio of 17.5:82.5 for all distributions, regardless of the tax rate the tax credits relate to. 9 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Making distributions to Māori authority members Types of distributions Distribution typeExample The amount paid or credited by the Māori authority to a member in any manner or under any name. A taxable bonus issue made by the Māori authority. An amount applied by the Māori authority exclusively for the member. A Māori authority may pay a member's electricity bill. Although this amount isn't paid or credited to the member, it's treated as a distribution as it's applied for the benefit of that member. An amount advanced by the Māori authority to a member to the extent that the advancement isn't a genuine investment by the Māori authority. A Māori authority may extend an, interest-free loan to a member. As they would have received interest if they had invested that money in a bank, the interest forgone by the Māori authority is treated as a distribution to the member who received it. Property disposed of by the Māori authority to a member without payment in cash or kind or where the payment is less than the market value of the property. A Māori authority owns a hectare of land with a market value of $30,000. If the Māori authority sells that land to a member for $20,000, the $10,000 difference between the market value and the actual price paid will be treated as a distribution to the member. Property disposed of by a member to the Māori authority for more than the market value of the property. A Māori authority member owns a hectare of land with a market value of $30,000 that the Māori authority wishes to use for its own purposes. If the Māori authority were to pay $40,000 for the land, the $10,000 that the member receives over and above the market value of the land will be treated as a distribution. Taxable and non-taxable distributions Māori authorities must ensure that in distributing this income to members, members receive proportionate shares of both taxable and non-taxable incomes. Taxable distributions include as their source: •gross income of the Māori authority •that gross income not exempt from tax. Non-taxable distributions include as their source: •exempt income •tax paid income received under other tax type rules. Example A Māori authority of two members wishes to distribute $2,000. Of the $2,000, $1,000 is a taxable Māori authority distribution, and the other $1,000 isn't. The Māori authority can't "stream"\* the taxable Māori authority distribution to the member who has most use for any Māori authority credits that may be attached. Instead, the Māori authority must distribute a $500 taxable Māori authority distribution and a $500 other distribution to each of the two members. \* "Stream" means to be selective about who gets allocated income or tax credits based on the best tax result. In the example the authority can't allocate the non-taxable distribution to a member on say 33% marginal tax rate and allocate the $1,000 taxable distribution to a member on 10.5% marginal tax rate. 10 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Filing end-of-year returns What you must provide to us At the end of each year all Māori authorities must complete and return the following returns to help us determine the right amount of tax has been paid. •Income tax return: Māori authorities (IR8), unless they have an exemption . This return provides a complete statement of the authority's taxable income •Annual Māori authority credit account return (IR8J) •Māori authority distribution statement. What to include on the IR8J All Māori authorities maintaining a MACA must complete an end-of-year Annual Māori authority credit account return (IR8J). You must show the following information in this return: •opening balance •amount and source of all debits •amount and source of all credits •closing balance. A Māori authority must file its IR8 return by the due date for filing its income tax return for the corresponding income year. Limits on income tax refund Income tax refunds will generally be limited to the amount of the credit closing balance at the most recently ended MACA year. For example, a refund of income tax being issued 31 May 2011 will be limited to the credit balance in the MACA as at 31 March 2011. This is because some of the credits that were in the MACA have already been attached to distributions paid to members. The balance of the income tax credit that hasn't been refunded will be automatically transferred to the following financial year as a provisional tax payment. If the MACA closing balance is nil or a debit, the Māori authority won't be entitled to receive any income tax refund. Māori authority distribution statement A Māori authority that makes a distribution to a member must, at the time it makes the distribution, complete and retain a distribution statement. The distribution statement must include: •the name of the Māori authority •the name, address, and IRD number of the member who is receiving the distribution •the date the distribution is made •the total amount of distribution made •the amount of the distribution made to the member, including what portion is a taxable distribution and what portion is a non- taxable distribution •the total amount of Māori authority credits attached to the distribution or treated as being attached to the distribution (shown as a nil amount if Māori authority credits are not attached) •any more information the Commissioner may require. All Māori authorities maintaining a MACA must complete a statement advising us of the total amount of distributions of credits made to their members. If no distributions have been made, a nil statement must be completed. File this with the Income tax return: Māori authorities (IR8). Members' distribution statement All Māori authorities maintaining a MACA and making distribution to their members must provide them with a distribution statement. This tells them about distributions they receive so they can, if necessary, complete their personal tax returns. 11 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Paying further income tax If the MACA has a debit balance at 31 March the authority must make a payment, "further income tax", to clear the debit balance. The authority gets a benefit from the further income tax payment. It can be used to meet any income tax liability that they become liable for after the payment is made. Penalties that may apply Overdue further income tax If a Māori authority has a debit balance in its MACA at 31 March it will automatically incur a 10% penalty on the further income tax due - a Māori authority distribution penalty tax. This is to encourage Māori authorities to have a credit closing balance. Both further income tax and Māori authority distribution penalty tax are due by 20 June following the end of the MACA year. Late payment penalty An extra 1% late payment penalty is charged on any balance over $100 which is outstanding after 20 June, plus 4% of the amount of tax to pay at the end of the 7th day after the due date. A further 1% incremental penalty is charged on any amount outstanding (including penalties) after each further month until the amount is paid in full. Note If a Māori authority stops being a Māori authority and a debit balance exists, the authority must clear that debit no later than the last day on which the organisation is still a Māori authority. If this amount isn't paid by the due date, late payment penalties may apply. For more information about penalties and interest, go to our guides Taxpayer obligations, interest and penalties (IR240) and Late payment and late filing penalties (IR741). If you receive income from a Māori authority It's important members receiving distributions from Māori authorities understand their own personal income tax responsibilities. Distributions from Māori authorities now have credits attached to them. Credits received that exceed the Māori authority member's tax liability may be refunded to the Māori authority member. However, we are entitled to use the Māori authority credits to meet any other tax payments payable by the member, for example, any tax arrears. A refund will be made where there's still a credit after all tax liabilities have been met. Distribution statements A member should also receive a distribution statement from a Māori authority. If you're a member, this information will assist you when completing your personal income tax return or when requesting a personal tax summary. IRD numbers If you're a member receiving taxable distributions from a Māori authority, make sure you give your IRD number to the Māori authority. The authority can then apply the current tax rate of 17.5% to the distribution, instead of the 33% no-notification rate that will apply if you don't supply an IRD number. RWT paid Any RWT paid on taxable Māori authority distributions should be included with total RWT paid on interest. However, it is essential to attach a note to the return to explain the source of RWT and why there was no accompanying interest income as this makes return processing more efficient. Note Māori authority members whose total income exceeds $48,000 will have to request a personal tax summary or file an income tax return if they also receive taxable Māori authority distributions of more than $200. 12 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Services you may need myIR A myIR account lets you manage all your Inland Revenue matters securely online.

This guide is for people who administer the accounts for a Māori authority. Like all other taxpayers, Māori authorities have general tax requirements and are required to maintain records about their business and non-business activities for seven years. There are also some special tax rules that apply to Māori authorities. These relate to: •record keeping in a special account called the Māori authority credit account (MACA) •attaching credits to distributions. These are covered in more detail in this guide. If you have elected to be a Māori authority, you must follow these rules. You can opt out at any time but must let us know. For more information see Becoming a Māori authority - IR487. The Māori authority credit system Like all other taxpayers, Māori authorities are required to maintain records about their business and non-business activities for 7 years. You can find out more about record keeping and tax requirements at ird.govt.nz/records or download our Smart business - IR320 guide. What is a Māori authority credit? Māori authorities can choose to attach credits to the distributions they pay out to their members for the income tax already paid by the authority, so profits aren't taxed twice. The amount attached is called a Māori authority credit. How the credit system works The credit system applies to all income tax. The following example shows how it works. Example Tax on Māori authority Māori authority profit$1,000 Tax at 17.5%$ 175 After-tax profit$ 825 Distribution paid to members$ 825 Retained earningsNil Tax on member Distribution received$ 825 Māori authority credit$ 175 Taxable amount$1,000 Tax at (say) 17.5%$ 175 Less Māori authority credit$ 175 Tax payable by memberNil Result for member Cash distribution received$ 825 Less tax payableNil Net distribution after tax$ 825 4 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Record keeping in the Māori authority credit account (MACA) The MACA records: •how much income tax a Māori authority has paid on its income •Māori authority tax credits available for allocation with distributions. It has: •an opening balance •credit and debit entries •a closing balance. Who must keep a MACA? All Māori authorities must set up a MACA except: •those whose rules don't allow it to distribute its income or property to members, or •those that only derive exempt income, not including certain dividends, within a wholly owned group. Period covered by the MACA A MACA covers the period from 1 April in one year to 31 March in the following year, regardless of an authority's balance date. This period is called the MACA year or imputation year. An authority with a balance date other than 31 March can't line up its MACA year with its accounting year. You have to maintain these records for 7 years. Transactions recorded in the MACA Opening balance The opening balance of the MACA (which may be either a debit or credit) is the same as the closing balance of the preceding MACA year. When a Māori authority enters the Māori authority rules they will have a nil opening balance. They will need to record credit and debit entries in the MACA. Credit entries These entries increase the credits available for distribution to members. They are recorded in dollar amounts. 1. New Zealand income tax paid during the tax year to meet a provisional tax obligation or to satisfy an income tax liability. There are exceptions for income tax paid in the following circumstances: –any income tax that would have been payable had the MACA year ended on the day immediately before the day the Māori authority became a Māori authority –income tax paid by using credits the Māori authority already holds in its MACA that it has received from income from another Māori authority –a payment of "further income tax" credited against any income tax or provisional tax that happens after the payment of the further income tax –an allocation of any overpayment of provisional tax by a Māori authority. 2. Further income tax the Māori authority paid to reduce the previous year's closing debit balance. For more information, see page 5. 3. Māori authority credits attached to distributions received from other Māori authorities. 4. Imputation credits attached to a dividend that is paid to the Māori authority. 5. FDP (foreign dividend payment) credits attached to dividends received by Māori authorities that don't have an FDP account. 6. An adjustment, which has subsequently been overturned, to offset a previous debit that has arisen from a determination that the credits are subject to an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage. 7. RWT deducted from income that the Māori authority receives. In most cases, credit entries occur in the MACA on the date the transaction that caused them takes place - the date of payment. This happens regardless of the period it relates to. 5 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Debit entries These entries reduce the amount of credit available for distribution to members. Like credits, they're also recorded in dollar amounts. 1. Māori authority credits attached to the distributions paid by the Māori authority to its members. 2. The amount of any overpaid provisional tax allocated by the Māori authority to satisfy any provisional tax of another wholly owned Māori authority. 3. Income tax refunds received during the income year except where the refund: –is for income tax related to an income year where the Māori authority didn't maintain a MACA –relates to a part of a year in which the Māori authority didn't operate a MACA. 4. An "allocation debit" entry when the Māori authority credit ratio of any subsequent Māori authority taxable distribution differs from that of the "benchmark" distribution and a "ratio change declaration" hasn't been made. For more information, see below. 5. Refund of FDP paid to the Māori authority where the Māori authority isn't a "foreign dividend account" company. 6. Adjustments when a change of shareholding of more than 34% has taken place. For more information see page 6. 7. Any overpaid income tax applied by Inland Revenue for tax liabilities other than income tax or provisional tax instalments. 8. An apportionment of income tax for the number of days the organisation was a recognised Māori authority. 9. An amount equal to the credit balance immediately before a Māori authority ceases to be a Māori authority. 10. Adjustments made when we consider an arrangement has been made to obtain a tax advantage. 11. Adjustments made to eliminate any unused credit balance affected by the loss of continuity if membership of the authority. In most cases, a debit entry appears in the MACA on the date of the transaction. Closing balance This is the result of taking the opening balance and adding the credit entries then deducting the debit entries. If the closing balance is a credit, the Māori authority has tax credits that it can use next year such as attaching the credit to a distribution. If the closing balance is a debit, the authority has allocated more tax than it has paid. A payment of further income tax is required to be made by 20 June to clear the debit balance. A 10% Māori authority distribution penalty tax is also payable. Benchmark distribution A distribution is a transfer of value (such as a payment of interest, principal or dividend) from the Māori authority to its members. The first taxable Māori authority distribution made by a Māori authority in any tax year is called the benchmark distribution. This sets the ratio between the credits and dividends for the rest of the tax year. If there are changes to the benchmark ratio of subsequent dividends, the Ratio change declaration - IR407 form must be completed. See 'Ratio change declaration' below. For examples of different types of distributions, see page 9. Māori authority credit ratio This credit ratio is calculated using the following formula: Māori authority credit net distribution where: Māori authority credit is the amount of the Māori authority credit attached to the distribution and, if a Māori authority credit isn't attached, that amount is zero. Net distribution is the amount of the distribution by the Māori authority, not including any Māori authority credit. The ratio of Māori authority credits attached to the benchmark distribution will generally determine the ratio that all other distributions in that MACA year must take. If a Māori authority tries to distribute Māori authority credits at a higher ratio to the one set by its benchmark distribution, it will have to pay an "allocation debit" penalty, unless it declares the ratio change. Ratio change declaration To declare the change, complete a Ratio change declaration - IR407 form. Note If a MACA goes into debit throughout the year it must pay any debit balance that exists at 31 March on or before the following 20 June. 6 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Attaching Māori authority credits to distributions A Māori authority may choose whether to attach credits to the distributions it pays to its members. However, if it chooses to do so it must follow certain rules. Māori authority tax rate and maximum ratio The Māori authority tax rate is 17.5%. Māori authorities are free to decide whether to attach a Māori authority credit to distributions they pay, but there is a maximum ratio of credit to distributions that can be allocated. If this ratio is exceeded, the Māori authority would effectively be passing on more credits to its members than tax it has paid on the profits from which those distributions were paid. Example Māori authority profit $ 100.00 Tax @ 17.5% $ 17.50 Tax paid profit $ 82.50 The Māori authority has paid $17.50 of tax on the $82.50 available for distribution. The base ratio is therefore 21.21 cents in the dollar ($17.50 ÷ $82.50). Resident withholding tax (RWT) RWT is a tax deducted from investment income, like Māori authority dividends, before the investor, or beneficiary, receives it. The amount of RWT to pay is: •17.5% if a the member's IRD number is recorded •33% if the member’s IRD number is not recorded. Māori authority doesn't have the member's IRD number and the distribution exceeds $200, in which case the tax rate is 33%, reduced by any Māori authority credits attached, up to a maximum rate of 17.5%. This amount is reduced by any Māori authority credits attached, up to a maximum rate of 17.5%. This means that people who receive Māori authority dividends don't have to pay all the tax in a lump sum at the end of the year. People who don't declare their dividends still have tax deducted from it. In these circumstances, we still follow up on undeclared income, and take action against people who don't declare it. Taxable Māori authority distributions are also subject to RWT if the: •Māori authority decides not to attach any credits to the distribution •credits attached are less than 17.5% of the gross distribution. Example Mere is a member in a Māori authority and has provided an IRD number. The Māori authority makes a distribution to Mere of $90, which is made up of $80 in cash and $10 in Māori authority credits. The Māori authority must withhold a further $5.75 in tax so that Mere only receives $74.25 in cash. Net distribution $ 74.25 Māori authority credits $ 10.00 RWT $ 5.75 $ 15.75 Gross distribution $ 90.00 The total tax paid by way of credits and RWT is $15.75, which is 17.5% of the gross distribution of $90. Companies must hold 66% membership to pass on credits Where a Māori authority is a company, credits can only be passed on to members of a Māori authority if at least 66% of those members remain with the authority from the time the credits arise, to the date they're distributed to the members. If the membership of a Māori authority changes by more than 34%, the Māori authority has lost membership continuity. This rule is set in place to prevent members who didn't hold their shares at the time the Māori authority credit arose, being able to use the Māori authority credits they receive as part of any future distribution. In this situation, a Māori authority must enter a debit entry into the Māori authority credit account (MACA). 7 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Special transitional rules Māori authority credits are often distributed in a different tax year from when the relevant tax was paid. So, there are some special rules to cover the change in the tax rate during the transitional period. These apply from the start of a Māori authority's 2011-12 income year until 31 March 2013. Ratio of tax credits to distributions The tax rate determines the maximum ratio of Māori authority credits your Māori authority can attach to distributions it makes. From the start of the 2011-12 income year, the ratio is 17.5:82.5, ie, you can attach $17.50 of credits to each $82.50 of distributions made. Applying this maximum is straightforward when attaching credits that relate to tax paid at the current tax rate of 17.5%. However, making this change immediately to all distributions could risk disadvantaging members, if the authority still has credits in its credit account or FDP account that relate to tax paid at 19.5%. During the transitional period, a Māori authority can choose to continue attaching credits that relate to 19.5% tax at up to the previous maximum ratio of 19.5:80.5 if: •the MACA has a credit balance at the start of its 2011-12 income year and the 19.5% tax rate was used, or •it pays any income tax at the previous 19.5% rate after that date, or •it receives tax credits (eg, as a member of another Māori authority) after that date, that were imputed at over 17.5:82.5. After 31 March 2013, the maximum ratio of 17.5:82.5 will be charged for all distributions, regardless of which tax rate the tax credit relates to. Example 1 The Māori authority has credits to allocate during the transitional period: Taxable income (2010-11 return) $ 10,000 Māori authority credit for tax paid at 19.5% $ 1,950 On 1 September 2011, the authority allocates credits for a distribution payment to its members. Distribution payment 1 September 2011 $ 80.50 Credits attached for tax paid at 19.5% $ 19.50 Total distributions $ 100 Even though the 17.5% tax rate now applies for income tax currently payable, the maximum Māori authority credit ratio remains 19.5:80.5 for this allocation because these credits relate to tax paid at the 19.5% rate. After this distribution, the authority still has $1,930.50 of credits remaining in its MACA that it can attach at the 19.5:80.5 any time up to 31 March 2013. Example 2 A Māori authority began trading during 2010 and has earned a sum of Māori authority credits for tax it paid at 19.5%. Taxable income (2010-11 return) $ 1,000 Māori authority credit for tax paid at 19.5% $ 195 On 26 March 2012, in the last week of the 2011-12 tax year, the authority makes its first distributions to members. Distributions made $ 805 Credits imputed at 19.5:80.5 (maximum) $ 195 Total distribution $ 1,000 The debit for this distribution matches the full amount of Māori authority credits in its MACA that relate to tax paid at 19.5%. If the authority later makes a further distribution, attaching Māori authority credits for tax it paid in the 2011-12 income year (at 17.5%) because it's already allocated all 19.5%-related credits in its MACA, the 17.5:82.5 maximum applies. If it gains no more 19.5%-related credits, the new maximum applies for all its future distributions. 8 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Recording credits and debits in memorandum accounts If your Māori authority chooses to continue imputing credits at over 17.5:82.5 (up to 19.5:80.5), it needs to track which credit and debit entries in its MACA relate to the 19.5% tax rate. This rule also applies to group MACA records and FDP accounts. This tracking ensures your Māori authority: •doesn't over-allocate the credits, and •provides correct data in its Māori authority/FDP return. However, each Māori authority must maintain only a single memorandum account and file a single return. Variation from benchmark distribution ratio If the Māori authority tax rate change is the sole reason for a Māori authority credit ratio of credits attached to any subsequent distribution from that set by the first benchmark distribution, you don’t need to file a Ratio change declaration - IR407. Example 3 In Example 2 on page 28, the first distribution payment set the benchmark distribution ratio for the 2011-12 tax year at 19.5:80.5. The second payment's ratio was 17.5:82.5, but this variation was only due to the tax rate change, so the authority doesn't have to declare the ratio change before issuing the distribution. Variation from previous year's ratio When submitting your Māori authority's annual return, we require an explanation if the authority's ratio for the year overall varies more than 20% from the ratio in your previous year's return. In determining whether you need to give an explanation, you can ignore any portion of the variation that exists because of the change in tax rate. Example 4 Your overall ratio this year varies 22% from last year's. • You don't need to explain if it's made up of: - 3% due to the tax rate change, and - 19% due to other factors. • You do need to explain if it's made up of: - 1% due to the tax rate change, and - 21% due to other factors. Ignoring the tax rate impact, the variation is still over 20%. Last day for using transitional ratio A Māori authority can make distributions imputed at more than 17.5:82.5 up till 31 March 2013. After this date, they must use the maximum Māori authority ratio of 17.5:82.5 for all distributions, regardless of the tax rate the tax credits relate to. 9 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Making distributions to Māori authority members Types of distributions Distribution typeExample The amount paid or credited by the Māori authority to a member in any manner or under any name. A taxable bonus issue made by the Māori authority. An amount applied by the Māori authority exclusively for the member. A Māori authority may pay a member's electricity bill. Although this amount isn't paid or credited to the member, it's treated as a distribution as it's applied for the benefit of that member. An amount advanced by the Māori authority to a member to the extent that the advancement isn't a genuine investment by the Māori authority. A Māori authority may extend an, interest-free loan to a member. As they would have received interest if they had invested that money in a bank, the interest forgone by the Māori authority is treated as a distribution to the member who received it. Property disposed of by the Māori authority to a member without payment in cash or kind or where the payment is less than the market value of the property. A Māori authority owns a hectare of land with a market value of $30,000. If the Māori authority sells that land to a member for $20,000, the $10,000 difference between the market value and the actual price paid will be treated as a distribution to the member. Property disposed of by a member to the Māori authority for more than the market value of the property. A Māori authority member owns a hectare of land with a market value of $30,000 that the Māori authority wishes to use for its own purposes. If the Māori authority were to pay $40,000 for the land, the $10,000 that the member receives over and above the market value of the land will be treated as a distribution. Taxable and non-taxable distributions Māori authorities must ensure that in distributing this income to members, members receive proportionate shares of both taxable and non-taxable incomes. Taxable distributions include as their source: •gross income of the Māori authority •that gross income not exempt from tax. Non-taxable distributions include as their source: •exempt income •tax paid income received under other tax type rules. Example A Māori authority of two members wishes to distribute $2,000. Of the $2,000, $1,000 is a taxable Māori authority distribution, and the other $1,000 isn't. The Māori authority can't "stream"\* the taxable Māori authority distribution to the member who has most use for any Māori authority credits that may be attached. Instead, the Māori authority must distribute a $500 taxable Māori authority distribution and a $500 other distribution to each of the two members. \* "Stream" means to be selective about who gets allocated income or tax credits based on the best tax result. In the example the authority can't allocate the non-taxable distribution to a member on say 33% marginal tax rate and allocate the $1,000 taxable distribution to a member on 10.5% marginal tax rate. 10 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Filing end-of-year returns What you must provide to us At the end of each year all Māori authorities must complete and return the following returns to help us determine the right amount of tax has been paid. •Income tax return: Māori authorities - IR8, unless they have an exemption . This return provides a complete statement of the authority's taxable income •Annual Māori authority credit account return - IR8J •Māori authority distribution statement. What to include on the IR8J All Māori authorities maintaining a MACA must complete an end-of-year Annual Māori authority credit account return - IR8J. You must show the following information in this return: •opening balance •amount and source of all debits •amount and source of all credits •closing balance. A Māori authority must file its IR8 return by the due date for filing its income tax return for the corresponding income year. Limits on income tax refund Income tax refunds will generally be limited to the amount of the credit closing balance at the most recently ended MACA year. For example, a refund of income tax being issued 31 May 2011 will be limited to the credit balance in the MACA as at 31 March 2011. This is because some of the credits that were in the MACA have already been attached to distributions paid to members. The balance of the income tax credit that hasn't been refunded will be automatically transferred to the following financial year as a provisional tax payment. If the MACA closing balance is nil or a debit, the Māori authority won't be entitled to receive any income tax refund. Māori authority distribution statement A Māori authority that makes a distribution to a member must, at the time it makes the distribution, complete and retain a distribution statement. The distribution statement must include: •the name of the Māori authority •the name, address, and IRD number of the member who is receiving the distribution •the date the distribution is made •the total amount of distribution made •the amount of the distribution made to the member, including what portion is a taxable distribution and what portion is a non- taxable distribution •the total amount of Māori authority credits attached to the distribution or treated as being attached to the distribution (shown as a nil amount if Māori authority credits are not attached) •any more information the Commissioner may require. All Māori authorities maintaining a MACA must complete a statement advising us of the total amount of distributions of credits made to their members. If no distributions have been made, a nil statement must be completed. File this with the Income tax return: Māori authorities - IR8. Members' distribution statement All Māori authorities maintaining a MACA and making distribution to their members must provide them with a distribution statement. This tells them about distributions they receive so they can, if necessary, complete their personal tax returns. 11 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Paying further income tax If the MACA has a debit balance at 31 March the authority must make a payment, "further income tax", to clear the debit balance. The authority gets a benefit from the further income tax payment. It can be used to meet any income tax liability that they become liable for after the payment is made. Penalties that may apply Overdue further income tax If a Māori authority has a debit balance in its MACA at 31 March it will automatically incur a 10% penalty on the further income tax due - a Māori authority distribution penalty tax. This is to encourage Māori authorities to have a credit closing balance. Both further income tax and Māori authority distribution penalty tax are due by 20 June following the end of the MACA year. Late payment penalty An extra 1% late payment penalty is charged on any balance over $100 which is outstanding after 20 June, plus 4% of the amount of tax to pay at the end of the 7th day after the due date. Note If a Māori authority stops being a Māori authority and a debit balance exists, the authority must clear that debit no later than the last day on which the organisation is still a Māori authority. If this amount isn't paid by the due date, late payment penalties may apply. For more information about penalties and interest, go to our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. If you receive income from a Māori authority It's important members receiving distributions from Māori authorities understand their own personal income tax responsibilities. Distributions from Māori authorities now have credits attached to them. Credits received that exceed the Māori authority member's tax liability may be refunded to the Māori authority member. However, we are entitled to use the Māori authority credits to meet any other tax payments payable by the member, for example, any tax arrears. A refund will be made where there's still a credit after all tax liabilities have been met. Distribution statements A member should also receive a distribution statement from a Māori authority. If you're a member, this information will assist you when completing your personal income tax return or when requesting a personal tax summary. IRD numbers If you're a member receiving taxable distributions from a Māori authority, make sure you give your IRD number to the Māori authority. The authority can then apply the current tax rate of 17.5% to the distribution, instead of the 33% no-notification rate that will apply if you don't supply an IRD number. RWT paid Any RWT paid on taxable Māori authority distributions should be included with total RWT paid on interest. However, it is essential to attach a note to the return to explain the source of RWT and why there was no accompanying interest income as this makes return processing more efficient. 12 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Services you may need myIR You can manage your tax and entitlements online with a myIR account.

This guide is for people who administer the accounts for a Māori authority. Like all other taxpayers, Māori authorities have general tax requirements and are required to maintain records about their business and non-business activities for seven years. There are also some special tax rules that apply to Māori authorities. These relate to: •record keeping in a special account called the Māori authority credit account (MACA) •attaching credits to distributions. These are covered in more detail in this guide. If you have elected to be a Māori authority, you must follow these rules. You can opt out at any time but must let us know. For more information see Becoming a Māori authority - IR487. The Māori authority credit system Like all other taxpayers, Māori authorities are required to maintain records about their business and non-business activities for 7 years. You can find out more about record keeping and tax requirements at ird.govt.nz/records or download our Smart business - IR320 guide. What is a Māori authority credit? Māori authorities can choose to attach credits to the distributions they pay out to their members for the income tax already paid by the authority, so profits are not taxed twice. The amount attached is called a Māori authority credit. How the credit system works The credit system applies to all income tax. The following example shows how it works. Example Tax on Māori authority Māori authority profit$1,000 Tax at 17.5%$ 175 After-tax profit$ 825 Distribution paid to members$ 825 Retained earningsNil Tax on member Distribution received$ 825 Māori authority credit$ 175 Taxable amount$1,000 Tax at (say) 17.5%$ 175 Less Māori authority credit$ 175 Tax payable by memberNil Result for member Cash distribution received$ 825 Less tax payableNil Net distribution after tax$ 825 4 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Record keeping in the Māori authority credit account (MACA) The MACA records: •how much income tax a Māori authority has paid on its income •Māori authority tax credits available for allocation with distributions. It has: •an opening balance •credit and debit entries •a closing balance. Who must keep a MACA? All Māori authorities must set up a MACA except: •those whose rules don't allow it to distribute its income or property to members, or •those that only derive exempt income, not including certain dividends, within a wholly owned group. Period covered by the MACA A MACA covers the period from 1 April in one year to 31 March in the following year, regardless of an authority's balance date. This period is called the MACA year or imputation year. An authority with a balance date other than 31 March cannot line up its MACA year with its accounting year. You have to maintain these records for 7 years. Transactions recorded in the MACA Opening balance The opening balance of the MACA (which may be either a debit or credit) is the same as the closing balance of the preceding MACA year. When a Māori authority enters the Māori authority rules they will have a nil opening balance. They will need to record credit and debit entries in the MACA. Credit entries These entries increase the credits available for distribution to members. They are recorded in dollar amounts. 1. New Zealand income tax paid during the tax year to meet a provisional tax obligation or to satisfy an income tax liability. There are exceptions for income tax paid in the following circumstances: –any income tax that would have been payable had the MACA year ended on the day immediately before the day the Māori authority became a Māori authority –income tax paid by using credits the Māori authority already holds in its MACA that it has received from income from another Māori authority –a payment of "further income tax" credited against any income tax or provisional tax that happens after the payment of the further income tax –an allocation of any overpayment of provisional tax by a Māori authority. 2. Further income tax the Māori authority paid to reduce the previous year's closing debit balance. For more information, see page 5. 3. Māori authority credits attached to distributions received from other Māori authorities. 4. Imputation credits attached to a dividend that is paid to the Māori authority. 5. FDP (foreign dividend payment) credits attached to dividends received by Māori authorities that don't have an FDP account. 6. An adjustment, which has subsequently been overturned, to offset a previous debit that has arisen from a determination that the credits are subject to an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage. 7. RWT deducted from income that the Māori authority receives. In most cases, credit entries occur in the MACA on the date the transaction that caused them takes place - the date of payment. This happens regardless of the period it relates to. 5 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Debit entries These entries reduce the amount of credit available for distribution to members. Like credits, they're also recorded in dollar amounts. 1. Māori authority credits attached to the distributions paid by the Māori authority to its members. 2. The amount of any overpaid provisional tax allocated by the Māori authority to satisfy any provisional tax of another wholly owned Māori authority. 3. Income tax refunds received during the income year except where the refund: –is for income tax related to an income year where the Māori authority did not maintain a MACA –relates to a part of a year in which the Māori authority did not operate a MACA. 4. An "allocation debit" entry when the Māori authority credit ratio of any subsequent Māori authority taxable distribution differs from that of the "benchmark" distribution and a "ratio change declaration" hasn't been made. For more information, see below. 5. Refund of FDP paid to the Māori authority where the Māori authority is not a "foreign dividend account" company. 6. Adjustments when a change of shareholding of more than 34% has taken place. For more information see page 6. 7. Any overpaid income tax applied by Inland Revenue for tax liabilities other than income tax or provisional tax instalments. 8. An apportionment of income tax for the number of days the organisation was a recognised Māori authority. 9. An amount equal to the credit balance immediately before a Māori authority ceases to be a Māori authority. 10. Adjustments made when we consider an arrangement has been made to obtain a tax advantage. 11. Adjustments made to eliminate any unused credit balance affected by the loss of continuity if membership of the authority. In most cases, a debit entry appears in the MACA on the date of the transaction. Closing balance This is the result of taking the opening balance and adding the credit entries then deducting the debit entries. If the closing balance is a credit, the Māori authority has tax credits that it can use next year such as attaching the credit to a distribution. If the closing balance is a debit, the authority has allocated more tax than it has paid. A payment of further income tax is required to be made by 20 June to clear the debit balance. A 10% Māori authority distribution penalty tax is also payable. Benchmark distribution A distribution is a transfer of value (such as a payment of interest, principal or dividend) from the Māori authority to its members. The first taxable Māori authority distribution made by a Māori authority in any tax year is called the benchmark distribution. This sets the ratio between the credits and dividends for the rest of the tax year. If there are changes to the benchmark ratio of subsequent dividends, the Ratio change declaration - IR407 form must be completed. See 'Ratio change declaration' below. For examples of different types of distributions, see page 9. Māori authority credit ratio This credit ratio is calculated using the following formula: Māori authority credit net distribution where: Māori authority credit is the amount of the Māori authority credit attached to the distribution and, if a Māori authority credit is not attached, that amount is zero. Net distribution is the amount of the distribution by the Māori authority, not including any Māori authority credit. The ratio of Māori authority credits attached to the benchmark distribution will generally determine the ratio that all other distributions in that MACA year must take. If a Māori authority tries to distribute Māori authority credits at a higher ratio to the one set by its benchmark distribution, it will have to pay an "allocation debit" penalty, unless it declares the ratio change. Ratio change declaration To declare the change, complete a Ratio change declaration - IR407 form. Note If a MACA goes into debit throughout the year it must pay any debit balance that exists at 31 March on or before the following 20 June. 6 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Attaching Māori authority credits to distributions A Māori authority may choose whether to attach credits to the distributions it pays to its members. However, if it chooses to do so it must follow certain rules. Māori authority tax rate and maximum ratio The Māori authority tax rate is 17.5%. Māori authorities are free to decide whether to attach a Māori authority credit to distributions they pay, but there is a maximum ratio of credit to distributions that can be allocated. If this ratio is exceeded, the Māori authority would effectively be passing on more credits to its members than tax it has paid on the profits from which those distributions were paid. Example Māori authority profit $ 100.00 Tax @ 17.5% $ 17.50 Tax paid profit $ 82.50 The Māori authority has paid $17.50 of tax on the $82.50 available for distribution. The base ratio is therefore 21.21 cents in the dollar ($17.50 ÷ $82.50). Resident withholding tax (RWT) RWT is a tax deducted from investment income, like Māori authority dividends, before the investor, or beneficiary, receives it. The amount of RWT to pay is: •17.5% if a the member's IRD number is recorded •39% if the member’s IRD number is not recorded. Māori authority does not have the member's IRD number and the distribution exceeds $200, in which case the tax rate is 39%, reduced by any Māori authority credits attached, up to a maximum rate of 17.5%. This amount is reduced by any Māori authority credits attached, up to a maximum rate of 17.5%. This means that people who receive Māori authority dividends don't have to pay all the tax in a lump sum at the end of the year. People who don't declare their dividends still have tax deducted from it. In these circumstances, we still follow up on undeclared income, and take action against people who don't declare it. Taxable Māori authority distributions are also subject to RWT if the: •Māori authority decides not to attach any credits to the distribution •credits attached are less than 17.5% of the gross distribution. Example Mere is a member in a Māori authority and has provided an IRD number. The Māori authority makes a distribution to Mere of $90, which is made up of $80 in cash and $10 in Māori authority credits. The Māori authority must withhold a further $5.75 in tax so that Mere only receives $74.25 in cash. Net distribution $ 74.25 Māori authority credits $ 10.00 RWT $ 5.75 $ 15.75 Gross distribution $ 90.00 The total tax paid by way of credits and RWT is $15.75, which is 17.5% of the gross distribution of $90. Companies must hold 66% membership to pass on credits Where a Māori authority is a company, credits can only be passed on to members of a Māori authority if at least 66% of those members remain with the authority from the time the credits arise, to the date they're distributed to the members. If the membership of a Māori authority changes by more than 34%, the Māori authority has lost membership continuity. This rule is set in place to prevent members who did not hold their shares at the time the Māori authority credit arose, being able to use the Māori authority credits they receive as part of any future distribution. In this situation, a Māori authority must enter a debit entry into the Māori authority credit account (MACA). 7 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Special transitional rules Māori authority credits are often distributed in a different tax year from when the relevant tax was paid. So, there are some special rules to cover the change in the tax rate during the transitional period. These apply from the start of a Māori authority's 2011-12 income year until 31 March 2013. Ratio of tax credits to distributions The tax rate determines the maximum ratio of Māori authority credits your Māori authority can attach to distributions it makes. From the start of the 2011-12 income year, the ratio is 17.5:82.5, ie, you can attach $17.50 of credits to each $82.50 of distributions made. Applying this maximum is straightforward when attaching credits that relate to tax paid at the current tax rate of 17.5%. However, making this change immediately to all distributions could risk disadvantaging members, if the authority still has credits in its credit account or FDP account that relate to tax paid at 19.5%. During the transitional period, a Māori authority can choose to continue attaching credits that relate to 19.5% tax at up to the previous maximum ratio of 19.5:80.5 if: •the MACA has a credit balance at the start of its 2011-12 income year and the 19.5% tax rate was used, or •it pays any income tax at the previous 19.5% rate after that date, or •it receives tax credits (eg, as a member of another Māori authority) after that date, that were imputed at over 17.5:82.5. After 31 March 2013, the maximum ratio of 17.5:82.5 will be charged for all distributions, regardless of which tax rate the tax credit relates to. Example 1 The Māori authority has credits to allocate during the transitional period: Taxable income (2010-11 return) $ 10,000 Māori authority credit for tax paid at 19.5% $ 1,950 On 1 September 2011, the authority allocates credits for a distribution payment to its members. Distribution payment 1 September 2011 $ 80.50 Credits attached for tax paid at 19.5% $ 19.50 Total distributions $ 100 Even though the 17.5% tax rate now applies for income tax currently payable, the maximum Māori authority credit ratio remains 19.5:80.5 for this allocation because these credits relate to tax paid at the 19.5% rate. After this distribution, the authority still has $1,930.50 of credits remaining in its MACA that it can attach at the 19.5:80.5 any time up to 31 March 2013. Example 2 A Māori authority began trading during 2010 and has earned a sum of Māori authority credits for tax it paid at 19.5%. Taxable income (2010-11 return) $ 1,000 Māori authority credit for tax paid at 19.5% $ 195 On 26 March 2012, in the last week of the 2011-12 tax year, the authority makes its first distributions to members. Distributions made $ 805 Credits imputed at 19.5:80.5 (maximum) $ 195 Total distribution $ 1,000 The debit for this distribution matches the full amount of Māori authority credits in its MACA that relate to tax paid at 19.5%. If the authority later makes a further distribution, attaching Māori authority credits for tax it paid in the 2011-12 income year (at 17.5%) because it's already allocated all 19.5%-related credits in its MACA, the 17.5:82.5 maximum applies. If it gains no more 19.5%-related credits, the new maximum applies for all its future distributions. 8 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Recording credits and debits in memorandum accounts If your Māori authority chooses to continue imputing credits at over 17.5:82.5 (up to 19.5:80.5), it needs to track which credit and debit entries in its MACA relate to the 19.5% tax rate. This rule also applies to group MACA records and FDP accounts. This tracking ensures your Māori authority: •does not over-allocate the credits, and •provides correct data in its Māori authority/FDP return. However, each Māori authority must maintain only a single memorandum account and file a single return. Variation from benchmark distribution ratio If the Māori authority tax rate change is the sole reason for a Māori authority credit ratio of credits attached to any subsequent distribution from that set by the first benchmark distribution, you don’t need to file a Ratio change declaration - IR407. Example 3 In Example 2 on page 28, the first distribution payment set the benchmark distribution ratio for the 2011-12 tax year at 19.5:80.5. The second payment's ratio was 17.5:82.5, but this variation was only due to the tax rate change, so the authority does not have to declare the ratio change before issuing the distribution. Variation from previous year's ratio When submitting your Māori authority's annual return, we require an explanation if the authority's ratio for the year overall varies more than 20% from the ratio in your previous year's return. In determining whether you need to give an explanation, you can ignore any portion of the variation that exists because of the change in tax rate. Example 4 Your overall ratio this year varies 22% from last year's. • You don't need to explain if it's made up of: - 3% due to the tax rate change, and - 19% due to other factors. • You do need to explain if it's made up of: - 1% due to the tax rate change, and - 21% due to other factors. Ignoring the tax rate impact, the variation is still over 20%. Last day for using transitional ratio A Māori authority can make distributions imputed at more than 17.5:82.5 up till 31 March 2013. After this date, they must use the maximum Māori authority ratio of 17.5:82.5 for all distributions, regardless of the tax rate the tax credits relate to. 9 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Making distributions to Māori authority members Types of distributions Distribution typeExample The amount paid or credited by the Māori authority to a member in any manner or under any name. A taxable bonus issue made by the Māori authority. An amount applied by the Māori authority exclusively for the member. A Māori authority may pay a member's electricity bill. Although this amount is not paid or credited to the member, it's treated as a distribution as it's applied for the benefit of that member. An amount advanced by the Māori authority to a member to the extent that the advancement is not a genuine investment by the Māori authority. A Māori authority may extend an, interest-free loan to a member. As they would have received interest if they had invested that money in a bank, the interest forgone by the Māori authority is treated as a distribution to the member who received it. Property disposed of by the Māori authority to a member without payment in cash or kind or where the payment is less than the market value of the property. A Māori authority owns a hectare of land with a market value of $30,000. If the Māori authority sells that land to a member for $20,000, the $10,000 difference between the market value and the actual price paid will be treated as a distribution to the member. Property disposed of by a member to the Māori authority for more than the market value of the property. A Māori authority member owns a hectare of land with a market value of $30,000 that the Māori authority wishes to use for its own purposes. If the Māori authority were to pay $40,000 for the land, the $10,000 that the member receives over and above the market value of the land will be treated as a distribution. Taxable and non-taxable distributions Māori authorities must ensure that in distributing this income to members, members receive proportionate shares of both taxable and non-taxable incomes. Taxable distributions include as their source: •gross income of the Māori authority •that gross income not exempt from tax. Non-taxable distributions include as their source: •exempt income •tax paid income received under other tax type rules. Example A Māori authority of two members wishes to distribute $2,000. Of the $2,000, $1,000 is a taxable Māori authority distribution, and the other $1,000 is not. The Māori authority cannot "stream"\* the taxable Māori authority distribution to the member who has most use for any Māori authority credits that may be attached. Instead, the Māori authority must distribute a $500 taxable Māori authority distribution and a $500 other distribution to each of the two members. \* "Stream" means to be selective about who gets allocated income or tax credits based on the best tax result. In the example the authority cannot allocate the non-taxable distribution to a member on say 39% marginal tax rate and allocate the $1,000 taxable distribution to a member on 10.5% marginal tax rate. 10 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Filing end-of-year returns What you must provide to us At the end of each year all Māori authorities must complete and return the following returns to help us determine the right amount of tax has been paid. •Income tax return: Māori authorities - IR8, unless they have an exemption . This return provides a complete statement of the authority's taxable income •Annual Māori authority credit account return - IR8J •Māori authority distribution statement. What to include on the IR8J All Māori authorities maintaining a MACA must complete an end-of-year Annual Māori authority credit account return - IR8J. You must show the following information in this return: •opening balance •amount and source of all debits •amount and source of all credits •closing balance. A Māori authority must file its IR8 return by the due date for filing its income tax return for the corresponding income year. Limits on income tax refund Income tax refunds will generally be limited to the amount of the credit closing balance at the most recently ended MACA year. For example, a refund of income tax being issued 31 May 2011 will be limited to the credit balance in the MACA as at 31 March 2011. This is because some of the credits that were in the MACA have already been attached to distributions paid to members. The balance of the income tax credit that hasn't been refunded will be automatically transferred to the following financial year as a provisional tax payment. If the MACA closing balance is nil or a debit, the Māori authority will not be entitled to receive any income tax refund. Māori authority distribution statement A Māori authority that makes a distribution to a member must, at the time it makes the distribution, complete and retain a distribution statement. The distribution statement must include: •the name of the Māori authority •the name, address, and IRD number of the member who is receiving the distribution •the date the distribution is made •the total amount of distribution made •the amount of the distribution made to the member, including what portion is a taxable distribution and what portion is a non- taxable distribution •the total amount of Māori authority credits attached to the distribution or treated as being attached to the distribution (shown as a nil amount if Māori authority credits are not attached) •any more information the Commissioner may require. All Māori authorities maintaining a MACA must complete a statement advising us of the total amount of distributions of credits made to their members. If no distributions have been made, a nil statement must be completed. File this with the Income tax return: Māori authorities - IR8. Members' distribution statement All Māori authorities maintaining a MACA and making distribution to their members must provide them with a distribution statement. This tells them about distributions they receive so they can, if necessary, complete their personal tax returns. 11 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Paying further income tax If the MACA has a debit balance at 31 March the authority must make a payment, "further income tax", to clear the debit balance. The authority gets a benefit from the further income tax payment. It can be used to meet any income tax liability that they become liable for after the payment is made. Penalties that may apply Overdue further income tax If a Māori authority has a debit balance in its MACA at 31 March it will automatically incur a 10% penalty on the further income tax due - a Māori authority distribution penalty tax. This is to encourage Māori authorities to have a credit closing balance. Both further income tax and Māori authority distribution penalty tax are due by 20 June following the end of the MACA year. Late payment penalty An extra 1% late payment penalty is charged on any balance over $100 which is outstanding after 20 June, plus 4% of the amount of tax to pay at the end of the 7th day after the due date. Note If a Māori authority stops being a Māori authority and a debit balance exists, the authority must clear that debit no later than the last day on which the organisation is still a Māori authority. If this amount is not paid by the due date, late payment penalties may apply. For more information about penalties and interest, go to our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. If you receive income from a Māori authority It's important members receiving distributions from Māori authorities understand their own personal income tax responsibilities. Distributions from Māori authorities now have credits attached to them. Credits received that exceed the Māori authority member's tax liability may be refunded to the Māori authority member. However, we are entitled to use the Māori authority credits to meet any other tax payments payable by the member, for example, any tax arrears. A refund will be made where there's still a credit after all tax liabilities have been met. Distribution statements A member should also receive a distribution statement from a Māori authority. If you're a member, this information will assist you when completing your personal income tax return or when requesting a personal tax summary. IRD numbers If you're a member receiving taxable distributions from a Māori authority, make sure you give your IRD number to the Māori authority. The authority can then apply the current tax rate of 17.5% to the distribution, instead of the 39% no-notification rate that will apply if you don't supply an IRD number. RWT paid Any RWT paid on taxable Māori authority distributions should be included with total RWT paid on interest. However, it is essential to attach a note to the return to explain the source of RWT and why there was no accompanying interest income as this makes return processing more efficient. 12 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Services you may need myIR You can manage your tax and entitlements online with a myIR account.

This guide is for people who administer the accounts for a Māori authority. Like all other taxpayers, Māori authorities have general tax requirements and are required to maintain records about their business and non-business activities for seven years. There are also some special tax rules that apply to Māori authorities. These relate to: •record keeping in a special account called the Māori authority credit account (MACA) •attaching credits to distributions. These are covered in more detail in this guide. If you have elected to be a Māori authority, you must follow these rules. You can opt out at any time but must let us know. For more information see Becoming a Māori authority - IR487. The Māori authority credit system Like all other taxpayers, Māori authorities are required to maintain records about their business and non-business activities for 7 years. You can find out more about record keeping and tax requirements at ird.govt.nz/records or download our Smart business - IR320 guide. What is a Māori authority credit? Māori authorities can choose to attach credits to the distributions they pay out to their members for the income tax already paid by the authority, so profits are not taxed twice. The amount attached is called a Māori authority credit. How the credit system works The credit system applies to all income tax. The following example shows how it works. Example Tax on Māori authority Māori authority profit$1,000 Tax at 17.5%$ 175 After-tax profit$ 825 Distribution paid to members$ 825 Retained earningsNil Tax on member Distribution received$ 825 Māori authority credit$ 175 Taxable amount$1,000 Tax at (say) 17.5%$ 175 Less Māori authority credit$ 175 Tax payable by memberNil Result for member Cash distribution received$ 825 Less tax payableNil Net distribution after tax$ 825 4 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Record keeping in the Māori authority credit account (MACA) The MACA records: •how much income tax a Māori authority has paid on its income •Māori authority tax credits available for allocation with distributions. It has: •an opening balance •credit and debit entries •a closing balance. Who must keep a MACA? All Māori authorities must set up a MACA except: •those whose rules don't allow it to distribute its income or property to members, or •those that only derive exempt income, not including certain dividends, within a wholly owned group. Period covered by the MACA A MACA covers the period from 1 April in one year to 31 March in the following year, regardless of an authority's balance date. This period is called the MACA year or imputation year. An authority with a balance date other than 31 March cannot line up its MACA year with its accounting year. You have to maintain these records for 7 years. Transactions recorded in the MACA Opening balance The opening balance of the MACA (which may be either a debit or credit) is the same as the closing balance of the preceding MACA year. When a Māori authority enters the Māori authority rules they will have a nil opening balance. They will need to record credit and debit entries in the MACA. Credit entries These entries increase the credits available for distribution to members. They are recorded in dollar amounts. 1. New Zealand income tax paid during the tax year to meet a provisional tax obligation or to satisfy an income tax liability. There are exceptions for income tax paid in the following circumstances: –any income tax that would have been payable had the MACA year ended on the day immediately before the day the Māori authority became a Māori authority –income tax paid by using credits the Māori authority already holds in its MACA that it has received from income from another Māori authority –a payment of "further income tax" credited against any income tax or provisional tax that happens after the payment of the further income tax –an allocation of any overpayment of provisional tax by a Māori authority. 2. Further income tax the Māori authority paid to reduce the previous year's closing debit balance. For more information, see page 5. 3. Māori authority credits attached to distributions received from other Māori authorities. 4. Imputation credits attached to a dividend that is paid to the Māori authority. 5. FDP (foreign dividend payment) credits attached to dividends received by Māori authorities that don't have an FDP account. 6. An adjustment, which has subsequently been overturned, to offset a previous debit that has arisen from a determination that the credits are subject to an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage. 7. RWT deducted from income that the Māori authority receives. In most cases, credit entries occur in the MACA on the date the transaction that caused them takes place - the date of payment. This happens regardless of the period it relates to. 5 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Debit entries These entries reduce the amount of credit available for distribution to members. Like credits, they're also recorded in dollar amounts. 1. Māori authority credits attached to the distributions paid by the Māori authority to its members. 2. The amount of any overpaid provisional tax allocated by the Māori authority to satisfy any provisional tax of another wholly owned Māori authority. 3. Income tax refunds received during the income year except where the refund: –is for income tax related to an income year where the Māori authority did not maintain a MACA –relates to a part of a year in which the Māori authority did not operate a MACA. 4. An "allocation debit" entry when the Māori authority credit ratio of any subsequent Māori authority taxable distribution differs from that of the "benchmark" distribution and a "ratio change declaration" hasn't been made. For more information, see below. 5. Refund of FDP paid to the Māori authority where the Māori authority is not a "foreign dividend account" company. 6. Adjustments when a change of shareholding of more than 34% has taken place. For more information see page 6. 7. Any overpaid income tax applied by Inland Revenue for tax liabilities other than income tax or provisional tax instalments. 8. An apportionment of income tax for the number of days the organisation was a recognised Māori authority. 9. An amount equal to the credit balance immediately before a Māori authority ceases to be a Māori authority. 10. Adjustments made when we consider an arrangement has been made to obtain a tax advantage. 11. Adjustments made to eliminate any unused credit balance affected by the loss of continuity if membership of the authority. In most cases, a debit entry appears in the MACA on the date of the transaction. Closing balance This is the result of taking the opening balance and adding the credit entries then deducting the debit entries. If the closing balance is a credit, the Māori authority has tax credits that it can use next year such as attaching the credit to a distribution. If the closing balance is a debit, the authority has allocated more tax than it has paid. A payment of further income tax is required to be made by 20 June to clear the debit balance. A 10% Māori authority distribution penalty tax is also payable. Benchmark distribution A distribution is a transfer of value (such as a payment of interest, principal or dividend) from the Māori authority to its members. The first taxable Māori authority distribution made by a Māori authority in any tax year is called the benchmark distribution. This sets the ratio between the credits and dividends for the rest of the tax year. If there are changes to the benchmark ratio of subsequent dividends, the Ratio change declaration - IR407 form must be completed. See 'Ratio change declaration' below. For examples of different types of distributions, see page 9. Māori authority credit ratio This credit ratio is calculated using the following formula: Māori authority credit net distribution where: Māori authority credit is the amount of the Māori authority credit attached to the distribution and, if a Māori authority credit is not attached, that amount is zero. Net distribution is the amount of the distribution by the Māori authority, not including any Māori authority credit. The ratio of Māori authority credits attached to the benchmark distribution will generally determine the ratio that all other distributions in that MACA year must take. If a Māori authority tries to distribute Māori authority credits at a higher ratio to the one set by its benchmark distribution, it will have to pay an "allocation debit" penalty, unless it declares the ratio change. Ratio change declaration To declare the change, complete a Ratio change declaration - IR407 form. Note If a MACA goes into debit throughout the year it must pay any debit balance that exists at 31 March on or before the following 20 June. 6 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Attaching Māori authority credits to distributions A Māori authority may choose whether to attach credits to the distributions it pays to its members. However, if it chooses to do so it must follow certain rules. Māori authority tax rate and maximum ratio The Māori authority tax rate is 17.5%. Māori authorities are free to decide whether to attach a Māori authority credit to distributions they pay, but there is a maximum ratio of credit to distributions that can be allocated. If this ratio is exceeded, the Māori authority would effectively be passing on more credits to its members than tax it has paid on the profits from which those distributions were paid. Example Māori authority profit $ 100.00 Tax @ 17.5% $ 17.50 Tax paid profit $ 82.50 The Māori authority has paid $17.50 of tax on the $82.50 available for distribution. The base ratio is therefore 21.21 cents in the dollar ($17.50 ÷ $82.50). Resident withholding tax (RWT) RWT is a tax deducted from investment income, like Māori authority dividends, before the investor, or beneficiary, receives it. The amount of RWT to pay is: •17.5% if a the member's IRD number is recorded •39% if the member’s IRD number is not recorded. Māori authority does not have the member's IRD number and the distribution exceeds $200, in which case the tax rate is 39%, reduced by any Māori authority credits attached, up to a maximum rate of 17.5%. This amount is reduced by any Māori authority credits attached, up to a maximum rate of 17.5%. This means that people who receive Māori authority dividends don't have to pay all the tax in a lump sum at the end of the year. People who don't declare their dividends still have tax deducted from it. In these circumstances, we still follow up on undeclared income, and take action against people who don't declare it. Taxable Māori authority distributions are also subject to RWT if the: •Māori authority decides not to attach any credits to the distribution •credits attached are less than 17.5% of the gross distribution. Example Mere is a member in a Māori authority and has provided an IRD number. The Māori authority makes a distribution to Mere of $90, which is made up of $80 in cash and $10 in Māori authority credits. The Māori authority must withhold a further $5.75 in tax so that Mere only receives $74.25 in cash. Net distribution $ 74.25 Māori authority credits $ 10.00 RWT $ 5.75 $ 15.75 Gross distribution $ 90.00 The total tax paid by way of credits and RWT is $15.75, which is 17.5% of the gross distribution of $90. Companies must hold 66% membership to pass on credits Where a Māori authority is a company, credits can only be passed on to members of a Māori authority if at least 66% of those members remain with the authority from the time the credits arise, to the date they're distributed to the members. If the membership of a Māori authority changes by more than 34%, the Māori authority has lost membership continuity. This rule is set in place to prevent members who did not hold their shares at the time the Māori authority credit arose, being able to use the Māori authority credits they receive as part of any future distribution. In this situation, a Māori authority must enter a debit entry into the Māori authority credit account (MACA). 7 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Special transitional rules Māori authority credits are often distributed in a different tax year from when the relevant tax was paid. So, there are some special rules to cover the change in the tax rate during the transitional period. These apply from the start of a Māori authority's 2011-12 income year until 31 March 2013. Ratio of tax credits to distributions The tax rate determines the maximum ratio of Māori authority credits your Māori authority can attach to distributions it makes. From the start of the 2011-12 income year, the ratio is 17.5:82.5, ie, you can attach $17.50 of credits to each $82.50 of distributions made. Applying this maximum is straightforward when attaching credits that relate to tax paid at the current tax rate of 17.5%. However, making this change immediately to all distributions could risk disadvantaging members, if the authority still has credits in its credit account or FDP account that relate to tax paid at 19.5%. During the transitional period, a Māori authority can choose to continue attaching credits that relate to 19.5% tax at up to the previous maximum ratio of 19.5:80.5 if: •the MACA has a credit balance at the start of its 2011-12 income year and the 19.5% tax rate was used, or •it pays any income tax at the previous 19.5% rate after that date, or •it receives tax credits (eg, as a member of another Māori authority) after that date, that were imputed at over 17.5:82.5. After 31 March 2013, the maximum ratio of 17.5:82.5 will be charged for all distributions, regardless of which tax rate the tax credit relates to. Example 1 The Māori authority has credits to allocate during the transitional period: Taxable income (2010-11 return) $ 10,000 Māori authority credit for tax paid at 19.5% $ 1,950 On 1 September 2011, the authority allocates credits for a distribution payment to its members. Distribution payment 1 September 2011 $ 80.50 Credits attached for tax paid at 19.5% $ 19.50 Total distributions $ 100 Even though the 17.5% tax rate now applies for income tax currently payable, the maximum Māori authority credit ratio remains 19.5:80.5 for this allocation because these credits relate to tax paid at the 19.5% rate. After this distribution, the authority still has $1,930.50 of credits remaining in its MACA that it can attach at the 19.5:80.5 any time up to 31 March 2013. Example 2 A Māori authority began trading during 2010 and has earned a sum of Māori authority credits for tax it paid at 19.5%. Taxable income (2010-11 return) $ 1,000 Māori authority credit for tax paid at 19.5% $ 195 On 26 March 2012, in the last week of the 2011-12 tax year, the authority makes its first distributions to members. Distributions made $ 805 Credits imputed at 19.5:80.5 (maximum) $ 195 Total distribution $ 1,000 The debit for this distribution matches the full amount of Māori authority credits in its MACA that relate to tax paid at 19.5%. If the authority later makes a further distribution, attaching Māori authority credits for tax it paid in the 2011-12 income year (at 17.5%) because it's already allocated all 19.5%-related credits in its MACA, the 17.5:82.5 maximum applies. If it gains no more 19.5%-related credits, the new maximum applies for all its future distributions. 8 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Recording credits and debits in memorandum accounts If your Māori authority chooses to continue imputing credits at over 17.5:82.5 (up to 19.5:80.5), it needs to track which credit and debit entries in its MACA relate to the 19.5% tax rate. This rule also applies to group MACA records and FDP accounts. This tracking ensures your Māori authority: •does not over-allocate the credits, and •provides correct data in its Māori authority/FDP return. However, each Māori authority must maintain only a single memorandum account and file a single return. Variation from benchmark distribution ratio If the Māori authority tax rate change is the sole reason for a Māori authority credit ratio of credits attached to any subsequent distribution from that set by the first benchmark distribution, you don’t need to file a Ratio change declaration - IR407. Example 3 In Example 2 on page 28, the first distribution payment set the benchmark distribution ratio for the 2011-12 tax year at 19.5:80.5. The second payment's ratio was 17.5:82.5, but this variation was only due to the tax rate change, so the authority does not have to declare the ratio change before issuing the distribution. Variation from previous year's ratio When submitting your Māori authority's annual return, we require an explanation if the authority's ratio for the year overall varies more than 20% from the ratio in your previous year's return. In determining whether you need to give an explanation, you can ignore any portion of the variation that exists because of the change in tax rate. Example 4 Your overall ratio this year varies 22% from last year's. • You don't need to explain if it's made up of: - 3% due to the tax rate change, and - 19% due to other factors. • You do need to explain if it's made up of: - 1% due to the tax rate change, and - 21% due to other factors. Ignoring the tax rate impact, the variation is still over 20%. Last day for using transitional ratio A Māori authority can make distributions imputed at more than 17.5:82.5 up till 31 March 2013. After this date, they must use the maximum Māori authority ratio of 17.5:82.5 for all distributions, regardless of the tax rate the tax credits relate to. 9 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Making distributions to Māori authority members Types of distributions Distribution typeExample The amount paid or credited by the Māori authority to a member in any manner or under any name. A taxable bonus issue made by the Māori authority. An amount applied by the Māori authority exclusively for the member. A Māori authority may pay a member's electricity bill. Although this amount is not paid or credited to the member, it's treated as a distribution as it's applied for the benefit of that member. An amount advanced by the Māori authority to a member to the extent that the advancement is not a genuine investment by the Māori authority. A Māori authority may extend an, interest-free loan to a member. As they would have received interest if they had invested that money in a bank, the interest forgone by the Māori authority is treated as a distribution to the member who received it. Property disposed of by the Māori authority to a member without payment in cash or kind or where the payment is less than the market value of the property. A Māori authority owns a hectare of land with a market value of $30,000. If the Māori authority sells that land to a member for $20,000, the $10,000 difference between the market value and the actual price paid will be treated as a distribution to the member. Property disposed of by a member to the Māori authority for more than the market value of the property. A Māori authority member owns a hectare of land with a market value of $30,000 that the Māori authority wishes to use for its own purposes. If the Māori authority were to pay $40,000 for the land, the $10,000 that the member receives over and above the market value of the land will be treated as a distribution. Taxable and non-taxable distributions Māori authorities must ensure that in distributing this income to members, members receive proportionate shares of both taxable and non-taxable incomes. Taxable distributions include as their source: •gross income of the Māori authority •that gross income not exempt from tax. Non-taxable distributions include as their source: •exempt income •tax paid income received under other tax type rules. Example A Māori authority of two members wishes to distribute $2,000. Of the $2,000, $1,000 is a taxable Māori authority distribution, and the other $1,000 is not. The Māori authority cannot "stream"\* the taxable Māori authority distribution to the member who has most use for any Māori authority credits that may be attached. Instead, the Māori authority must distribute a $500 taxable Māori authority distribution and a $500 other distribution to each of the two members. \* "Stream" means to be selective about who gets allocated income or tax credits based on the best tax result. In the example the authority cannot allocate the non-taxable distribution to a member on say 39% marginal tax rate and allocate the $1,000 taxable distribution to a member on 10.5% marginal tax rate. 10 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Filing end-of-year returns What you must provide to us At the end of each year all Māori authorities must complete and return the following returns to help us determine the right amount of tax has been paid. •Income tax return: Māori authorities - IR8, unless they have an exemption . This return provides a complete statement of the authority's taxable income •Annual Māori authority credit account return - IR8J •Māori authority distribution statement. What to include on the IR8J All Māori authorities maintaining a MACA must complete an end-of-year Annual Māori authority credit account return - IR8J. You must show the following information in this return: •opening balance •amount and source of all debits •amount and source of all credits •closing balance. A Māori authority must file its IR8 return by the due date for filing its income tax return for the corresponding income year. Limits on income tax refund Income tax refunds will generally be limited to the amount of the credit closing balance at the most recently ended MACA year. For example, a refund of income tax being issued 31 May 2011 will be limited to the credit balance in the MACA as at 31 March 2011. This is because some of the credits that were in the MACA have already been attached to distributions paid to members. The balance of the income tax credit that hasn't been refunded will be automatically transferred to the following financial year as a provisional tax payment. If the MACA closing balance is nil or a debit, the Māori authority will not be entitled to receive any income tax refund. Māori authority distribution statement A Māori authority that makes a distribution to a member must, at the time it makes the distribution, complete and retain a distribution statement. The distribution statement must include: •the name of the Māori authority •the name, address, and IRD number of the member who is receiving the distribution •the date the distribution is made •the total amount of distribution made •the amount of the distribution made to the member, including what portion is a taxable distribution and what portion is a non- taxable distribution •the total amount of Māori authority credits attached to the distribution or treated as being attached to the distribution (shown as a nil amount if Māori authority credits are not attached) •any more information the Commissioner may require. All Māori authorities maintaining a MACA must complete a statement advising us of the total amount of distributions of credits made to their members. If no distributions have been made, a nil statement must be completed. File this with the Income tax return: Māori authorities - IR8. Members' distribution statement All Māori authorities maintaining a MACA and making distribution to their members must provide them with a distribution statement. This tells them about distributions they receive so they can, if necessary, complete their personal tax returns. 11 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Paying further income tax If the MACA has a debit balance at 31 March the authority must make a payment, "further income tax", to clear the debit balance. The authority gets a benefit from the further income tax payment. It can be used to meet any income tax liability that they become liable for after the payment is made. Penalties that may apply Overdue further income tax If a Māori authority has a debit balance in its MACA at 31 March it will automatically incur a 10% penalty on the further income tax due - a Māori authority distribution penalty tax. This is to encourage Māori authorities to have a credit closing balance. Both further income tax and Māori authority distribution penalty tax are due by 20 June following the end of the MACA year. Late payment penalty An extra 1% late payment penalty is charged on any balance over $100 which is outstanding after 20 June, plus 4% of the amount of tax to pay at the end of the 7th day after the due date. Note If a Māori authority stops being a Māori authority and a debit balance exists, the authority must clear that debit no later than the last day on which the organisation is still a Māori authority. If this amount is not paid by the due date, late payment penalties may apply. For more information about penalties and interest, go to our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. If you receive income from a Māori authority It's important members receiving distributions from Māori authorities understand their own personal income tax responsibilities. Distributions from Māori authorities now have credits attached to them. Credits received that exceed the Māori authority member's tax liability may be refunded to the Māori authority member. However, we are entitled to use the Māori authority credits to meet any other tax payments payable by the member, for example, any tax arrears. A refund will be made where there's still a credit after all tax liabilities have been met. Distribution statements A member should also receive a distribution statement from a Māori authority. If you're a member, this information will assist you when completing your personal income tax return or when requesting a personal tax summary. IRD numbers If you're a member receiving taxable distributions from a Māori authority, make sure you give your IRD number to the Māori authority. The authority can then apply the current tax rate of 17.5% to the distribution, instead of the 39% no-notification rate that will apply if you don't supply an IRD number. RWT paid Any RWT paid on taxable Māori authority distributions should be included with total RWT paid on interest. However, it is essential to attach a note to the return to explain the source of RWT and why there was no accompanying interest income as this makes return processing more efficient. 12 MāORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES Services you may need myIR You can manage your tax and entitlements online with a myIR account.

Residential rental deductions claimed this year 3 Explanatory notes to help you complete Worksheet A When you should use Worksheet A Use this worksheet this year if: - you have not sold any residential rental property that the residential property deduction rules apply to this year; and - you did not earn net income this year from a residential property that is outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Before you start, identify which properties you have in a portfolio and which properties are individual properties. You will also need information about rent received, expenses and any excess deductions left over from property sold in a previous income year. Note - Property references A property reference could be a street address, certificate of title, Lot and DP number. Only complete the number of columns required for your situation. Residential portfolio and individual properties If you have more than 1 residential property and you are applying the rules to all your properties on a portfolio basis, do not fill out any individual property columns. You will need to combine the income and expenses of all of the properties in the portfolio in 1 column. For more information about residential portfolios and individual properties, see our guide, Rental income - IR264. Sale of a residential rental property If you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio this year, you should use Worksheet B or Worksheet C. Use the decision tree on page 1 to work out which worksheet you should use. Where the term "sale" is used in this worksheet, it is intended to cover all types of disposals. Step 1 Rental income Enter the total gross rental income you have earned in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Include all of the following in this amount: - total rents - other income (such as insurance receipts or rates refunds) - depreciation recovery income. For more information about rental income, see our guide Rental income - IR264. Step 3 Rental expenses Enter the total amount of deductible expenses you have incurred in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Enter the expenses as a positive amount. If you have a residential portfolio you will need to combine the total expenses amounts for all properties in the portfolio. Do not include excess deductions carried forward from a previous year in this step. For close companies making adjustments for loss of continuity or transfers of excess deductions you need to adjust this figure by the appropriate amount. For more information about which expenses are deductible, see our guide Rental income - IR264. Step 5 Excess residential rental deductions brought forward for a residential portfolio and individual properties Do not complete this step for the 2019-20 income year. You will have calculated this amount in the previous year as an amount to carry forward for your residential portfolio or individual properties. This amount will include any excess deductions transferred to the residential portfolio or individual property in a previous year. This amount will also include any unused excess deductions remaining after the non-taxable sale of residential property that arose in a previous income year and which were not allocated to another property in the year of the sale. For more information about transfers of excess deductions see our guide Rental income - IR264. You can use this step to transfer any unused excess deductions brought forward from a previous income year that have not yet been transferred (because you did not have a property to transfer them to). Include the unused excess deductions to be transferred in the column of the residential portfolio or individual property that you want to transfer them to. You must transfer unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale of residential property across one or more properties, until all the excess deductions are used up. Step 7 Total residential rental deductions Adding Step 3 and Step 5 together calculates the total amount of deductions for your residential portfolio and individual properties. Step 8 Net residential income or loss for a residential portfolio and individual properties Calculate the net income or net loss for your residential portfolio and individual properties by subtracting the total residential rental deductions at Step 7 from rental income at Step 1. If the deductions for your residential portfolio or individual property are more than the income you earned from the residential portfolio or individual property, the result at Step 8 is a net loss. Record a net loss as a negative amount. Step 9 Net residential income Add together only the net income from your residential portfolio and any individual properties at Step 8. Do not include any net losses from Step 8 in this calculation. This amount on this worksheet cannot be a negative amount (a loss) because there have been no taxable sales to release excess deductions. If you have no net income across your residential portfolio and any individual properties then enter 0 on your return. Step 10 Excess residential deductions carried forward for each portfolio and property When your deductions exceed residential income for a residential portfolio or individual property in an income year, the excess deductions must be carried forward to the next income year in which you earn residential income. Excess deductions from a residential portfolio or individual property can only be used against the residential income from that portfolio or property unless it is sold. For more information see our guide Rental income - IR264. If a residential portfolio or individual property has a net loss at Step 8, enter that amount here. This amount must be carried forward as excess deductions. If a residential portfolio or individual property has net income at Step 8, enter 0 here. Step 11 Total excess residential rental deductions carried forward If you have no excess deductions to carry forward, enter 0 on your return. Step 12 Residential rental deductions claimed this year for portfolio and individual properties If a residential portfolio or individual property has a net loss then the amount of deductions that may be claimed this year is limited to the amount of income earned from the residential portfolio or individual property. If a residential portfolio or individual property has net income then all deductible expenses relating to that residential portfolio or individual property may be claimed this year. Only complete the relevant columns in Steps 12a and 12b. For each portfolio and individual property, EITHER 12a or 12b can be calculated, but not both. If the property has a nil/"0" result at step 8, then leave both 12a and 12b blank. Step 13 Residential rental deductions claimed this year Add together the residential rental deductions claimed this year calculated at Step 12 for your residential portfolio and individual properties. 4 Worksheet B - Non-taxable sales, no net income from revenue account property Complete only the columns you need for your situation.

Residential rental deductions claimed this year Explanatory notes to help you complete Worksheet B When you should use Worksheet B Use this worksheet this year if: - You have sold an individual property that the residential property deduction rules apply to this year and the sale was not taxable. - You have sold the last property in a residential portfolio that the residential property deduction rules apply to this year and any of the sales were not taxable. - You did not earn net income this year from a residential property that is outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Before you start, identify which properties you have in a portfolio and which properties are individual properties. You will also need information about rent received, expenses and any excess deductions left over from property sold in a previous income year. Part 1 Residential income and deductions Note - Property references A property reference could be a street address, certificate of title, lot and DP number. Only complete the number of columns required for your situation. Residential portfolio and individual properties If you have more than 1 residential property and you are applying the rules to all your properties on a portfolio basis, do not fill out any individual property columns. You will need to combine the income and expenses of all of the properties in the portfolio in 1 column. For more information about residential portfolios and individual properties, see our guide Rental income - IR264. Sale of a residential rental property If you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio this year, you will need to use a column for the sold property or portfolio. Where the term "sale" is used in this worksheet, it is intended to cover all types of disposals. Step 1 Rental income Enter the total gross rental income you have earned in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Include all of the following in this amount: - total rents - other income (such as insurance receipts or rates refunds) - depreciation recovery income. For more information about rental income, see our guide Rental income - IR264. Step 2 Rental expenses Enter the total amount of deductible expenses you have incurred in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Enter the expenses as a positive amount. If you have a residential portfolio you will need to combine the total expenses amounts for all properties in the portfolio. Do not include in this step: - any amounts from the sale of a residential rental property. - excess deductions carried forward from a previous year. For close companies making adjustments for loss of continuity or transfers of excess deductions you need to adjust this figure by the appropriate amount. For more information about what expenses are deductible, see our guide Rental income - IR264. Step 3 Excess deductions bought forward for a residential portfolio and individual properties Do not complete this step for the 2019-20 income year. You will have calculated this amount in the previous year as an amount to carry forward for your residential portfolio or individual properties. This amount will include any excess deductions transferred to the residential portfolio or individual property in a previous year. This amount will also include any unused excess deductions remaining after the non-taxable sale of residential property that arose in a previous income year and which were not allocated to another property in the year of the sale. For more information about transfers of excess deductions see our guide Rental income - IR264. You can use this step to transfer any unused excess deductions brought forward from a previous income year that have not yet been transferred (because you did not have a property to transfer them to). Include the unused excess deductions to be transferred in the column of the residential portfolio or individual property that you want to transfer them to. Step 4 Total residential deductions Adding Step 2 and Step 3 together calculates the total amount of deductions for your residential portfolio and individual properties. Step 5 Net residential income or loss for a residential portfolio and individual properties Subtracting Step 4 from Step 1 calculates the net profit or net loss for your residential portfolio and individual properties. Part 2 Transfers of unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale of residential rental property Part 2 of this worksheet helps you: - Transfer any unused excess deductions remaining after the non-taxable sale of an individual property. - Transfer any unused deductions remaining after the sale of the last property in a residential portfolio where 1 or more of the sales of all the properties in the residential portfolio (in any year) was not taxable. Step 6, Step 6a and Step 6b Recalculate net income or net loss for a residential portfolio and individual properties You will have unused excess deductions if: - Step 5 shows a loss for an individual property that was sold and the sale was non-taxable, or - Step 5 shows a loss for a residential portfolio if the last property in the portfolio has been sold and at least 1 of the sales of a portfolio property was non-taxable. You must transfer all these unused excess deductions to another residential portfolio or individual property that the residential property deduction rules apply to. 6 If you have not sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio this year, answer N/A. If you have another property to transfer the unused excess deductions to in this year, do that at Step 6a and Step 6b. If you have no other property to transfer these excess deductions to, the excess deductions must be carried forward until you can transfer them. They will be included in your Excess deductions carried forward amount on your return. To make the transfer this year, first enter at Step 6a the amount of unused excess deductions remaining from the sale of a residential portfolio or individual property in the column for that portfolio or property. Enter this as a positive amount. Next, enter in Step 6b the amounts of unused excess deductions to be transferred to your other property or properties that you want to transfer the unused excess deductions to. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in the income year. If only one property in the portfolio has been sold, and the portfolio will continue to exist, answer No at Step 6 and continue to Step 7. You must transfer unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale of residential property across one or more properties, until all the excess deductions are used up. Step 7 Recalculated net residential income for transferred amounts Recalculate the net profit or loss for your residential portfolio and individual properties to take account of any transfers of excess deductions remaining after the non-taxable sale of an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio. The result for a property that was sold should now be 0. If no amount has been transferred to any residential portfolio or individual property, the result will be the same as the net amount from Step 5. Part 3 Totals for income tax return Part 3 of this worksheet helps you calculate the amounts that need to be entered on your income tax return for residential rental income. Step 11 Net residential income Add together only the net income from your residential portfolio and individual properties at Step 7. This amount cannot be a loss. Do not include any net losses from Step 7 in this calculation. If you have no net profits across your residential portfolio and any individual properties then enter 0. Step 12 Excess residential rental deductions carried forward for each residential portfolio and individual property When your deductions exceed rental income for a residential portfolio or individual property in an income year, the excess deductions must be carried forward to a future income year in which you earn residential income. Excess deductions that arise from a residential portfolio or individual property can only be used against the residential income from that portfolio or property unless the portfolio or property is sold. The amount calculated in this step is the excess deductions for the residential portfolio and each individual property taking into account any transfers of excess deductions after you sell a property. This amount must be carried forward as excess deductions. If any of the excess deductions are from a residential portfolio or individual properties that were sold in the current year, keep a track of these deductions and which property they relate to. This information will be needed in a later year when you sell the property. Step 13 Total excess residential rental deductions carried forward This step brings the results for each residential portfolio and individual property together. If you have no excess deductions to carry forward, enter 0 on your return. Step 14 Residential rental deductions claimed this year for each residential portfolio and individual property The amount of deductions for a residential portfolio or individual property in an income year is limited to the amount of residential income you earn in the income year from the residential portfolio or individual property. If your income is higher than the amount of your deductible expenses, then you will be able to claim all your deductions. For each residential portfolio and individual property, take the total residential deductions at Step 4. Then add the amount of any excess deductions transferred to the property at Step 6b or subtract the amount of any excess deductions transferred from the property at Step 6a. Finally, subtract the amount of any excess deductions for the property at Step 12. Step 15 Residential rental deductions claimed this year Add together the residential rental deductions claimed this year calculated for each residential portfolio and individual property you own. 7 Worksheet C - Full worksheet Complete only the columns you need for your situation.

Before you start, identify which properties you have in a portfolio and which properties are individual properties. You will also need information about rent received, expenses and any excess deductions left over from property sold in a previous income year. Part 1: Residential income and deductions Note - Property references A property reference could be a street address, certificate of title, lot and DP number. Complete only the number of columns required for your situation. Residential portfolio and individual properties If you have more than 1 residential property and you are applying the rules to all your properties on a portfolio basis, do not fill out any individual property columns. You will need to combine the income and expenses of all of the properties in the portfolio in 1 column. For more information about residential portfolios and individual properties, see our guide Rental income - IR264. If you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio this year, you will need to use a column for the sold property or portfolio. Sale of a residential rental property If you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio this year, you will need to use a column for the sold property or portfolio. Where the term "sale" is used in this worksheet, it is intended to cover all types of disposals. Step 1 Rental income Enter the total gross rental income you have earned in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties you own that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Include all of the following in this amount: - total rents - other income (such as insurance receipts or rates refunds) - depreciation recovery income. For more information about rental income, see our guide Rental income - IR264. Step 2 Net income from sale of a residential property Net income from the taxable sale of one or more residential rental properties in a residential portfolio is included in the residential income of that portfolio. Net income from the taxable sale of an individual property is included in the residential income of that property. Do not include at this step net income from residential rental properties that are excluded from the residential property deduction rules or that are on revenue account. If you had a net loss from the taxable sale of a residential property, then enter zero for that property. For more information about exclusions from the rules and revenue account property, see our guide Rental income - IR264. Step 3 Rental property income This step calculates the total rental property income for your residential portfolio and individual properties. Include net income from a taxable sale here. Step 4 Rental expenses Enter the total amount of deductible expenses you have incurred this income year for a residential portfolio and individual properties you own. Enter the expenses as a positive amount. If you have a residential portfolio you will need to combine the total expenses amounts for each property in the portfolio. Do not include in this step: - any expenditure or loss from the sale of a residential rental property. - excess deductions carried forward from a previous year. For close companies making adjustments for loss of continuity or group company transfers of excess deductions you need to adjust this figure by the appropriate amount. For more information about what expenses are deductible, see our guide Rental income - IR264. Step 5 Excess deductions brought forward for a residential portfolio and individual properties Do not complete this step for the 2019-20 income year. You will have calculated this amount in the previous year as an amount to carry forward for a residential portfolio or individual property. This amount will include any excess deductions transferred to the residential portfolio or individual property in a previous year. This amount will also include any unused excess deductions remaining after the non-taxable sale of residential property that arose in a previous income year and which were not allocated to another property in the year of the sale. For more information about transfers of excess deductions see our guide Rental income - IR264. You can also use this step to transfer any unused excess deductions brought forward from a previous income year that have not yet been transferred (because you did not have a property to transfer them to). Include the unused excess deductions to be transferred in the column of the residential portfolio or individual property that you want to transfer them to. You must transfer unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale of residential property across one or more properties, until all the excess deductions are used up. Step 6 Total residential rental deductions Adding together rental expenses and excess deductions brought forward calculates the total amount of deductions for your residential portfolio and individual properties. Step 7 Net income for each portfolio and property Calculate net income or net loss for your residential portfolio and individual properties by subtracting the total residential rental deductions from rental property income. 11 Step 8 Net income from revenue account property You can offset excess deductions from a residential portfolio or individual property against net income from a residential property that is outside the residential property deduction rules because it will be taxed on sale (revenue account property). Revenue account property is a property that is part of a business in developing, dealing in, or building residential property that is not a business premises or it is property that you have notified us will be taxable on sale regardless of when it is sold. The income from revenue account property that is required to be entered at this row does not relate to your residential portfolios or individual properties entered in this worksheet. It relates to any other revenue account property, if you have any. Enter net income from taxable sales, net rental income, and any depreciation recovery income from properties excluded from the residential property deduction rules because they are on revenue account. Do not include income from properties that are otherwise excluded, such as your main home or a holiday home taxed under the mixed asset rules. If you do not have revenue account property income, or if your revenue account property has made a loss, enter 0 here. For more information about residential rental properties on revenue account, see our guide Rental income - IR264. Step 9 Allocate revenue account property income You can offset losses from a residential portfolio or individual property against net income from revenue account property (revenue account property income). You must allocate all net income from revenue account property to one or more of your residential portfolio or individual properties. It is your choice as to how you allocate the income. You do not need to allocate it equally across all your portfolio/properties. If you did not have any net income from revenue account property at Step 8, enter 0 here. Step 10 Adjust residential income for revenue account property income Add any amounts of net income from revenue account property you have allocated to the rental property income at Step 3 for your residential portfolio and individual properties. If you do not have any net income from revenue account property, enter the amounts from Step 3 here. Step 11 Recalculated net position If you have net income from revenue account property, you will need to recalculate the net position for the properties you allocated that income to. If you did not allocate any revenue account property income to a residential portfolio or individual property, then this figure will be the same as that at Step 7. Step 13 Sales of residential rental property If you have sold one or more individual properties or a residential portfolio, you will need to work out if any excess deductions need to be transferred. Part 2 will help you do this. If the only property you have sold was in a residential portfolio that continues to exist (ie, you did not sell the last property in the portfolio), answer No here. If you answered No for all portfolios and individual properties that you own, go to Step 22. Part 2 Transfers of remaining unused deductions from the sale of an individual property or the sale of the last property in a portfolio Complete Part 2 if you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio in this income year. This Part helps you work out if any excess deductions are required to be transferred from the sale of the property or residential portfolio to another property or portfolio. Step 15 Total excess deductions transferred to a residential portfolio or individual property in previous years This step must be completed for your residential portfolio and individual properties for which you answered Yes at Step 14. If no excess deductions have been transferred to the individual property or residential portfolio in any income year, enter 0 here. Record all excess deductions that have been transferred to the residential portfolio or individual property in any income year. You must keep track of amounts transferred from one property to another because these amounts may affect the amount of deductions you can claim on the sale of the property when the sale is taxable. Transfers of excess deductions made in this year are recorded at Step 15b and Step 15c. For more information about transferred unused excess deductions, see our guide Rental income - IR264. Step 15a Unused excess deductions to be transferred Step 15a must be completed for your residential portfolio and individual properties for which you answered Yes at Step 14. If a property shows a net loss at Step 11, and it had deductions transferred to it (which is shown at Step 15), compare the amounts at Step 11 and Step 15, and treating them as both positive amounts, enter the smaller amount at Step 15a. This step calculates the unused excess deductions to transfer in the current year or to carry forward for each portfolio or property that was sold in the income year where the sale was taxable. Excess deductions that would otherwise be released on a taxable sale must be reduced by the amount of any unused excess deductions transferred to the property. If the net loss at Step 11 is smaller than the amount entered at Step 15a, then the whole of the loss cannot be released and must be transferred. Step 15b and Step 15c Transfer unused excess deductions from a taxable sale You will have unused excess deductions remaining from a taxable sale of an individual property if the property has a loss at Step 11 and excess deductions were previously transferred to the individual property. You will have unused excess deductions remaining from the sale of the last property in a residential portfolio if the property has a loss at Step 11, the sales of all properties in the portfolio were taxable, and excess deductions were previously transferred to the individual property. If you have another property or portfolio to transfer the unused excess deductions to in this year, you can transfer any unused excess deductions from a taxable sale to another property at Step 15b and Step 15c. If you have no other property to transfer these excess deductions to, these excess deductions must be carried forward until you can transfer them. They will be included in your Excess deductions carried forward amount at Step 21. To make the transfer this year, first enter at Step 15b the amount of unused excess deductions remaining from the sale of a portfolio or property in the column for that portfolio or property. Next, enter in Step 15c the amounts of unused excess deductions to be transferred to your other property or properties that you want to transfer the unused excess deductions to. You can transfer unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale of residential property across multiple properties, until all the excess deductions are used up. 12 Step 16 Non-taxable sales If you had a mix of taxable and non-taxable sales of all the properties in a residential portfolio, answer No here for the portfolio. This question requires you to look at all sales of portfolio properties for the current year and all previous years. If one or more properties are not taxable on sale, any excess deductions remaining after the sale of the last property in a portfolio must be transferred to another residential portfolio or property. For more information see our guide Rental income - IR264. Step 17, Step 17a and Step 17b Transfer unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in this income year. If the last property in the portfolio has not been sold, and the portfolio will continue to exist, answer No for the portfolio at Step 17. You will have unused excess deductions remaining if you answered Yes at Step 16 because: - Step 11 shows a loss for an individual property that was sold and the sale was non-taxable, or - Step 6 shows a loss for a residential portfolio if the last property in the portfolio has been sold and at least 1 of the sales of a portfolio property (in any year) was non-taxable. You must transfer all these unused excess deductions to another residential portfolio or individual property if you have one and have earned residential income in this income year. If you have another property to transfer the unused excess deductions to in this year, make the transfer at Step 17a and Step 17b. If you answered Yes for an individual property or residential portfolio at Step 17, enter the amount of the net loss for the property from Step 11 in Step 17a. Allocate all of the amount in Step 17a to one or more properties in Step 17b. If you have no other property to transfer these excess deductions to, or you have not earned any residential income in this income year, you will need to carry these excess deductions forward. They will be included in your Excess deductions carried forward amount on your return. The excess deductions will be reinstated in the next income year in which you earn residential income from a residential portfolio or individual property. You will need to keep track of this amount for future income years. First, enter at Step 17a the amount of unused excess deductions remaining from the sale of a portfolio or property in the column for that portfolio or property. Next, enter in Step 17b the amounts of unused excess deductions to be transferred to your other property or properties that you want to transfer the unused excess deductions to. You can transfer unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale of residential property across multiple properties, until all the excess deductions are used up. Step 18 Recalculated net position for transferred amounts Recalculate net profit or loss for your residential portfolio and individual properties to take account of any transfers of excess deductions remaining after the sale of an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio. Remember that a net loss is a negative amount. If you did not make any transfers to or from a residential portfolio or individual property at Step 15 or Step 17, enter the amount from Step 11 here. Part 3 Calculating excess deductions for a residential portfolio and individual properties This section is comprised of four subparts. For your residential portfolio and individual properties only complete the subpart that applies to your circumstances: Part 3A, Part 3B, Part 3C or Part 3D. Each section will help you to calculate your net residential income, excess deductions and deductions claimed for your residential portfolio and individual properties. Complete Part 3A for an individual property or residential portfolio if: - the individual property was not sold this year AND you have transferred excess deductions to it in Part 2. - the last property in the residential portfolio was not sold this year AND you have transferred excess deductions to the residential portfolio in Part 2. Complete Part 3B for an individual property or residential portfolio if: - the individual property was sold this year and the sale was not taxable. - the last property in the portfolio was sold this year and one or more of the sales of all of the properties in the portfolio was not taxable. Complete Part 3C for an individual property or residential portfolio if: - the individual property was sold this year and the sale was taxable. - the last property in the portfolio was sold this year and ALL of the sales of the properties in the portfolio were taxable. Complete Part 3D for an individual property or residential portfolio if any of the following are true: - the individual property was not sold AND you have not transferred excess deductions to it in Part 2. - the last property in the residential portfolio was not sold this year AND you have not transferred excess deductions to the residential portfolio in Part 2. - did not sell any properties in this year. - None of your properties showed a net loss at Step 11 (and you answered No to all at Step 12). Part 3A Individual property or last property in a portfolio not sold and has excess deductions transferred to it Complete this section for an individual property or residential portfolio that has not been sold this year but that has had unused excess deductions transferred to it from the sale of another residential portfolio or individual property in this income year at Step 15c or Step 17b. Step 19 No sale of the individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio AND transferred excess deductions If you transferred unused excess deductions this year to a residential portfolio or individual property you have not sold, the transferred deductions will affect your net profit or loss at Step 11. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in this income year. This step calculates the excess deductions that must be carried forward for your residential portfolio or individual properties that were not sold in the income year and to which transfers of excess deductions were made. When your deductions exceed residential income for a residential portfolio or individual property in an income year, the excess deductions must be carried forward to a future income year in which you earn residential income. Excess deductions that arise from a residential portfolio or individual property can only be used against the residential income from that portfolio or property unless the property is sold. Step 19a Residential rental deductions claimed this year This step calculates the deductions that can be claimed this year for your residential portfolio or individual properties that were not sold in the income year and to which transfers of excess deductions were made. If a residential portfolio or individual property has a net loss then the amount of deductions that may be claimed this year is limited to the amount of income earned from the residential portfolio or individual property. If a residential portfolio or individual property has net income then all deductible expenses relating to that residential portfolio or individual property may be claimed this year. 13 Step 19b Net residential income This step calculates the final net position for your residential portfolio and individual properties that were not sold in the income year and to which transfers of excess deductions were made. Part 3B Non-Taxable sales Complete this section for your residential portfolio and individual properties for which you answered Yes at Step 16. Step 20 Excess residential rental deductions to carry forward This step calculates the excess deductions that must be carried forward for your individual property that was sold in the income year where the sale was not taxable. This step calculates the excess deductions that must be carried forward for your residential portfolio that was sold in the income year where at least one sale of all the properties in the portfolio in any income year was not taxable. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in the income year. When your deductions exceed residential income for a residential portfolio or individual property in an income year, the excess deductions must be carried forward to a future income year in which you earn residential income. Excess deductions that arise from a residential portfolio or individual property can only be used against the residential income from that portfolio or property unless the property is sold. Step 20a Deductions claimed this year This step calculates the excess deductions that must be carried forward for your individual property that was sold in the income year where the sale was not taxable. This step calculates the excess deductions that must be carried forward for your residential portfolio that was sold in the income year where at least one sale of all the properties in the portfolio in any income year was not taxable. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in the income year. Calculate your deductions claimed this year by starting with your total deductions at Step 6. If you transferred any excess deductions from this property to one or more other properties at Step 15b or Step 17a, subtract the amounts transferred from your total deductions. If you transferred any excess deductions from another property to this property at Step 15c or Step 17b, then add the amounts transferred to your total deductions. Finally, subtract the amount of excess deductions to carry forward as calculated at Step 20. The amount of deductions for a residential rental property in an income year is limited to the amount of residential income you earn in the income year for the property. If your residential income is higher than the amount of deductible expenses you have incurred for the property, then you will be able to claim all your deductions. Step 20b Net residential income This step calculates the final net position of your residential portfolio and individual properties that this subpart applies to. Part 3C Taxable sales Complete this section for your residential portfolio and individual properties for which you answered Yes at Step 14. Step 21a Residential rental deductions claimed this year This step calculates the deductions that can be claimed this year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that were sold in the income year where the sales were all taxable. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in the income year. If the sale was taxable, you can claim all your deductions for the property minus any transferred amounts. Step 21b Net residential income This step calculates the final net position of your residential portfolio and individual properties that were sold in the income year where: - for a residential portfolio, the last property in the portfolio was sold and the sales of all the properties in the portfolio were taxable - for an individual property, the sale was taxable. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in the income year. This step also takes into account any unused excess deductions remaining after the taxable sale of an individual property or residential portfolio at Step 21. Unused excess deductions that remain after a taxable sale will relate to transfers made in previous years to the property from non-taxable sales. Part 3D No sales of individual property or last property in a residential portfolio and no transferred excess deductions or no net loss at step 11. Complete this section for each individual property that you did not sell in this income year and that you did not transfer any unused excess deductions to at Step 15c or Step 17b. Complete this section for a residential portfolio if you did not sell the last property in the residential portfolio and you did not transfer any unused excess deductions to it at Step 15c or Step 17b. Complete this section if you sold a property in a residential portfolio that will continue to exist (ie, you did not sell the last property in the residential portfolio) and you did not transfer any unused excess deductions to the portfolio at Step 15c or Step 17b. Complete this section if you answered No at Step 13 because you did not sell any residential property this year. Complete this section if you answered No to all at Step 12 because none of your properties had a net loss this year. Step 22 Excess residential deductions to carry forward This step calculates the excess deductions that must be carried forward for your residential portfolio and individual properties that were not sold in the income year and to which no transfers of excess deductions were made. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in the income year. When your deductions exceed residential income for a residential portfolio or individual property in an income year, the excess deductions must be carried forward to a future income year in which you earn residential income. Excess deductions that arise from a residential portfolio or individual property can only be used against the residential income from that portfolio or property unless the property is sold. Step 22a Residential rental deductions claimed this year for each portfolio and property This step calculates the deductions that can be claimed this year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that were not sold in the income year and to which no transfers of excess deductions were made. If a residential portfolio or individual property has a net loss then the amount of deductions that may be claimed this year is limited to the amount of residential income for the residential portfolio or individual property. If a residential portfolio or individual property has net income then all deductible expenses relating to that residential portfolio or individual property may be claimed this year. 14 Step 22b Net residential income This step calculates the final net position of your residential portfolio and individual properties that were not sold in the income year and to which no transfers of excess deductions were made. Part 4 Totals for income tax return This section must be completed for your residential portfolio and all individual properties that you own. The totals in this section must be entered in the relevant boxes on your income tax return. Step 26 Deductions claimed this year Add together the residential rental deductions claimed this year calculated for your residential portfolio and individual properties. To do this, first add together all the amounts at each of the Steps listed in Step 26. For example, if you calculated the residential rental deductions for more than one property at Step 22a, add together the deductions claimed this year at Step 22a for all those properties before performing the calculation at Step 26. Step 27 Net residential income Add together only the net residential income amounts for each residential portfolio and individual property you own. To do this, first add together all the amounts at each of the Steps listed in Step 27. For example, if you calculated the net residential income for more than one property at Step 22b, add together the net residential incomes at Step 22b for all those properties before performing the calculation at Step 27. This total amount may be a loss if you have a net loss from the taxable sale of individual property, or the last property in a residential portfolio has been sold, and the sales of each property in the portfolio were taxable. Step 28 Total excess residential rental deductions to carry forward This step brings the results for each residential portfolio and individual property together. To do this, first add together all the amounts at each of the Steps listed in Step 25. For example, if you calculated the excess residential rental deductions carried forward for more than one property at Step 22, add together the excess deductions to carry forward at Step 22 for all those properties before performing the calculation at Step 25. If you have no excess deductions to carry forward, enter 0 on your return.

Read part 4 of our Rental income - IR264 guide for more information. Property references A property reference could be a street address, certificate of title, Lot and DP number. Only complete the number of columns required for your situation. Residential portfolio and individual properties If you have more than 1 residential property and you are applying the rules to all your properties on a portfolio basis, do not fill out any individual property columns. You will need to combine the income and expenses of all of the properties in the portfolio in 1 column. Sale of a residential rental property If you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio this year, you should use Worksheet B or Worksheet C. Use the decision tree on page 1 to work out which worksheet you should use. Where the term "sale" is used in this worksheet, it is intended to cover all types of disposals. Step 1 Rental income Enter the total gross rental income you have earned in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Include all of the following in this amount: • total rents • other income (such as insurance receipts or rates refunds) Step 3 Other residential income Enter the total other residential income you have earned in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Include the following: • income in relation to a loan denominated in a foreign currency • all depreciation recovery income from assets disposed. Step 7 Rental expenses Enter the total amount of deductible expenses you have incurred in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Enter the expenses as a positive amount. If you have a residential portfolio you will need to combine the total expenses amounts for all properties in the portfolio. Do not include excess deductions carried forward from a previous year in this step. For close companies making adjustments for loss of continuity or transfers of excess deductions you need to adjust this figure by the appropriate amount. Step 8 Excess residential rental deductions brought forward for a residential portfolio and individual properties You will have calculated this amount in the previous year as an amount to carry forward for your residential portfolio or individual properties. This amount will include any excess deductions transferred to the residential portfolio or individual property in a previous year. This amount will also include any unused excess deductions remaining after the non-taxable sale of residential property that arose in a previous income year and which were not allocated to another property in the year of the sale. You can use this step to transfer any unused excess deductions brought forward from a previous income year that have not yet been transferred (because you did not have a property to transfer them to). Include the unused excess deductions to be transferred in the column of the residential portfolio or individual property that you want to transfer them to. You must transfer unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale of residential property across one or more properties, until all the excess deductions are used up. Step 11 Total residential rental deductions Adding Step 7 and Step 9 together calculates the total amount of deductions for your residential portfolio and individual properties. 4 Step 12 Net residential income or loss for a residential portfolio and individual properties Calculate the net income or net loss for your residential portfolio and individual properties by subtracting the total residential rental deductions at Step 11 from rental income at Step 5. If the deductions for your residential portfolio or individual property are more than the income you earned from the residential portfolio or individual property, the result at Step 12 is a net loss. Record a net loss as a negative amount. Step 13 Net residential income Add together only the net income from your residential portfolio and any individual properties at Step 12. Do not include any net losses from Step 12 in this calculation. This amount on this worksheet cannot be a negative amount (a loss) because there have been no taxable sales to release excess deductions. If you have no net income across your residential portfolio and any individual properties then enter 0 on your return. Step 14 Excess residential deductions carried forward for each portfolio and property When your deductions exceed residential income for a residential portfolio or individual property in an income year, the excess deductions must be carried forward to the next income year in which you earn residential income. Excess deductions from a residential portfolio or individual property can only be used against the residential income from that portfolio or property unless it is sold. If a residential portfolio or individual property has a net loss at Step 12, enter that amount here. This amount must be carried forward as excess deductions. If a residential portfolio or individual property has net income at Step 12, enter 0 here. Step 15 Total excess residential rental deductions carried forward If you have no excess deductions to carry forward, enter 0 on your return. Step 16 Residential rental deductions claimed this year for portfolio and individual properties If a residential portfolio or individual property has a net loss then the amount of deductions that may be claimed this year is limited to the amount of income earned from the residential portfolio or individual property. If a residential portfolio or individual property has net income then all deductible expenses relating to that residential portfolio or individual property may be claimed this year. Only complete the relevant columns in Steps 16a and 16b. For each portfolio and individual property, EITHER 16a or 16b can be calculated, but not both. If the property has a nil/"0" result at step12, then leave both 16a and 16b blank. Step 17 Residential rental deductions claimed this year Add together the residential rental deductions claimed this year calculated at Step 16 for your residential portfolio and individual properties. 5 Worksheet B - Non-taxable sales, no net income from revenue account property When you should use Worksheet B Use this worksheet this year if: - You have sold an individual property that the residential property deduction rules apply to this year and the sale was not taxable. - You have sold the last property in a residential portfolio that the residential property deduction rules apply to this year and any of the sales were not taxable. - You did not earn net income this year from a residential property that is outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Before you start, identify which properties you have in a portfolio and which properties are individual properties. You will also need information about rent received, expenses and any excess deductions left over from property sold in a previous income year. Complete only the columns you need for your situation. For example, if you only have one individual property or a residential portfolio, complete the first column only.

Only complete the number of columns required for your situation. Residential portfolio and individual properties If you have more than 1 residential property and you are applying the rules to all your properties on a portfolio basis, do not fill out any individual property columns. You will need to combine the income and expenses of all of the properties in the portfolio in 1 column. Sale of a residential rental property If you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio this year, you will need to use a column for the sold property or portfolio. Where the term "sale" is used in this worksheet, it is intended to cover all types of disposals. Step 1 Rental income Enter the total gross rental income you have earned in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Include all of the following in this amount: - total rents - other income (such as insurance receipts or rates refunds) For more information about rental income, see our guide Rental income - IR264. Step 2 Other residential income Enter the total other residential income you have earned in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Include all of the following: • income in relation to a loan denominated in a foreign currency • all depreciation recovery income from assets disposed Step 4 Rental expenses Enter the total amount of deductible expenses you have incurred in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Enter the expenses as a positive amount. If you have a residential portfolio you will need to combine the total expenses amounts for all properties in the portfolio. Do not include in this step: - any amounts from the sale of a residential rental property. - excess deductions carried forward from a previous year. For close companies making adjustments for loss of continuity or transfers of excess deductions you need to adjust this figure by the appropriate amount. 7 Step 5 Excess deductions bought forward for a residential portfolio and individual properties You will have calculated this amount in the previous year as an amount to carry forward for your residential portfolio or individual properties. This amount will include any excess deductions transferred to the residential portfolio or individual property in a previous year. This amount will also include any unused excess deductions remaining after the non-taxable sale of residential property that arose in a previous income year and which were not allocated to another property in the year of the sale. You can use this step to transfer any unused excess deductions brought forward from a previous income year that have not yet been transferred (because you did not have a property to transfer them to). Include the unused excess deductions to be transferred in the column of the residential portfolio or individual property that you want to transfer them to. Step 6 Total residential deductions Adding Step 4 and Step 5 together calculates the total amount of deductions for your residential portfolio and individual properties. Step 7 Net residential income or loss for a residential portfolio and individual properties Subtracting Step 6 from Step 3 calculates the net profit or net loss for your residential portfolio and individual properties. Part 2 Transfers of unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale of residential rental property Part 2 of this worksheet helps you: - Transfer any unused excess deductions remaining after the non-taxable sale of an individual property. - Transfer any unused deductions remaining after the sale of the last property in a residential portfolio where 1 or more of the sales of all the properties in the residential portfolio (in any year) was not taxable. Step 8, Step 8a and Step 8b Recalculate net income or net loss for a residential portfolio and individual properties You will have unused excess deductions if: - Step 7 shows a loss for an individual property that was sold and the sale was non-taxable, or - Step 7 shows a loss for a residential portfolio if the last property in the portfolio has been sold and at least 1 of the sales of a portfolio property was non-taxable. You must transfer all these unused excess deductions to another residential portfolio or individual property that the residential property deduction rules apply to. If you have not sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio this year, answer N/A. If you have another property to transfer the unused excess deductions to in this year, do that at Step 8a and Step 8b. If you have no other property to transfer these excess deductions to, the excess deductions must be carried forward until you can transfer them. They will be included in your Excess deductions carried forward amount on your return. To make the transfer this year, first enter at Step 8a the amount of unused excess deductions remaining from the sale of a residential portfolio or individual property in the column for that portfolio or property. Enter this as a positive amount. Next, enter in Step 8b the amounts of unused excess deductions to be transferred to your other property or properties that you want to transfer the unused excess deductions to. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in the income year. If only one property in the portfolio has been sold, and the portfolio will continue to exist, answer No at Step 8 and continue to Step 9. You must transfer unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale of residential property across one or more properties, until all the excess deductions are used up. Step 9 Recalculated net residential income after transferred amounts Recalculate the net profit or loss for your residential portfolio and individual properties to take account of any transfers of excess deductions remaining after the non-taxable sale of an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio. The result for a property that was sold should now be 0. If no amount has been transferred to any residential portfolio or individual property, the result will be the same as the net amount from Step 7. Part 3 Totals for income tax return Part 3 of this worksheet helps you calculate the amounts that need to be entered on your income tax return for residential rental income. Step 15 Net residential income Add together only the net income from your residential portfolio and individual properties at Step 9. This amount cannot be a loss. Do not include any net losses from Step 9 in this calculation. If you have no net profits across your residential portfolio and any individual properties then enter 0. Step 16 Excess residential rental deductions carried forward for each residential portfolio and individual property When your deductions exceed rental income for a residential portfolio or individual property in an income year, the excess deductions must be carried forward to a future income year in which you earn residential income. Excess deductions that arise from a residential portfolio or individual property can only be used against the residential income from that portfolio or property unless the portfolio or property is sold. The amount calculated in this step is the excess deductions for the residential portfolio and each individual property taking into account any transfers of excess deductions after you sell a property. This amount must be carried forward as excess deductions. If any of the excess deductions are from a residential portfolio or individual properties that were sold in the current year, keep a track of these deductions and which property they relate to. This information will be needed in a later year when you sell the property. Step 17 Total excess residential rental deductions carried forward This step brings the results for each residential portfolio and individual property together. If you have no excess deductions to carry forward, enter 0 on your return. Step 18 Residential rental deductions claimed this year for each residential portfolio and individual property The amount of deductions for a residential portfolio or individual property in an income year is limited to the amount of residential income you earn in the income year from the residential portfolio or individual property. If your income is higher than the amount of your deductible expenses, then you will be able to claim all your deductions. For each residential portfolio and individual property, take the total residential deductions at Step 6. Then add the amount of any excess deductions transferred to the property at Step 8b or subtract the amount of any excess deductions transferred from the property at Step 8a. Finally, subtract the amount of any excess deductions for the property at Step 16. Step 19 Residential rental deductions claimed this year Add together the residential rental deductions claimed this year calculated for each residential portfolio and individual property you own. 8 Worksheet C - Full worksheet Use this worksheet if: - You have sold an individual property this year and the sale was taxable. - You have sold the last property in a residential portfolio this year and the sale was taxable. - You have sold a property in a residential portfolio this year (which was not the last property in the portfolio) and the sale was taxable. - You have net income from a residential rental property that is held on revenue account.

Total excess residential rental deductions carried forward Explanatory notes to help you complete Worksheet C Part 1: Residential income and deductions Note Use the following notes to help you complete this worksheet. Read Part 4 of our Rental income - IR264 guide for more information Property references A property reference could be a street address, certificate of title, lot and DP number. Complete only the number of columns required for your situation. Residential portfolio and individual properties If you have more than 1 residential property and you are applying the rules to all your properties on a portfolio basis, do not fill out any individual property columns. You will need to combine the income and expenses of all of the properties in the portfolio in 1 column. If you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio this year, you will need to use a column for the sold property or portfolio. Sale of a residential rental property If you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio this year, you will need to use a column for the sold property or portfolio. Where the term "sale" is used in this worksheet, it is intended to cover all types of disposals. Step 1 Rental income Enter the total gross rental income you have earned in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties you own that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Include all of the following in this amount: - total rents - other income (such as insurance receipts or rates refunds) Step 2 Net bright-line profit (excluding losses) for a residential portfolio or individual properties Net bright-line income from the taxable sale of one or more residential rental properties in a residential portfolio is included in the residential income of that portfolio. Net bright-line income from the taxable sale of an individual property is included in the residential income of that property. Do not include any net bright-line losses. Instead keep your own record of all bright-line losses you have made. Do not include net income from residential rental properties that are not taxed under the bright-line property rule in this step. Step 3 Other residential income Enter the total other residential income you have earned in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Include all of the following: • income in relation to a loan denominated in a foreign currency • all depreciation recovery income from assets disposed Do not include net income from a residential rental property that is excluded from the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account at this step. Instead include the amount in Step 9. Residential property that is outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account is property that: • you have notified us will be taxable on sale and you are able to separately identify the deductions relating to the land. • is taxable on sale because it's held in a business of developing, dealing in, subdividing or building residential property. You will find more information about the notification requirements for residential rental property on revenue account in Part 4 of the Rental income - IR264 guide. If you had a net loss from the taxable sale of a residential property, then enter zero for that property. Step 5 Rental expenses Enter the total amount of deductible expenses you have incurred this income year for a residential portfolio and individual properties you own. Enter the expenses as a positive amount. If you have a residential portfolio you will need to combine the total expenses amounts for each property in the portfolio. Do not include in this step: - any expenditure or loss from the sale of a residential rental property. - excess deductions carried forward from a previous year. For close companies making adjustments for loss of continuity or group company transfers of excess deductions you need to adjust this figure by the appropriate amount. 12 Step 6 Excess deductions brought forward for a residential portfolio and individual properties You will have calculated this amount in the previous year as an amount to carry forward for a residential portfolio or individual property. This amount will include any excess deductions transferred to the residential portfolio or individual property in a previous year. This amount will also include any unused excess deductions remaining after the non-taxable sale of residential property that arose in a previous income year and which were not allocated to another property in the year of the sale. You can also use this step to transfer any unused excess deductions brought forward from a previous income year that have not yet been transferred (because you did not have a property to transfer them to). Include the unused excess deductions to be transferred in the column of the residential portfolio or individual property that you want to transfer them to. You must transfer unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale of residential property across one or more properties, until all the excess deductions are used up. Step 7 Total residential rental deductions Adding together rental expenses and excess deductions brought forward calculates the total amount of deductions for your residential portfolio and individual properties. Step 8 Net income for each portfolio and property Calculate net income or net loss for your residential portfolio and individual properties by subtracting the total residential rental deductions from rental property income. Step 9 Net income from revenue account property You can offset excess deductions from a residential portfolio or individual property against net income from a residential property that is outside the residential property deduction rules because it will be taxed on sale (revenue account property). Revenue account property is a property that is part of a business in developing, dealing in, or building residential property that is not a business premises or it is property that you have notified us will be taxable on sale regardless of when it is sold. The exclusion from the residential property deduction rules is generally only available if certain requirements are met. Refer to Step 3. The income from revenue account property that is required to be entered at this row does not relate to your residential portfolios or individual properties entered in this worksheet. It relates to any other revenue account property, if you have any. Enter net income from taxable sales, net rental income, and any depreciation recovery income from properties excluded from the residential property deduction rules because they are on revenue account. Do not include income from properties that are otherwise excluded, such as your main home or a holiday home taxed under the mixed asset rules. If you do not have revenue account property income, or if your revenue account property has made a loss, enter 0 here. Step 10 Allocate revenue account property income You can offset losses from a residential portfolio or individual property against net income from revenue account property (revenue account property income). You must allocate all net income from revenue account property to one or more of your residential portfolio or individual properties. It is your choice as to how you allocate the income. You do not need to allocate it equally across all your portfolio/properties. If you did not have any net income from revenue account property at Step 9, enter 0 here. Step 13 Recalculated net position If you have net income from revenue account property, you will need to recalculate the net position for the properties you allocated that income to. If you did not allocate any revenue account property income to a residential portfolio or individual property, then this figure will be the same as that at Step 8. Step 15 Sales of residential rental property If you have sold one or more individual properties or a residential portfolio, you will need to work out if any excess deductions need to be transferred. Part 2 will help you do this. If the only property you have sold was in a residential portfolio that continues to exist (ie, you did not sell the last property in the portfolio), answer No here. If you answered No for all portfolios and individual properties that you own, go to Step 24. Part 2 Transfers of remaining unused deductions from the sale of an individual property or the sale of the last property in a portfolio Complete Part 2 if you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio in this income year. This Part helps you work out if any excess deductions are required to be transferred from the sale of the property or residential portfolio to another property or portfolio. Step 17 Total excess deductions transferred to a residential portfolio or individual property This step must be completed if: • in this year, you have sold your individual property and the sale is taxable, or you have sold the last property in your residential portfolio, and the sale of all properties in the portfolio were taxable (this is the property or portfolio that you answered Yes at Step 16); and • the property or portfolio sold this year had excess deductions transferred to it from another property that was sold in previous years and that sale was not taxable; and • the property or portfolio sold this year has a loss at Step 13. If no excess deductions have been transferred to the individual property or residential portfolio in any income year, enter 0 here. Record all excess deductions that have been transferred to the residential portfolio or individual property in any income year. You must keep track of amounts transferred from one property to another because these amounts may affect the amount of deductions you can claim on the sale of the property when the sale is taxable. Transfers of excess deductions made in this year are recorded at Step 17b and Step 17c. Step 17a Unused excess deductions to be transferred Step 17a must be completed for your residential portfolio and individual properties for which you answered Yes at Step 16. If a property shows a net loss at Step 13, and it had deductions transferred to it (which is shown at Step 17), compare the amounts at Step 13 and Step 17, and treating them as both positive amounts, enter the lesser amount at Step 17a. This step calculates the unused excess deductions to transfer in the current year or to carry forward for each portfolio or property that was sold in the income year where the sale was taxable. Excess deductions that would otherwise be released on a taxable sale must be reduced by the amount of any unused excess deductions transferred to the property. 13 Step 17b and Step 17c Transfer unused excess deductions from a taxable sale You will have unused excess deductions remaining from a taxable sale of an individual property if the property has a loss at Step 13 and excess deductions were previously transferred to the individual property. You will have unused excess deductions remaining from the sale of the last property in a residential portfolio if the property has a loss at Step 13, the sales of all properties in the portfolio were taxable, and excess deductions were previously transferred to the residential portfolio. If you have another property or portfolio to transfer the unused excess deductions to in this year, you can transfer any unused excess deductions from a taxable sale to another property at Step 17b and Step 17c. If you have no other property to transfer these excess deductions to, enter 0 in Step 17b and Step 17c. These excess deductions must be carried forward until you can transfer them. They will be included in your Excess deductions carried forward amount at Step 23. To make the transfer this year, first enter at Step 17b the amount of unused excess deductions remaining from the sale of a portfolio or property in the column for that portfolio or property. Next, enter in Step 17c the amounts of unused excess deductions to be transferred to your other property or properties that you want to transfer the unused excess deductions to. You can transfer unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale of residential property across multiple properties, until all the excess deductions are used up. Step 18 Non-taxable sales If you had a mix of taxable and non-taxable sales of all the properties in a residential portfolio, answer No here for the portfolio. This question requires you to look at all sales of portfolio properties for the current year and all previous years. If one or more properties are not taxable on sale, any excess deductions remaining after the sale of the last property in a portfolio must be transferred to another residential portfolio or property. Step 19, Step 19a and Step 19b Transfer unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in this income year. If the last property in the portfolio has not been sold, and the portfolio will continue to exist, answer No for the portfolio at Step 19. You will have unused excess deductions remaining if you answered Yes at Step 18 because: - Step 13 shows a loss for an individual property that was sold and the sale was non-taxable, or - Step 13 shows a loss for a residential portfolio if the last property in the portfolio has been sold and at least 1 of the sales of a portfolio property (in any year) was non-taxable. You must transfer all these unused excess deductions to another residential portfolio or individual property if you have one and have earned residential income in this income year. If you have another property to transfer the unused excess deductions to in this year, make the transfer at Step 19a and Step 19b. If you answered Yes for an individual property or residential portfolio at Step 19, enter the amount of the net loss for the property from Step 13 in Step 19a. Allocate all of the amount in Step 19a to one or more properties in Step 19b. If you have no other property to transfer these excess deductions to, or you have not earned any residential income in this income year, enter 0 in Step 19a and Step 19b. You will need to carry these excess deductions forward. They will be included in your Excess deductions carried forward amount on your return. The excess deductions will be reinstated in the next income year in which you earn residential income from a residential portfolio or individual property. You will need to keep track of this amount for future income years. You can transfer unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale of residential property across multiple properties, until all the excess deductions are used up. Step 20 Recalculated net position for transferred amounts Recalculate net profit or loss for your residential portfolio and individual properties to take account of any transfers of excess deductions remaining after the sale of an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio. Remember that a net loss is a negative amount. If you did not make any transfers to or from a residential portfolio or individual property at Step 17 or Step 19, enter the amount from Step 13 here. Part 3 Calculating excess deductions for a residential portfolio and individual properties This section is comprised of four subparts. For your residential portfolio and individual properties only complete the subpart that applies to your circumstances: Part 3A, Part 3B, Part 3C or Part 3D. Each section will help you to calculate your net residential income, excess deductions and deductions claimed for your residential portfolio and individual properties. Complete Part 3A for an individual property or residential portfolio if: - the individual property was not sold this year AND you have transferred excess deductions to it in Part 2. - the last property in the residential portfolio was not sold this year AND you have transferred excess deductions to the residential portfolio in Part 2. Complete Part 3B for an individual property or residential portfolio if: - the individual property was sold this year and the sale was not taxable. - the last property in the portfolio was sold this year and one or more of the sales of all of the properties in the portfolio was not taxable. Complete Part 3C for an individual property or residential portfolio if: - the individual property was sold this year and the sale was taxable. - the last property in the portfolio was sold this year and ALL of the sales of the properties in the portfolio were taxable. Complete Part 3D for an individual property or residential portfolio if any of the following are true: - the individual property was not sold AND you have not transferred excess deductions to it in Part 2. - the last property in the residential portfolio w as not sold this year AND you have not transferred excess deductions to the residential portfolio in Part 2. - did not sell any properties in this year. - None of your properties showed a net loss at Step 13 (and you answered No to all at Step 14). Part 3A Individual property or last property in a portfolio not sold and has excess deductions transferred to it Complete this section for an individual property or residential portfolio that has not been sold this year but that has had unused excess deductions transferred to it from the sale of another residential portfolio or individual property in this income year at Step 17c or Step 19b. 14 Step 21 No sale of the individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio AND transferred excess deductions If you transferred unused excess deductions this year to a residential portfolio or individual property you have not sold, the transferred deductions will affect your net profit or loss at Step 13. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in this income year. This step calculates the excess deductions that must be carried forward for your residential portfolio or individual properties that were not sold in the income year and to which transfers of excess deductions were made. When your deductions exceed residential income for a residential portfolio or individual property in an income year, the excess deductions must be carried forward to a future income year in which you earn residential income. Excess deductions that arise from a residential portfolio or individual property can only be used against the residential income from that portfolio or property unless the property is sold. Step 21a Residential rental deductions claimed this year This step calculates the deductions that can be claimed this year for your residential portfolio or individual properties that were not sold in the income year and to which transfers of excess deductions were made. If a residential portfolio or individual property has a net loss then the amount of deductions that may be claimed this year is limited to the amount of income earned from the residential portfolio or individual property. If a residential portfolio or individual property has net income then all deductible expenses relating to that residential portfolio or individual property may be claimed this year. Step 21b Net residential income This step calculates the final net position for your residential portfolio and individual properties that were not sold in the income year and to which transfers of excess deductions were made. Part 3B Non-Taxable sales Complete this section for your residential portfolio and individual properties for which you answered Yes at Step 18. Step 22 Excess residential rental deductions to carry forward This step calculates the excess deductions that must be carried forward for your individual property that was sold in the income year where the sale was not taxable. This step calculates the excess deductions that must be carried forward for your residential portfolio that was sold in the income year where at least one sale of all the properties in the portfolio in any income year was not taxable. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in the income year. When your deductions exceed residential income for a residential portfolio or individual property in an income year, the excess deductions must be carried forward to a future income year in which you earn residential income. Excess deductions that arise from a residential portfolio or individual property can only be used against the residential income from that portfolio or property unless the property is sold. Step 22a Deductions claimed this year This step calculates the excess deductions that must be carried forward for your individual property that was sold in the income year where the sale was not taxable. This step calculates the excess deductions that must be carried forward for your residential portfolio that was sold in the income year where at least one sale of all the properties in the portfolio in any income year was not taxable. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in the income year. Calculate your deductions claimed this year by starting with your total deductions at Step 7. If you transferred any excess deductions from this property to one or more other properties at Step 17b or Step 19a, subtract the amounts transferred from your total deductions. If you transferred any excess deductions from another property to this property at Step 17c or Step 19b, then add the amounts transferred to your total deductions. Finally, subtract the amount of excess deductions to carry forward as calculated at Step 22. The amount of deductions for a residential rental property in an income year is limited to the amount of residential income you earn in the income year for the property. If your residential income is higher than the amount of deductible expenses you have incurred for the property, then you will be able to claim all your deductions. Step 22b Net residential income This step calculates the final net position of your residential portfolio and individual properties that this subpart applies to. Part 3C Taxable sales Complete this section for your residential portfolio and individual properties for which you answered Yes at Step 16. Step 23a Residential rental deductions claimed this year This step calculates the deductions that can be claimed this year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that were sold in the income year where the sales were all taxable. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in the income year. If the sale was taxable, you can claim all your deductions for the property minus any transferred amounts. Step 23b Net residential income This step calculates the final net position of your residential portfolio and individual properties that were sold in the income year where: - for a residential portfolio, the last property in the portfolio was sold and the sales of all the properties in the portfolio were taxable - for an individual property, the sale was taxable. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in the income year. This step also takes into account any unused excess deductions remaining after the taxable sale of an individual property or residential portfolio at Step 23. Unused excess deductions that remain after a taxable sale will relate to transfers made in previous years to the property from non-taxable sales. 15 Part 3D No sales of individual property or last property in a residential portfolio and no transferred excess deductions or no net loss at step 13. Complete this section for each individual property that you did not sell in this income year and that you did not transfer any unused excess deductions to at Step 17c or Step 19b. Complete this section for a residential portfolio if you did not sell the last property in the residential portfolio and you did not transfer any unused excess deductions to it at Step 17c or Step 19b. Complete this section if you sold a property in a residential portfolio that will continue to exist (ie, you did not sell the last property in the residential portfolio) and you did not transfer any unused excess deductions to the portfolio at Step 17c or Step 19b. Complete this section if you answered No at Step 15 because you did not sell any residential property this year. Complete this section if you answered No to all at Step 14 because none of your properties had a net loss this year. Step 24 Excess residential deductions to carry forward This step calculates the excess deductions that must be carried forward for your residential portfolio and individual properties that were not sold in the income year and to which no transfers of excess deductions were made. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in the income year. When your deductions exceed residential income for a residential portfolio or individual property in an income year, the excess deductions must be carried forward to a future income year in which you earn residential income. Excess deductions that arise from a residential portfolio or individual property can only be used against the residential income from that portfolio or property unless the property is sold. Step 24a Residential rental deductions claimed this year for each portfolio and property This step calculates the deductions that can be claimed this year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that were not sold in the income year and to which no transfers of excess deductions were made. If a residential portfolio or individual property has a net loss then the amount of deductions that may be claimed this year is limited to the amount of residential income for the residential portfolio or individual property. If a residential portfolio or individual property has net income then all deductible expenses relating to that residential portfolio or individual property may be claimed this year. Step 24b Net residential income This step calculates the final net position of your residential portfolio and individual properties that were not sold in the income year and to which no transfers of excess deductions were made. Part 4 Totals for income tax return This section must be completed for your residential portfolio and all individual properties that you own. The totals in this section must be entered in the relevant boxes on your income tax return. Step 32 Net residential income The total amount of net residential income may be a loss. This may happen if you have a net loss from the taxable sale of individual property, or the last property in a residential portfolio has been sold, and the sales of each property in the portfolio were taxable.
