REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENTS for the TAXATION (ANNUAL RATES, RETURNS FILING, AND REMEDIAL MATTERS) BILL 2011 • Simplifying filing requirements for individuals and record-keeping requirements for businesses • Tax treatment of profit distribution plans • Making KiwiSaver more cost effective • Tax minimum equity rules for foreign-owned banks • Non-resident film renters’ tax • Extending eligibility for the in-work tax credit to certain shareholder-employees • Liquidators and receivers changing GST accounting basis • GST and late payment fees Hon Peter Dunne Minister of Revenue Prepared by Inland Revenue and the Treasury September 2011 Regulatory Impact Statement Simplifying filing requirements for individuals and record-keeping requirements for businesses Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The problem that this statement addresses is the increasing number of contacts with taxpayers that Inland Revenue is required to process. Along with an increase in volume, there has been an increase in the complexity of these contacts. This statement provides an analysis of options to transform the way in which Inland Revenue delivers its services and with a view to reducing contacts. A major focus of the policy project has been to examine ways in which Inland Revenue can administer its responsibilities in a more efficient manner. The proposed approach adopts electronic services as the main method of service delivery and seeks to reduce compliance costs for businesses and individuals. The increase in contacts has been driven by a number of policy settings, such as the requirement for social policy recipients to file a tax return. Also driving this increase is the current ability for certain taxpayers to access refunds of over-deducted PA YE without having the reciprocal requirement to pay under-deducted PA YE. Although the proposals are intended to reduce these contacts, the extent to which they do this can be established only once they are made operational. The most significant dependency of the analysis is the ability of Inland Revenue to deliver significant operational change, particularly given its commitment to other major changes such as student loan redesign and the child support review. The design and information technology commitments to these two projects mean that there is limited ability for Inland Revenue to deliver other initiatives in the short to medium term. As a consequence, design and implementation of the proposals would be staggered from July 2011, with full implementation occurring 1 April 2015. The analysis summarised in this document has been the subject of public consultation via a Government discussion document and associated online forum, Making tax easier, released in June 2010. The proposals have been developed in light of the feedback received, and they strike a balance between the concerns raised in the submissions and the efficiency of tax administration. As the proposals were developed, more focused consultation was carried out with key selected stakeholders and interest groups. This feedback was also reflected in the policy design. The recommended policy proposals are intended to reduce compliance costs for businesses and individuals. They do not impair private property rights, although one of the proposals may reduce the net amount of refunds. They may also affect the business of the personal tax intermediary market, as one of the proposals will impact on the current business model used by these firms by reducing the net amount of refunds by requiring returns to be squared across four years. The recommended do not override fundamental common law principles. Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 25 July 2011 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The problem that this Statement addresses is that Inland Revenue's increasing number of contacts with taxpayers and the resulting processing is creating pressure on the administration of the tax system. The increase in contacts is due in part to the expansion of Inland Revenue's responsibilities into social policy administration through initiatives such as KiwiSaver, student loans. Working for Families tax credits and child support. Businesses and individuals find tax processes time-consuming and uncertain. 2. At a high level, the underlying causes of the problem can be categorised as the following: • Lack of certainty, due in large part to frequent changes to the tax rules: Although this is generally due to changes in Government policy, and is typically accompanied by public consultation, the frequency of tax changes has led to substantial increases in the number of taxpayers who require assistance from Inland Revenue. • Meeting the expectations of taxpayers: As the volume of tax returns and queries increases with changes to policy and the expansion of Inland Revenue's responsibilities, service delivery standards necessarily come under pressure. This expansion has also increased the expectations that taxpayers have of Inland Revenue. Because of the heavy reliance on paper (with around 26 million letters per year being sent to taxpayers), Inland Revenue's response times have come under pressure. • System integrity: Inland Revenue's FIRST computer system has been substantially added to and modified as a result of policy change, which has added to the pressure on the core strengths of New Zealand's tax system. It is integral to taxpayer trust that tax administration systems do not fail. 3. These problems are exacerbated by: • Inland Revenue's systems are designed to be as accurate as possible with minor variations generally netting out over time. For PA YE, deductions are based on current rates, and the annualising of the pay amount for individual pay periods may be out of line with individuals' annual income tax liabilities on their employment income (ignoring social assistance) in various situations. However, for PAYE, refunds can occur in a number of circumstances such as: o when individuals enter employment part way through the year, o have PAYE deducted at the non-declaration rate because they have not yet obtained an IRD number and tax code, o have deductions made at the incorrect code for whatever reason (including employer error), o change jobs during a year at different rates of pay, o have lumpy income (those in part time or casual employment based on hourly pay rates, where the amount may vary considerably from pay period to pay period), o hold more than one job at a time, o receive extra pays, and o do not earn uniform amounts of employment income in each pay period throughout a full tax year, for whatever reason, when personal tax rates change during the year. • Large numbers of individuals self-select to file an income tax return or receive a personal tax summary (also known as an income statement) in years in which they are due a credit. This has resulted in a significantly increased workload for Inland Revenue as people re-enter the annual filing system. This is in large part due to the ability of taxpayers to choose to file only when they are due a refund and not in years when they have tax to pay. • The graph below shows the increase in customer-requested personal tax summaries. In 2004, it took 60 months (from the close of return period) for the volume of self-selected personal tax summaries to reach 200,000. In 2008, it took only 14 months to reach this level. Cumulative volumes of customer-requested PTS refunds - as at end Aug 2010 400,000 350,000 300.000 100,000 50,000 250,000 200,000 150,000 '—•—2D04 relp\] -•-2005 relp . 2006 relp . i-K- 2007 relp I—X—2008 relp i 2009 relp • —I— 2010 relp i month\* from close of return period • The ability for some taxpayers to access refunds of over-deducted PAYE, but not pay their under-deducted PAYE, has resulted in a situation where large amounts of revenue are being paid out, without a reciprocal obligation on taxpayers to pay potential shortfalls as evidenced in the graph below. 2 Cumulative value $M (excluding WFF) of customer-requested PTS refunds months from close of ratum period -160 —•—2004 relp -•-2005 relp; -w- 2007 relp -•-2008 relp —•—2009 relp —f—2010 relp 2006 relp 1 0 • The requirement of people who interact with social policy programmes to file a tax return has also contributed to the increase in the volume of contacts. For example, large numbers of Working for Families tax credits recipients are required to file an income tax return because they receive these tax credits. However, all that is needed to assess their entitlement is their income and family details, rather than the amount of tax they have paid. • Electronic filing needs to be streamlined to remove the barriers that are currently discouraging businesses and individuals from using it. Specifically, some of the barriers that we can address immediately are: o A person who carries on business or derives income in New Zealand must also keep sufficient records in New Zealand. This is a problem for the increasing number of taxpayers who are choosing to use payroll or accounting software that uses offshore data storage. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue's discretion to exempt this requirement only extends to a "person", and this means that each individual needs to seek the exercise of discretion. Requiring individual applications for exemption is increasingly impractical given the rise in use of offshore data storage. o When information in a taxpayer's return has been provided to Inland Revenue electronically, the taxpayer is required to retain a paper copy of the information for seven years. Similarly, other information that is submitted electronically also needs a hard-copy transcript. To ensure consistency with policy objectives in the Electronic Transactions Act 2002, which in essence provides that the existence of readable and reliable electronic copies would satisfy a requirement to retain paper copies, this requirement needs to change. 3 4. The proposals have also been developed in light of submissions received on a Government discussion document and online forum, Making tax easier, which was released in June 2010. OBJECTIVES 5. The desired Government outcome is to have a tax administration that delivers value-for- money services and is sufficiently flexible to change and grow. This is in line with the Government's six economic policy drivers, one of which is a world-class tax system. 6. The options have been assessed against the following objectives: (1) they reduce tax compliance obligations for individuals and/or businesses, (2) they facilitate a move to using electronic services as the main form of service delivery by Inland Revenue, and (3) they are fair and equitable. 7. The move to electronic services is important because it is Inland Revenue's preferred method of delivery to deal with the increasing number of contacts with taxpayers. These services are in line with the expectations of taxpayers and would increase Inland Revenue's agility and flexibility. They would also potentially decrease the number of contacts, and make those contacts quicker and easier to deal with and lead to efficiency savings in the future. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 8. Two streams of policy initiatives have been developed to address the policy problems outlined above. These two streams can be broadly broken down into those that relate to individuals and those that relate to businesses. 9. Our preferred options are: Individuals • Require taxpayers who self-select to file an annual return (either an IR 3 or PTS) to be squared up across the previous four income tax years (Option 3). • Remove the requirement for Working for Families tax credit recipients to file an income tax return (Option 5). • Amalgamate the two major income tax return forms (that is the IR 3 and the PTS) and replace them with one consolidated web-based income tax return form (Option 7). • Move to the use of electronic services as the primary mode of service delivery, using a phase-in approach (Option 11). Businesses • Allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to authorise, and also revoke permission for, certain "classes of persons" to keep their records outside of New Zealand (Option 13). • Remove the requirement for taxpayers who submit electronic returns or information to Inland Revenue to retain paper copies (Option 14). 4 Option Negatives Positives Consultation Net impact Implementation issues INDIVIDUALS Options for reducing the number of taxpayers required to fde an income tax return 1. Make PA YE full and final at the point of deduction for employees in stable employment for 11 or more months in the year. • Taxpayers in stable employment for 11 or more months per year and who have PA YE over-deducted, would not be able to get the over-deducted PA YE refunded to Ihem. • Many taxpayers may disagree with this (as seen in consultation) mainly due to the potential for error in the PA YE system. • If there was an exemption from this rule for major over-deductions, this could be difficult to define and to administer. • Major administrative efficiencies for Inland Revenue (528,000 people would be taken out of the annual filing system). See the Making lax easier discussion document, paragraph 7.10. • Gives certainty to taxpayers, as large numbers would not be required to file. • Taxpayers who have been sent tax bills for small amounts of under-deducted PA YE would no longer be required to pay these amounts. • Addresses the problem of cherry picking (filing only in the years in which one is due a refund) to an extent. • Will increase Crown revenue to a moderate extent, but moreso than Option 3. • Public consultation took place via the Making tax easier discussion document and online forum. • Feedback was generally against this proposal. Submitters felt that it was too arbitrary, and that taxpayers have a right to file a return and get any over- deductions refunded to them. • Feedback also argued that there is too much potential for over-deduction in the PAYE system, and as long as this is the case, this option should not be progressed. • 528,000 taxpayers would no longer be able to file a tax return at the end of the income year. • Moderate increase in Crown revenue. • Efficiency gains to Inland Revenue (due to lowered contacts). • Potential pressure from taxpayers for refunds could make this difficult to administer in a consistent way. • Difficulty in assessing what makes a major over- deduction. • Potential for employers to consistently under-deduct PAYE, leading to large-scale under-payment of PAYE and income tax. • May push some taxpayers out of the PAYE system and into receiving cash payments which are not subject to withholding tax payments. • System updates required. 2. Set a de minimis amount for refunds, below which refunds would not be paid out (e.g. $50). • Very difficult to set an acceptable level, as any amount of refunded PA YE may be valuable to taxpayers, especially those on low incomes. • Fairness and equity - any amount of over-deducted PA YE should be refunded to its rightful owner. • Simple to administer. • Recognises the cost and difficulty of processing large volumes of small-value refunds. • Counteracts the cost of processing these small refunds. • This option was suggested by several submitters in response to the consultation on Option 1 (above) in Making tax easier. • 327,000 taxpayers would no longer be able to file (see the Making tax easier discussion document, paragraph 7.6). • Results in some Crown savings. • Some potential for employers to under-deduct PAYE to the extent of the de minimis. • Increased contacts, as individuals try to confirm the amount of their return. • System updates required. 3. Require taxpayers who self-select to file to be squared up across the previous four years. • Removes the ability for taxpayers to file only in the years that they are due a refund (i.e. cherry pick), but arguably this is a fairer outcome. • Does not have the same degree of administrative • This option is the best at addressing the problem of cherry picking refunds. • Would result in presently unpaid terminal tax being paid or offset against refunds. • Requires taxpayers to • This option was developed in light of the responses received in the Making tax easier consultation. • Retains the ability for taxpayers to file a return if they wish to, something that came across in submissions • No taxpayers would be prevented from filing, but those that are not required by law to file, would need to file for the previous four years. • Results in some Crown savings (approx. $27 million • Communicating the change to taxpayers, particularly that the rule would be phased in over several years. • Minimising administrative pressure would depend on the uptake of electronic services being successful. 5 Option Negatives Positives Consultation Net impact Implementation issues INDIVIDUALS Options for reducing the number of taxpayers required to file an income tax return savings as Option 1 may have. • Initially, the amount of refunds being released may increase, as taxpayers would be required to square up in years that they may not have otherwise. choose either accuracy of tax paid, or administrative efficiency. • Results in Crown revenue savings of S66 million over ten years. as being important to taxpayers. per year). • Potential operational pressure of ensuring that all taxpayers who self-select also do so for the previous four years. • Potential for taxpayers to tTy to "game" the system by attempting to bring themselves within the requirements to file. • System updates required. • There may be confusion from a customer perspective about what their final tax position actually is. 4. Retain the status quo, regarding the filing requirements of individuals. • Allows taxpayers flexibility to file only in the years where they are due a refund (cherry pick). • Large numbers of taxpayers who do not have to file are doing so anyway, which has resulted in large numbers of taxpayers being brought back into the system unnecessarily. • This increase in taxpayers filing causes pressure on the system. • Taxpayers understand the current system. • Public consultation via the Making tax easier discussion document and online forum. • The feedback received was mostly concerned with the ability for taxpayers to file and get back any potential over-deductions, which is something this option provides. • No taxpayers would be precluded from filing. • Taxpayers would still be able to cherry pick refunds. • No revenue savings for the Crown and no efficiency gains to Inland Revenue. • Large pressures on the system and resources, which have been caused by significant increases in recent years of taxpayers self-selecting to file (taxpayers who are not required to file but choose to anyway). This has largely been facilitated by personal tax summary intermediaries (PTSIs). See graphs on pages 2 and 3. 5. Remove the requirement for Working for Families tax credits recipients to file an income tax return. • This group would not have to pay terminal tax in the years that they are under- deducted; however, they also would not be automatically refunded over-deductions. • If the customer wants an overpayment of PA YE refunded, they would now fall into the four-year square up criteria and have to elect into the system. • Reduces the tax compliance obligations for this group by giving them a choice of whether to file or not. • This group would not have to pay terminal tax in the years that they are under- deducted; however, they also would not be automatically refunded any over- deductions. • Potential for some revenue savings to the Crown of approximately $10 million • This option has not been the subject of public consultation. • This option takes into account the concerns raised about the other proposals relating to individual filing, such as the importance of being able to file a tax return and be refunded any potential over-deductions. • Officials have consulted with NZICA, which supports this proposal, as it • Approximately 260,000 taxpayers would no longer be required to file a tax return. • Results in efficiency gains to Inland Revenue, and a reduction in compliance costs for taxpayers. • Results in some revenue savings for the Crown (approx. $10 million per year). • Significant system changes required. • Minimising administrative pressure would depend on the uptake of electronic services being successful. • There is potential that people within this group of taxpayers may be over- deducted, and if they do not file, they would not be refunded. • However, since they are currently required to file, 6 Option Negatives Positives Consultation Net impact Implementation issues INDIVIDUALS Options for reducing the number of taxpayers required to file an income tax return per year • The exact amount of revenue savings will differ according to whether large numbers in this group continue to file. • Gives this group equality with other taxpayers, as they now have the choice to file. reduces tax compliance for this particular group. they would be familiar with the process, and many of them may choose to continue to file. • Managing people through the change in process. 6. Retain the status quo whereby all Working for Families tax credit recipients are required to file a tax return. • All Working for Families tax credit recipients would be sent tax returns, which would mean that they would be required to pay terminal tax in the years when they have PA YE under-deducted. • Filing a tax return is arguably unnecessary for the bulk of these people, as all that is needed to assess their entitlement is their income, not how much PAYE they have paid. • All Working for Families tax credit recipients would be sent tax returns, which would mean that they would automatically get their refunds in years when they are due them. • This option has not been the subject of public consultation. • All Working for Families tax credit recipients would still be required to file. • No efficiency gains, compliance cost savings or Crown revenue savings. • There are approximately 400,000 recipients of Working for Families tax credits. Sending these taxpayers assessments and tax returns adds to the administrative burden on Inland Revenue. 7. Amalgamate the two major income tax return forms (the Personal Tax Summary and the 1R3). • Having a short form personal tax summary is useful for people with uncomplicated tax affairs. • Results in less confusion about which form taxpayers are required to file. • Results in less duplication of processes, as both forms require a degree of maintenance. • This option has not been the subject of public consultation. • Officials have consulted with NZICA and some representatives from the PTSI industry. Both support this option as it would reduce confusion about which tax return form to use and reduce the amount of paper they deal with on behalf of their clients. • This should result in significant efficiency savings for Inland Revenue (approx. $6 million per year once fully implemented) and tax agents, and also potentially taxpayers. • Less confusion for taxpayers regarding which form to file. • As the form will be primarily web-based, it may not suit all taxpayers. However, a paper version will be available in limited circumstances. • Would only work in a predominantly electronic environment. • Any paper version of an amalgamated tax return would be long and unsuitable for sending out in large volumes. • There would need to be a paper version for taxpayers who cannot use the online version, but this would function as a back-up channel only. • Significant system changes required. 8. Retain the status quo of two different income tax return forms • Taxpayers are often unsure of which of the two forms they should fill in, and contact Inland Revenue for • Many taxpayers are familiar with the current process. • Having a short form personal tax summary is • Same as above. • No efficiency gains for Inland Revenue. • Taxpayers would continue to use either of the forms. • The status quo is based on a paper delivery system and so adds considerably to the large volume of letters that 7 Option Negatives Positives Consultation Net impact Implementation issues INDIVIDUALS Options for reducing the number of taxpayers required to file an income tax return for individual taxpayers (the Personal Tax Summary and the IR3). guidance, which uses up administrative resources on what should be a simple decision. • Having two forms results in duplication, as any updates to personal income tax administration need to be done twice (i.e. for both forms). useful for people with uncomplicated tax affairs. Inland Revenue sends out each year. • If Inland Revenue moves to an electronic environment, the cunent forms would need to be substantially redesigned, as they have been developed for paper. 9. Mandate the use of electronic services. • Would not suit some taxpayers, which in turn may affect their ability to comply with their tax obligations. • Would result in a high uptake of electronic services, which would give Inland Revenue administrative efficiencies. • Would allow Inland Revenue to focus resources on the electronic channel. • Would allow private-sector providers such as PTSls to assist taxpayers with their filing obligations. • No need for a residual paper channel. • Public consultation via the Making tax easier discussion document and online forum. • There were strong views on either side of this option. o Those who had used Inland Revenue's current online services and were familiar with them were in support of the option. • Those who had not used these services were not in support. Many pointed out that many taxpayers may not have access to the internet or a computer, particularly older generations. They argued thai Inland Revenue should maintain a paper channel for these people. • The submissions from private-sector individuals and interest groups such as NZICA were overall in support of electronic services, but had reservations about making the use of them mandatory. • All individual taxpayers would be required to file online. • May result in a decrease in voluntary compliance among those unable or unwilling to file online. • Would result in a high degree of administrative efficiency for Inland Revenue. • This may push some people into simply not complying with their tax obligations if they cannot file online. • It may result in high demand on Inland Revenue's call centre if large numbers of taxpayers need support to use the online services. • It could pose issues regarding authenticating taxpayers and ensuring security online, such as keeping taxpayer details secret and secure. 10.

NZICA supports this option, but acknowledge that the services must be fit for purpose. The PTSIs support this option, as it should reduce the amount of paper they deal with on behalf of their clients, which in turn would improve their business processes. • Would potentially result in large numbers of taxpayers using online services. • If high uptake of online services, there would be significant administrative efficiencies for Inland Revenue. • May not be preferred by all taxpayers. • It would need to be managed carefully to ensure that: o There is sufficient uptake and enrolment for Inland Revenue's e- services. o Appropriate consultation and testing is done so that it is optimised, o It is simple and easy to use. o IR internal systems are able to cope with the increase to an e- environment. o It is robust and secure. • Getting most taxpayers using the services would be crucial so that Inland Revenue is not thinly spread across a range of channels. This could be difficult without mandating the use of 9 Option Negatives Positives Consultation Net impact Implementation issues INDIVIDUALS Options for reducing the number of taxpayers required to file an income tax return electronic services. 12. Retain the status quo whereby tax return filing is based on paper processes, with some tax filing services available online. • The heavy reliance on paper is unsuitable in the modem world, it is cumbersome, and it slows Inland Revenue's ability to deliver policy changes. • Difficult for Inland Revenue to try to maintain multiple channels. • Resources are spread thinly, as there is no scope to focus on one channel. • Suitable for taxpayers who do not have access to computers and the internet. • This option has not been the specific subject of public consultation, but it has been considered, given some of the strong objections that were received as part of the public consultation on the move to electronic services. • The submissions that were against mandating the use of electronic services were mostly concerned that there would be no back-up channel available for taxpayers who cannot use e- services.

The options have been developed in accordance with the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The initial consultation for these changes took the form of a June 2010 Government discussion document called Making tax easier. The discussion document outlined the potential new direction for Inland Revenue's delivery of services. It called for submissions from the public and was also accompanied by an online forum. 11. As the range of options were developed, officials engaged in more consultation as appropriate. As the consultation differed according to the particular proposal, a summary of the approach taken and the outcomes of consultation are outlined in the section on regulatory analysis. This format was also chosen in order to clearly show the impact that consultation had on the policy development, and the large extent to which the preferred options have been developed with the feedback in mind, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 12. For the options relating to individuals, the recommendations are those that best address the concerns detailed in the submissions received. For the options relating to employers, the recommendations are based on those that make the most administrative sense, and there has been consultation on these recommendations with the Software Developers Working Group. 13. Below is a table outlining the preferred options, and the key reasons why they are preferred: Option Key reasons 3 To require taxpayers who self- select to file to be squared up across the previous four income tax years • Best takes into account the argument, raised in submissions, that taxpayers should be able to claim amounts of over-deducted PAYE. • Reduces the number of contacts that Inland Revenue needs to process by consolidating the income tax return process. • Results in revenue savings. 5 Remove the requirement for Working for Families tax credit recipients to file an income tax return. • Reduces the compliance burden. • No sound policy reason to continue to require this group to file tax returns, given that the WFF tax credit process is now different to the income tax process. • Results in revenue savings. 7 Amalgamate the two major income tax return forms and replace them with one, consolidated, web-based form. • Results in less confusion for taxpayers regarding which form they should file. • Supported by NZICA and some representatives from the personal tax intermediary industry. • Significant step towards using electronic services as the main form of service delivery. 11 Move to the use of electronic services as the primary mode of service delivery, using a phase-in approach, • Takes into account the views raised in consultation, which were generally against mandating the use of electronic services. • Allows for taxpayers to be gradually moved across to electronic service with a minimum of disturbance. 13 Allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to authorise, and also revoke permission for, certain "classes of persons" to keep their records outside of New Zealand. • Extends existing policy (i.e. taxpayers can currently apply for an exemption to the current requirement to store records in New Zealand). • Simpler in an administrative sense, compared with requiring individual persons/businesses to make applications for an exemption. 14 Remove the requirement for taxpayers who submit electronic returns or information to Inland Revenue to retain paper copies. • Reduces compliance costs for businesses. • Consistent with the policy intent of the Electronic Transactions Act 2003, which treats electronic copies in a similar manner to that of paper. 12 IMPLEMENTATION 14. Implementation issues have been considered in the table under the regulatory impact analysis section of this statement. This is because the issues are many and varied, and are specific to each option. 15. For the implementation of these proposals, Inland Revenue has four major pressures: • addressing increasing demands for services • managing tight baseline funding • working with a computer system that has been substantially added to and modified • managing any move to a new platform. 16. The key goal is to manage these tensions while meeting Inland Revenue's current and future obligations. In particular, as a consequence of student loan and child support redesign project pressures, Inland Revenue is reassessing the impact of its capital position and capability requirements. 17. From the 2011/12 financial year, it is proposed Inland Revenue would take a strategic approach over a multi-year period to migrate taxpayers into the updated electronic environment. The initial work would include research to determine the mix of education, customer change management and awareness approaches that Inland Revenue would adopt. We would also work with third parties and customers to identify enhancements to our online services and products. 18. To mitigate the risk to the student loans and child support deliverables, we would propose that the application date for options 3, 5 and 7 be 1 April 2015 (the 2014/2015 income year). However, work would commence immediately on initial design work. As officials gain more understanding of the impacts of the other commitments, we would report back to Ministers on whether this application date can be brought forward. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 19. In general, the monitoring, evaluation and review of these proposals would take place under the GTPP. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves a post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, this would mean that these proposals would be reviewed at a time after the policy has had some time to work. Any changes that are needed to give the legislation its intended effect would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 13 Regulatory Impact Statement Tax treatment of profit distribution plans Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The problem addressed in the Statement is that the current tax treatment of profit distribution plans (PDPs) is inconsistent with the tax treatment of other similar arrangements. The objective is to align the tax treatment of PDPs with the tax treatment of other similar arrangements. This means there would be no opportunity to stream imputation credits, and shareholders would pay tax at their correct marginal tax rate on the distribution of bonus shares. The analysis assumes that the existing tax treatment applied to similar arrangements should also apply to PDPs, and that PDPs are being used only by listed companies. There are no other key gaps, assumptions, dependencies, significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the analysis. In June 2009, consultation on the tax treatment of PDPs was undertaken through a public issues paper. In May 2011, follow-up targeted consultation was undertaken on the draft legislative provisions for tax treatment of PDPs. As a result, alternative solutions for the tax treatment of PDPs were considered and are covered in this Regulatory Impact Statement. We have also consulted with the Treasury, who agree with our analysis. None of the policy options considered impair private property rights, restrict market competition, or override fundamental common law principles. Submitters have responded that the proposed solution may reduce the incentives for businesses to innovate and invest since the status quo provides an effective way for a company to retain capital rather than pay out dividends. Submitters also responded that the proposed new tax treatment of PDPs would impose additional compliance costs on businesses and shareholders. However, the proposed new tax treatment of PDPs does not impose higher compliance costs than already incurred when a regular dividend is paid. Inland Revenue 1 August 2011 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The problem addressed by this Regulatory Impact Statement is that the current tax treatment of profit distribution plans (PDPs) is inconsistent with the tax treatment of other similar arrangements. The current tax treatment of PDPs provides opportunities to stream imputation credits away from shareholders who cannot use them, towards shareholders who can use them. Secondly, shareholders may not be taxed on dividends at their personal tax rates. 2. A PDP is a scheme offered by companies whereby the company advises all its shareholders that they will be issued with bonus shares on a particular date. The shareholders are asked if they would like to have the company repurchase those bonus shares immediately after the shareholder receives them. If the shareholder does not elect to have some or all of their bonus shares repurchased, the default option is for the shareholder to retain the bonus shares. 3. The current tax treatment is that the bonus issue of shares under a PDP are treated as a non-taxable bonus issue and are therefore not subject to tax. Furthermore, the subsequent sale of the bonus shares on the market will not be subject to tax if the shareholder holds the shares on capital account. However, if a shareholder elects for the company to repurchase their bonus shares, the cash that they receive is treated as a dividend and is therefore subject to tax. Imputation credits may be attached to the cash dividend by the company and used to credit the tax payable by the shareholder. 4. In other similar arrangements where shareholders are given the choice of receiving cash or bonus shares, such as a dividend reinvestment plan 1 and a bonus issue in lieu 2 , the shareholder receives a taxable dividend whether they choose to receive the cash or shares. 5. Officials are aware of seven companies that have carried out PDPs in the past. In general these plans have been popular with publicly listed companies who have a large numbers of shareholders. However, we are aware of only one company that is currently carrying out PDPs. 6. PDPs are also popular because they are highly effective capital management tools. PDPs are successful at retaining capital because they benefit from lack of shareholder action. If the shareholder does not positively respond to the company and elect to have their bonus shares repurchased, the default position is for the shareholder to retain the bonus shares, thereby retaining capital in the company. If shareholders do not choose the cash option and as a result get bonus shares, they do not need to return these shares in their tax return. 7. The current tax treatment of PDPs provides an opportunity for imputation credits to be streamed, New Zealand resident companies can attach imputation credits to dividends paid to its shareholders, and shareholders can generally use the credits to reduce their tax payable in New Zealand. However, for some shareholders (such as foreign or tax exempt shareholders), imputation credits have little or no value as they can only be offset against taxable New ' A dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) is where a company provides all shareholders with a cash dividend, and then gives them the option of reinvesting their cash dividends in shares of the company. This can be advantageous for the company, allowing it to maintain a dividend payment policy, while providing an opportunity to increase cash retentions. DRPs are also convenient for shareholders as they are a method for shareholders to reinvest their cash dividends in a company at a lower cost and effort than purchasing shares on the market. If the shareholder does not make an election, the default option is to receive a cash dividend. 2 A "bonus issue in lieu" is a tax concept. It is a bonus issue of shares made under an arrangement where a company gives its shareholders a choice whether to receive a bonus issue or money or money's worth. Under a bonus issue in lieu arrangement, regardless of whether the shareholder chooses to receive bonus shares or money, they are subject to tax. 2 Zealand income. This creates an incentive to direct the credits to those shareholders who are best able to use them (a practice known as imputation credit "streaming"). Tax rules generally prevent imputation credit streaming. 8. Imputation credit streaming can take place under a PDP when shareholders self-select whether to redeem their bonus shares for a cash dividend, depending on whether or not they can utilise imputation credits that would be attached to a cash dividend. Those shareholders who are unable to utilise imputation credits, for example foreign or tax exempt shareholders, may elect to receive bonus shares that are non-taxable. As the bonus shares are non-taxable, imputation credits will not be attached, preserving the credits for shareholders who can best use them. This defeats the current policy settings for the imputation system. 9. The current tax treatment also raises issues related to equity. Under a PDP: • shareholders on personal tax rates higher than the company rate may not pay tax at their marginal tax rate on the distribution of the shares from the company; and • shareholders who are receiving social assistance may receive entitlements that they would not receive if the bonus shares were taxable. 10. The current tax treatment of PDPs was the subject of a specific Inland Revenue product ruling in 2005. This ruling was made subject to certain conditions, including that the company making the bonus issue has sufficient credits in its imputation credit account to have fully imputed a cash dividend equal to the bonus issue not redeemed. On 31 March 2009, that product ruling expired. 11. On 16 April 2010, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue announced that the Government would clarify the law to ensure that bonus issues of shares distributed under PDPs are taxed in the same way as shares issued under other dividend reinvestment plans. 12. If the current tax treatment is retained, the tax treatment of PDPs will remain inconsistent with other similar arrangements. In addition, no action in this area may encourage imputation credit streaming. 13. We estimate that retaining the status quo rather than adopting the recommended option would result in a fiscal loss of approximately $0.76m per annum. OBJECTIVE 14. The objective is to align the tax treatment of bonus shares provided under a PDP with the tax treatment of other similar arrangements. This is satisfied if the following two conditions are met: 1. PDPs are not able to be used to stream imputation credits There are tax rules that prevent imputation credits from being directed to shareholders who can best use them (streaming). 2. Equity Under current policy settings, a taxpayer's total annual income should be taxed at their personal tax rates under the progressive tax rate structure. In addition, all the income of taxpayers should be taken into account for social assistance purposes. 3 15. Alongside this objective, we have also taken into account compliance and administration costs. As far as possible, the compliance costs faced by taxpayers should be minimised. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 16. A number of options have been considered for the tax treatment of PDPs: • Option 1 (our recommended option): treat the bonus shares issued under a PDP as a taxable dividend. Shareholders would be taxed when they receive their bonus shares. If shareholders are required to file a tax return, they must include the dividend income in their return. • Option 2: treat the bonus shares issued under a PDP like a taxable dividend, and also give shareholders who are already required to file a tax return the option to include the bonus shares as a dividend in their return. • Option 3: require the company to debit its imputation credit account (ICA) when issuing bonus shares, and also pay a levy as compensation for shareholders that may be on the top marginal tax rate and who, as a result of this proposal, do not return the income and pay tax at their personal tax rate. The ICA would be debited at the maximum imputation ratio (ordinarily 28%) on the value of the bonus shares that are retained by recipient shareholders. The additional levy could be up to 5%. • Option 4: require the company to debit its ICA at the maximum imputation ratio (ordinarily 28%) with respect to the bonus shares that are retained by recipient shareholders, without requiring payment of an additional levy. • Option 5: retain the status quo. Shareholders who retain their bonus shares issued under a PDP are not taxed, while shareholders who redeem their bonus shares are treated as receiving a taxable dividend. 17. Option one was the option originally proposed by officials in the 2009 issues paper. In May 2011 legislation was drafted based on this option and sent out for targeted consultation. Options two, three and four arose from consultation with interested parties. 18. Officials' analysis of the options is summarised in the following table: Options Costs Benefits Conclusion One: treat bonus shares issued under a PDP as a taxable dividend. - Higher compliance costs than the status quo, borne by shareholders and the company. - May discourage capital raising when compared to the status quo, but not when compared to substitutable arrangements. - Limits imputation credit streaming opportunities. - Equitable as it ensures shareholders are taxed at their personal tax rates. - Ensures substitutable arrangements are treated the same. - Fiscally positive. Recommended option Net impact: positive. Improvement on the status quo (equitable outcome, equivalent treatment with substitutes, and prevents streaming opportunities). However, does increase compliance costs. 4 Options Costs Benefits Conclusion Two: treat bonus shares as a taxable dividend and give shareholders an option to include bonus shares in their tax return. - Does not treat substitutable arrangements the same. - Income may not be counted for social assistance purposes which may mean that taxpayers receive benefits that they would not receive if the payment was taxable. - Limits imputation credit streaming opportunities. Not recommended Net impact: marginally positive. Improvement on the status quo (prevents streaming). However, results in inequitable outcome, and does not result in equivalent treatment with substitutes. Three: require company to debit ICA and pay an additional levy. - Does not treat substitutable arrangements the same. - Low rate shareholders are effectively taxed at higher rates. - Income is not counted for social assistance purposes which may mean that taxpayers receive benefits that they would not receive if the payment was taxable. - Administratively complex because it is likely to require the creation of a new revenue item for Inland Revenue systems, and new forms/guides for the company. - Limits imputation credit streaming opportunities. - Low compliance costs for shareholders. - Addresses fiscal concerns with shareholders not paying their personal tax rates on income. Not recommended Net impact: negative. High administrative costs, inequitable outcome, and does not result in equivalent treatment with substitutes. However, does reduce compliance costs for shareholders, and prevents streaming. Four: require company to debit ICA. - Does not treat substitutable arrangements the same. - Low rate shareholders are effectively taxed at a higher rate, and higher rate shareholders are taxed at a lower rate. - Income is not counted for social assistance purposes which may mean that taxpayers receive benefits that they would not receive if the payment was taxable. - Fiscally negative: estimated at $7m revenue loss per annum. Costs borne by the Government. - Limits imputation credit streaming opportunities. - Low compliance costs for shareholders. - A cheap and effective way of raising capital, and because tax treatment is concessionary, companies may be encouraged to use PDPs in order to raise capital. Not recommended Net impact: negative. Inequitable outcome, fiscally negative, and does not result in equivalent treatment with substitutes. However, does reduce compliance costs for shareholders, and prevents streaming. Five: retain status quo. - There are imputation credit streaming opportunities. - Shareholders in similar arrangements are subject to more tax. - Bonus issues are not counted for social assistance purposes which may mean that taxpayers receive benefits that they would not receive if the payment was taxable. - Estimated revenue loss of $0.76m per annum when compared to the recommended option - Low compliance costs for the company and its shareholders - A cheap and effective way of raising capital. Not recommended Net impact: negative. Maintains status quo (streaming opportunities, and inequitable outcome) 5 19. Option one is the recommended option. This option treats substitutable arrangements the same for tax purposes, and as such, it meets the key objective. As such, it prevents opportunities for imputation credit streaming, and it ensures that shareholders are taxed at their personal tax rates on distributions from the company. It addresses the concerns regarding social assistance because a shareholder must include the bonus shares issued under a PDP in their tax return. Option one (the recommended option) results in more revenue being raised when compared to the status quo. 20. Officials note that option one imposes higher compliance costs on shareholders and the company when compared to the status quo. However, these costs are no higher than if a cash dividend was paid. Therefore, we do not anticipate that this option would impose significant costs beyond those already being incurred in the normal course of business. This is because publicly listed companies generally already have mechanisms in place for withholding resident withholding tax (RWT) or non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on dividends 3 . If RWT is correctly deducted, a resident shareholder will not be required to file a tax return, simply because they receive a dividend under a PDP. A resident shareholder will only have to put the dividend in their tax return if they are already filing a tax return because, for example, they have income that has not had tax deducted at source (such as rents). For these shareholders, due to the rate of RWT on dividends, it is unlikely that the shareholders would face a tax liability as a result of the dividend. As such, we do not expect this to result in cash- flow problems for shareholders. 21. Although options two, three and four prevent opportunities for imputation credit streaming, they do not result in consistent treatment with substitutes and therefore do not tax shareholders at their personal tax rates. Therefore, these options are not recommended. They also raise concerns with social assistance entitlement, administrative simplicity and fiscal constraints. 22. Option five does not meet any of the objectives, and it also raises equity concerns. Therefore, this option is not recommended. 23. The economic, fiscal, compliance and social implications of the options are outlined in the table above. None of the options have environmental or cultural impacts. CONSULTATION 24. Officials have consulted interested parties in two formal rounds of consultation. 25. The first round of consultation was open to the public where officials released an issues paper in June 2009. The issues paper proposed to amend the definition of "bonus issue in lieu" to include shares issued under a PDP, so that they would be subject to tax. Six submissions were received in response to this issues paper. 26. The feedback received from the first round of consultation was generally negative. All six submitters opposed the change that was proposed. The key reasons were: • The form and substance of dividend reinvestment plans (DRPs) and PDPs differ and the tax treatment should be determined by the form rather than the substance of the transaction. 3 NRWT is a final tax for non-resident shareholders. 6 • PDPs result in a high rate of retention of reserves. This outcome is good for New Zealand companies and the economy. Taxing the bonus issue of shares under PDPs would result in PDPs no longer being a viable mechanism to retain cash reserves. • The tax consequences of PDPs would become too complicated to explain to shareholders, particularly as a result of the inconsistency in the resident withholding tax (RWT) rate on dividends (33%) compared with the company tax rate and the maximum imputation ratio (generally 28%). • Relatively little weight should be placed on the concern that investors with marginal tax rates above the company rate benefit from a tax advantage. These taxpayers are equally able to reduce their tax liability by investing in a trust, portfolio investment entity or company and the medium-term Government policy is to move towards alignment. • The proposal to tax PDPs like a bonus issue in lieu could lead to double taxation. • Any potential fiscal cost would only be minimal, and the fiscally positive aspects of PDPs (such as additional tax revenue generated from the business operations) were not factored in. • It would be more appropriate to include PDPs in a wider review of imputation. 27. After the first round of consultation, the Capital Markets Development Taskforce (the Taskforce) reported, stating that it: ...considers it important that the tax system treats substitutable transactions neutrally. If PDPs are substitutable for ordinary dividend payments with optional reinvestment, the tax treatment should ideally be identical in both cases. The same goes for other close substitutes. Otherwise, there is a danger that investment decisions will be biased towards companies that offer PDPs, and that there could be significant loss of tax revenue from normal dividend taxation. At the same time, the Taskforce considers it desirable that the tax system does not impede the supply of capital. A decision on the tax treatment of PDPs should, therefore, take into account the fact that PDPs are an effective way for companies to raise capital. Recommendation: We recommend that changes to the tax treatment of PDPs should be made as part of a broader review of tax settings and take into account any adverse impacts on capital-raising costs. 28. Officials considered the Taskforce's report and agreed with their concerns around substitutability. Following this report, officials consulted on a solution that provided for a more consistent tax treatment across close substitutes. 29. Consequently we proposed treating bonus shares issued under PDPs like a taxable dividend. In May 2011, we began our second round of consultation by seeking comments on draft legislation, which would have treated bonus shares issued under a PDP in the same way as a taxable dividend. The draft legislation was sent to the six parties that had responded to the earlier round of consultation, as well as one other party who officials considered would be interested in the issue. 7 30. Several submitters provided feedback about the wording of the draft legislative provisions. This feedback would be taken into account in any drafting. 31. Some submitters also commented on policy matters. One submitter expressly supported the proposed change, and considered that shares issued under a PDP were the same as a taxable dividend for all practical purposes. Other submitters expressed concerns with the proposed tax treatment. The concerns that differed from the first round of consultation were: • A PDP is not a dividend because it does not involve a transfer of value. • There are other related inconsistencies in the tax acts that should be addressed, such as the RWT rules. • Additional consultation was needed. 32. In addition to these two formal consultation rounds, the Minister of Revenue has on a number of occasions announced the progression of work on PDPs, and officials have been involved in a number of discussions with interested parties. Options two, three and four arose out of those discussions. These three options, along with option five, would allow PDPs to continue to be viable and cost-effective capital raising tools. 33. The key argument made by submitters has been that the proposed change would increase compliance costs for companies and shareholders to the extent that PDPs would no longer be a viable mechanism to achieve retention of cash reserves. 34. We acknowledge that after the change in the tax treatment there may be higher compliance costs for shareholders and for the company. However, as already noted, we do not anticipate that these costs would be significant. 35. It should be noted that the compliance costs of the recommended option are no greater than those currently faced by companies that pay dividends. Companies paying dividends are already required to report this in their tax returns. Under current law, many shareholders can already choose to not file a tax return even when they receive taxable dividends. This will be the case, for example, where the only other income they are receiving is employment income, or interest or dividends that have had tax correctly deducted at source. Shareholders will generally be required to recognise dividend income in their tax return only if they are required to file for some other reason (for example, if they have income which has not had tax deducted at source, such as rents). CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 36. Option one is the recommended option and involves treating the bonus shares issued under a PDP in the same way as a taxable dividend. This would ensure that substitutable transactions are treated the same way for tax purposes, opportunities for imputation credit streaming are minimised, and dividends are effectively taxed at the shareholders' personal tax rates. 37. Although many of the other options prevent opportunities for imputation credit streaming, they do not treat substitutable arrangements the same. They also raise other concerns, such as equity and fiscal concerns. 8 IMPLEMENTATION 38. It is proposed that the necessary legislative changes be included in the tax bill that is due to be introduced in September 2011, with application from a prospective application date after date of enactment. There would be no need to implement transitional rules. 39. If option one (the recommended option) is adopted, the new rules would be administered by Inland Revenue through existing channels. Companies would be required to recognise bonus shares issued under a PDP in their tax returns as a dividend paid out. Shareholders who currently file tax returns would be required to include the bonus shares issued under a PDP as dividend income in their tax returns. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 40. Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves a post-implementation review of the legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. 9 'Regulatory Impact Statement Makin g KiwiS aver more cost-effective Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue and the Treasury. It provides an analysis of options for changes to KiwiSaver, to boost national savings. These are scheduled to be announced as part ofBudget 201 1. The Government has signalled its desire to focus Budget 2011 on measures which will boost national savings as this will help to address economiclmbalances and reduce New Zealand,s indebtedness, either by enabling current debt to be paid down or by reducing the need for borrowing in the future. As the quickest way for the Govemment to improve national saving and reduce economic imbalances would be to improve its own saving position,l the identifióation and development of options quickly nanowed to those most ü\[ely to reduce Government spending without undermining the primary purpose of KiwiSaver. A key asSumption is that any changes should be directed towards altering the balance of contributions made by each of the contributing parties (the member, their Jmployer and the Çrown) away from public flrnding and towards private saving. Any Crown incãntives to save through KiwiSaver should be directed appropriately. This papei also analyses options for increasing the numbers en¡olled in KiwiSavà, \*d/or increãsing the amo;nt of members, contributions, again with the aim of boosting national savings, and encouraging private savings behaviour that is focused on the long term retum-and specificall| individual retirement. The impacts of each option cannot be easily modelled using historical data, given the relative newness of the KiwiSaver savings model, nor is international comparison ul\*uyr appropriate, given many of KiwiSaver's unique features and New Zealand's TTE model otiaxationi. Our analysis of the options i"s therefore dependent on behavioural assumptions, for which there is minimal empirical evidence, about individuals' and employ"rr' i"rponses to changes in savings incentives and other regulatory requirements, In-módelling the effects on the Net Intemational Investment Position (NIIP), the assumption has been made that additional national savings reduces the cunent account deficit iather than increases overall domestic investment. To the extent that these changes instead boost domestic invsstment, the impact on the NIIP will be smaller. These assumptions are consistent throughout, so \*, huu" greater confidence in the relativity between the varíous results than in their absolute levels. I SavÍng ín New Zeølancl - Icsues øncl Optrbas (The Treasury, September 2 Tu\*". are often classified accordíng to whether income is taxed (T), ta di when income is first earned, secondly when ìnvest ís when income is spent, New Zealand''s TTE appro m come (T), tax is paid on ínvestment income arising from the contributions (T) and withdrawals from te exempt (E). Many other countries have specíal retirement saving vehicles ì¡ât ur" taxed on an EEi basis; so money placed in these vehicles is not taxed when first earned, nor as it compãunds, but it is when it is withdrawn from the fund. We have reconciled, as far as possible, each option for change with the primary pu¡pose for which Kiwisaver was designed, whioh was to provide an easy-access, work-based low-risk produot, which would enable individuals and households who might not be saving enough for their retirement to do so. KiwiSaver was not explicitly designed as an instrument to boost national savings and so, although it can make a positivo contribution, its effectiveness towards this objective is likely to be more limited. We have also recognised that KiwiSaver is less than five years old. Since its launch in July 2007, there have been several significant changes to contribution requirements, which have mostly affected employees and their employers, as well as new providers entering into the KiwiSaver market. The KiwiSaver industry has not experienced any period of stability in which to establish its core products, and this uncertainty and unpredictability is not helpful to either the industry or savers. Any changes made at this point in time should therefore be sustainable and, where possible, use pre-existing features of KiwiSaver rather than introduce new features, Our analysis draws on matters identified by other interestcd agencies, including the Retirement Commissioner and the Govemment Actuary. As the need for Budget secrecy has limited opportunities for formal public consultation in the usual manner under the Generic Tax Policy Process, we have also drawn on the considerations of the Savings Working Group3, which was commissioned by the Minister of Finance in August 2010 to provide a point of referÞnce for the Government in developing its medium-teün savings strategies. The proposals do not impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. The proposal to increase the compulsory employer contribution rate at the same time as increasing the minimum employee contribution rate' will lead to some additional costs on businesses that employ staft by increasing labour costs; ìn the short term thís may reduce firm profitability. The additional cost for employers is likely eventually to be reflected in wage settlements for all employees, although this impact should be limited as the economy and nominal wage growth ate expected to strengthen from the end of 2011.

This RIS summarises off,rcials' analysis of various changes to I(iwisaver that havebeen considered in order to deliver two objectives: o to help return the Crown to surplus sooner by reducing the fiscal costs of l(iwiSaver; and o to continue to encourage increased levels of private household savings, and a long- term savings habit and asset accumulation, in order to increase well-being and fìnancial independence in retirement. 2. Analysis of each of the key options for change is summarised in the table at paragraph 16. STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Economic Growth ønd Savìng Levels 3. The Government is concetned that, in recent years, New Zealancl's economic growth perfotmance has been poor by developed country standards, ancl our relative position in the OECD is well below average. In addition, as the Savings Working Group (SWG) noted, New Zealand's low rate of saving has created a dependency on foreign capital to fulfill clomestic investment clemancl. This has created a large and persistent gap between New Zealand's investment attcl saving levels, as reflected in the current account clef,rcit over several decacles. The SWG agreecl with the analysis set out in the Treasury's discussion document4 that this presents two serious economic problems: firstly it makes the New Zealand economy too vulnerable to market shocks; secondly, it has an adverse impact on economic performance, especially growths. 4. In adclition, the Governrnent has signalled its desire to move quickly to recluce Government debt and return to fiscal surplus. Lifting the level of national savings would help to address economic imbalances, recluce New Zealand's indebteclness and thus possibly contribute to improved economic growth. The Govemment has indicated that the focus of Budget 2011 will be on national savings and investment. As noted by the SWG, returning towards fiscal surplus, as well as encouraging private inclividuals to save more, is an important component of irnproving the national savings position. KìwíSuver 5. The objective of I(wiSaver, as set out in the l(iwiSaver Act 2006,is"to encoLtrctge ct long-term savings habit ond qsset accumulation by individuuls who ctre not in a position to enioy stondards o.f litting in retirement similctr to those in pre-retirement". It was not explicitly designed as an instrument to boost national savings per se, but instead to increase individuals' well-being and frnancial independence in retirernent, as a complement to New Zealand Superannuation for those who wish to have more than a basic stanclard of living in retirement. 4 Th" Tr"nrr.y,"Soving in New Zeolanrl", op, cit. s"Saring Ne¡v Zeuktntl: Retlucing I/ulnerabilities ctncl But'riers to Crowllt anrl Prosperiry", Savings Working Croup Final Report to the M inister of Finance, January 20 I I , Section 2. 6, I(iwiSaver was clesigned with features intenclecl to encourage long-term savings, by making it easy and attractive to join, plovicling relatively limitecl opportunities to access savings once enrolled, and providing incliviclual savers with opportunities to exercise as much or as little choice over their savings as they wish to or are able to. Although membership is available to all eligible New Zealand residents, many of the key features of Kiwisaver are those of a work-based superannuation scherne, such as the automatic enrohnent of employees, decluctions at source and (cornpulsory) employer contributions. 7. The numbers enrolling in I(iwiSaver have consistently outstrippecl initial forecasts, and the present membership is double that forecast in 2007. The latest I(iwisaver Evaluation report6 concluded that I(wiSaver's features are working as intended, pafticularly in attracting people into a savings product. It also concluclecl that I(wiSaver has generated some level of uew savings, over and above what would have been saved in the absence of KiwiSaver. 8. KiwiSaver therefore has a potentially significant role to play in increasing national savings, both through the savings contributions made by members, and in promoting awareness about savings and inculcating a savings habit among a large rnajority of the population, However, the cost to the Government is signifìcant and this restricts the benefits to national savings; a recent Cohnar Brunton survey indicates that the percentage of contributions that were "new" savings (as opposecl to cliverted from other forms of saving) at approximately 29Yo7. This is partly because some of the private funcls going into KiwiSaver accounts are being diverted from other savings rather than being aclditional saving, and partly because the Govemment's contribution rneans that inclividuals clo not have to save as much themselves to achieve the same eventual outcornes. OBJECTIVES 9. One of the Governrnent's key goals for 2011 is to build the foundations for a stronger economy. The Government has therefore outlined several objectives, inclucling building savings and investment in New Zealancl. The Prime Minister has signalled the intention to focus Budget 20l l on measures which will boost national saving, by encouraging additional saving from private individuals and through Government efficiency savings. Further information on these objectives was providecl in the Prirne Minister's Statement to Parliament on 8 February 201 t8: Building Scntings and \[nvestment: \[n order to reduce our clependence on .foreign lenders, Nevv Zealctnd neecls to build up the pool o.f Kiwi-owned savings and int¡estment, held by both the Government ctnd everyday New Zeulctnders.

The objectives for any changes to l(wiSaver are: o to help retum the Crown to surplus sooner by reducing the fiscal costs of I(iwiSavere, and o to continue to encourage increased levels of private household savings, and a long- term savings habit and asset accumulation, in order to increase well-being and financial independence in retirement. I 1' Each of the options for change that could meet one or more of these objectives was assessed against a matrix of criteria: o impact on national savings, which was measured as the effect on the Net International Investment Position (NIIP) over ten years o fiscal costs/fiscal savings . economic impacts, such as the likely effect on labour costs ancl hence employer costs and profitability o social welfare and clistributional impacts on those on the lowest income . alignment with the broader l(iwiSaver framework and objective. 12' In making this assessment, the strongest weight was given to measures which reduced fiscal costs, in light of earlier advice from the Treasury that reducing the defrcit sooner is the most impoftant contributor to national saving. Actditional weight was also given to options that did not threaten other aspects of the economic well-being, such as employment, or the social welfare of those on the lowest income. Further analysis of each option, including variations and dependencies between the options, is cliscussed below. 13. On a practical level, attention was also quickly directed towarcls options for change that could be developed in the immediate and short term, given the tight time-frames for delivery in Budget 2011, Certain options were therefore not taken forward, or further consideration within a longer time-frame was recommended, as the necessary consultation and irnplementation work coulcl not be clelivered within the timescale of this Budget.

Treasury and Inlancl Revenuue officiials providecl support to the SWG. Other policy reports were received by Ministers regarding KiwiSaver's role in the overall savings package. 16. A large number of potential changes to l(wiSaver have been discussed iin the public arena over the last five months because of the SWG review, such as thre KiwiSiaver clefault provider arrangements, managernent of funds, consulner financial literæcy, and provicler fee sttuctures. Some potential options for change were considered by the S\\l/G and are discussed in their interim and final report. Some of their recommenclations are witlhin the remit of other Govemment clepartments; for example, the Ministry of Economic Dexøelopmentt3 recently issuecl a discussion document regarding periodic reporting. l7' This RIS does not replicate all of the discussions about potential oprtions forr changes to I(iwiSaver that have been considered. Insteacl, it summarises officjials' aclvice on the developmeut of a preferred package of feasible changes, assessecl againsü the criteria outlined in paragraph 11, to cleliver the Governrnent's objectives for Budget z0ll. t 8. The options considered in more cletail in cleveloping this preferrecl parckage !v,,€re: Key objective: Recluce the fiscal costs of KiwiSaver . Changing KiwiSaver incentives and entitlement rules: memben'tax creclits (MTCs), initial Crown contribution ("kick-stafi"), ancl employer supemlÌnuationr contribution tax (ESCT) exemption. Seconclary objective: Encourage increasecl levels of private hou¡sehold saving . Increasing membership of l(wiSaver, including some form of curmpulsiton . Increasing contributions frorn existing members . Increasing contributions from employers. 19' In exploring the options uncler each objective, the clirectional'effect on the other objective hacl to be considered. For example, an increase in l(iwiSaver r.rrembership woulcl, in the short term, increase the atnount of "kick-start" payments macle ancl, in the longel term, increase the numbers clairning MTC, An increase in members' contribtution levels coulcl also lead to increased MTC payments; so although both changes might inclrease pri,vate savings, they would move against the objective of reducing the fiscal costs of I(iw¿iSaver. 20. For most optious, there were a number of potential variations. S'onle options were inter- clepenclent, while others were consiclered as cornplementary but indepøndent. Mar-ry of the options consiclered had several sub-variations; for example, varying cnntributlion rates per contributor, or re-sttucturing incentives such as the kick-start ancl memli,,er tax creclit amounts and entitlernent/payment mechanisrns. The rnain variations that were explored are cliscussed uncler each option below. t3ivtEODiscussion Paper,PeriotlicReportingRegulutions.forRetuil KiwisuverScherrzes,re\[easrr:d 0Il\]2l2tl0. KiwiSaver options explorecl Reducing Jìscul costs by chungìng KíwíSuver subsidìes: Generctl 21. One of the biggest impacts the Govemment can have on national savings is by returning to a budget surplus as quickly as is reasonably possible. An effective way to achieve this is by cutting low-value frscal spencling. Under the curent I(iwiSaver settings, there are opportunities to achieve lower fiscal costs while having minimum impact on encouraging household saving. In order to recluce the fiscal costs of I(iwiSaver, the various subsidies must either be reduced or removecl, whether for all members or through more direct targeting of subsidies to particular member groups. 22. Government contributious to KiwiSaver through direct subsidies (kick-start and MTCs) and forgone tax (ESCT exemption) total over $1 billion per annum; this is estimatecl at about 40o/o of total contributions in 2009/10. The current settings mean that Govemment contributions will make up a significant ptoportion of individual I(iwiSaver balances at retirement. Empirical evidence suggests that this expenditure is clelivering poor value in tenns of leveraging additional savings. Some of the savings going into l(iwiSaver accounts are being divertecl from other forms of saving rather than additional saving. Also those individuals saving towarcls a target level of income in retirement may reduce their own level of saving in response to Government contdbutions, since they can achieve the sarne f,rnal accumulations at less expense to themselves. Genuine additional private saving may therefore be as little as $29 for each $100 contributed by Government. 23. Although two thirds of members in the Cohnar Brunton survey citecl Govetnment subsiclies as one of the reasons why they joined l(iwiSaver, other features such as auto- enrolment, ease of contribution (cleductions from pay) ancl employer contributions were also importantta. The ESCT exemption, being relatively hidden, clid not feature in the survey responses. Clrangíng KiwíSaver subsìdíes: ùIember tøx credits 24. The Government cumently pays a member tax credit (MTC), up to a maximum of $1,042.86 ayear) into the account of members agecl over 18, which matches contributions rnade by the individual during the year. MTC payments for the year to 30 June 2010 totalled about $665 million. 25. Reducing the maximum annual MTC payment alone (i.e. without changing the matching rate) would provide imrnediate frscal savings. It woulcl also recluce the total accumulation in inclividual I(iwiSaver accounts, compared to leaving the MTC maxirnum atnount unchanged. However, other changes, such as increasing the matching rate or, notably, incteasecl ernployer contributions, will work in the opposite clirection to raise total accumulations. 26, The MTC is clesigned to encourage and rewarcl the clevelopment of a regulal pattern of savings once members have joined I(iwiSaver. However, the cument $ t to $ t matching rate is particularly generous by comparison with other savings options; it cloubtes the amount of contributions made (up to $1,042), effectively provicling a minimum 100% return on these contributions, l4 Col,nur Blunton Ki¡visrtver Evaltrcttiorr,op. cit, page 57. 27. MTCs are sirnple ancl relatively easy to aclminister because they are linkecl to the level of a metnber's contributions paid in a year rather than to the member's income. The cap ensutes that lower contributors, who tend to be lower income eamers, get a larger benefit proportionate to their contribution. The possibility of making a link between maximum entitlement, or matching rates, and a rnember's income (whether just active or active and passive income) was considered. However, the administrative reality is that any such link is not possible without prohibitively costly system changes, and even then woulcl take several years to implement. 28. The SWG suggested increasing MTC payrnents for those on lower incomes by increasing the matching rate to 52 MTC for each $1 member contribution, in order to increase the amounts received by those on lower incomes making lower contributions. However, as well as increasing the fiscal cost of the MTC this coulcl also have the effect of encouraging/enabling those on higher incomes to reduce their contributions, either by reducing their contribution rate or making fewer voluntary contributions (if self-employed) in order to maximise their MTC, 29. The converse matching position, f-or example 50c per $1 member contribution, should not lead to a reduction in contributions from those cumently contributing to the maximum MTC level, since they would still need to contribute the same to maximise the Government contribution. A reduction in the matching rate spreads the irnpact more broadly tl'ran reducing the cap alone, which would cleliver fiscal savings only in the case of KiwiSaver members contributir-rg above the level of the cap. The cap would fllean that the subsicly woulcl remain broaclly progressive, and still reflect a greater proportion of total I(iwiSaver inputs for low income earners than for highu income earners. Chunging IfiwíSaver íncentíves: Kìck-start 30. The $1,000 kick-start payment from the Crown is a highly successful o'recognition" feature for l(wiSaver; 92% of all responclents to the Colmar Brunton surveyts (both I(iwiSaver and non-l(iwiSaver rnembers) were aware of the kick-start. Fayments for the last 12 months to February 201 I totalled $354.6m. 31. With a projected increase in KiwiSaver membership of approximately 300,000 members over the next four years, there would be f,rscal savings to be rnade in removing or reducing the kick-start incentive. However, this could damage l(iwiSaver's attractiveness to uew members. There is a strong psychotogical boost attachecl with such an early initial increase in a tnember's tìnds ancl, on balance, the potential clamage to public perception and to the initial attractiveness of Kiwisaver outweighs the diminishing value of fiscal savings made by reducing or rernoving the iconic kick-star.t payment. 32' The Savings Working Group recommended a gradual 'clrip-feecl' of kick-start paytnents, to be matcl-red to members" contributions. However this would have minimal effect on costs, reduce the immecliate psychological boost of a $\[,000 incentive and woulcl effectively rnake this payment a duplication of MTCs, which are intencled to encourage regular contributions. t5 ibi,l, png" 3. ü0) 33. Removing or detaying payment of the kick-start to those uncler eighteen was also considered. The 2010 tîwisaver Evctlucttion, conducted by Inland Revenue's Evaluation Servicel6, identifiecl that among those parents who had enrolled their children, the Government kick-start contribution \\,vas the most colnmon reason providecl; 83 percent said this was a factor in enrolling their children, while 34 percent said this was the most impoftant factor in their decision. However, the value of accounts for most under eighteens is relatively low; a large numbers of children's accounts appear to holcl nothing more than the $1,000 kick-start, indicating that this practice is cloing little or nothing to raise private savings ancl encourage a savings habit via I(iwiSaver. 34. There are therefore potentially some fiscal savings from clelaying the payment of the kick-start for under-eighteens, for example, until their eighteenth birlhday. However, such a change would add to the complexity of l(iwiSaver, ancl yet the overall fiscal savings are likely to be minimal. Any I(wiSaver changes targeted at only this age group should form part of any wider consideration of how to boost savings levels for young people, and install good savings habits from a young age. Chunging IfiwiSaver íncentíves: Employer superøn,xuøtìon contríbution tax exemptíon 35. Ernployer contributions (cumently up to 2o/o of employee remuneration) to employee KiwiSaver accounts and complyir-rg superannuation funds are presently exernpt from ESCT. The exemption is estimated to cost the Government about $l75million a year in revenue forgone.36. The Savings Working Group recommencled that the existing exemption from ECST be removed; by its nature it is ahnost invisible to I(iwiSaver members, and so is the least-value of the incentives in terms of raising levels of private saving. It is also the rnost regressive of the I(iwiSaver subsidies, since those in higher tax bands get a proportionately greater benefit; 50 percent of the benefit goes to the top 15 percent of earners. Officials also recommend removing this exemption on similar grounds. 37, As part of removing the exemption, however, consideration should be given to how ESCT is computed on employers' contributions. The legislation currently gives two main methods to calculate ESCT. The default rnethocl allows ernployers to decluct ESCT at a flat rate of 33% from eligible superannuation contributions, while the "progressive scale" method allows lower ESCT rates to be appliecl to employers' superannuation contributions in relation to each inclividual's previous year's salary, wage ancl sLlperannuation contribution levels. 38. lnland Revenue's administrative clata is insufficient to iclentify which methods are usecl by ernployers. However, although it is recognisecl that the default rnethod is sirnpler for employers to apply ancl so reduces compliance costs, it does mean that lower-income employees who are affectecl will be more heavily taxecl than they woulcl be the case comparecl to the "progressive scale" methocl and compared to the rate at which their salary or wages are taxed. This results in less money going into their superalìnuation accounts. 39. It is tlierefore proposed to require alI ernployers to use the progressive scale systern at the same time as removing the ESCT exemption. This shoulcl not be a particularly difficult change for ernployers using commercial payroll systems that already have this functionality. l6 K¡tvisctvcr Evuluution Repon2010,\[nlanrl Rcveuue Evaluation Selviccs, t'or lnlanct Revenue, lvf inistryolEconornic Developrncnt ancl \[-\[ousirrg Ner.v Zealancl Cor¡ror.ation, Septernber 20 10, page 12. For ease, the timing of the change should be matchecl to the annual payroll cycle ( I April 2012). Employers prepaling rnanual payrolls will need to inclucle an additional calculation for ESCT when calculating KiwiSaver contribution amounts. Inland Revenue guidance, calculators and calculation tables will be available to assist with this. Encourage increased levels of private household saving Increasing membersltip: Compulsory versus voluntary 40. SWG and Government officials considered the impacts of KiwiSaver becorning a compulsory scheme. Variations included compulsion for employees only, with compulsory contributions deducted from pay; compulsion for all eligible adults; or compulsion for aclults over a ceftain age or fi'om a particular incorne level. This would also require changes to the cument settings for "contribution holiclays". The point of compulsion woulcl otherwise be negated by the ability of members to choose not to contribute. Issues regarding market fees and investment strategy would need to be fully resolved in advance of any element of compulsion being introducecl, 41. The present lGwiSaver model, although available to non-employees, is primarily rnarketed ancl designecl as a rvork-based voluntary superannuation savings scheme. For a universal enrolment, as well as new enrolment mechanisms for those outsicle the employed workforce, new contribution rnodels would neecl to be introducecl to require ancl collect savings contributions fi'om non-employecl persons. Sirnilar issues arose if compulsion was linked solely to age or income levels. 42. Cornpulsion for all employees, building on the existing I(wiSaver design, woulcl therefore be more ptactical than a univelsal enrolment. It is estimated that KiwiSaver membership would increase b1'an estirnated 730,000; the impact on national savings depends in part on other KiwiSaver serttings, such as the contribution rate and Crown incentives, but would be expected to be positive. 43. However Inland Revenua and officials frorn the Treasury consicler that these benefits I(iwiSaver need to be weighed against the welfare costs for people at the lower end of the income clistribution scale, who may be forced to recluce their spending on essential items in the present time in order to increase their income in retirement. The SWG considered the same point, and referrecl to thi,c in their report as "timing costs".t7 44. The SWG also noted that compulsion to save into l(iwiSaver has a "portfolio cost'\] in that it f'orces some people to invest in superannuation when they would rather invest in sornething else, such as housitrg, an enterprise business, or in a savings scheme that provides earlier access to funcls, such as for eclucation purposes. The Retirement Commission also recommended against compulsion. | 8 45. Treasury modelling also indicates that, following compulsion, 30 percent oî any new savings would be expectecl to come flrorn 60 percent of new mernbers, each earning less than $40,000. This suggests that the increase in national saving is unlikely to be justified by the negative irnpact ou present welfare for such low eamers, who are themselves unlikely to value the benefits in terms of increasecl consurnption later over decreasecl consumption now. l7 SWC' Suvitrg New Zertkutrl,op. cit. ¡rar.a 7.33. l8 http://ruw\*.retiretnent.org.nzlr'etilernent-incorne-resealoh/policy-review/20 l0-review. t2 46. Linking compulsion f'ot employees to wage levels or age were possible variations uncler this option that might have helpecl to alleviate some of the concerns over both "timing costs" and "portfolio costs" for savers. However, these variations would acld to the complexity of ICr,viSaver, and create additional compliance requirements for employers. 47. On balance, the modest increase in national savings that could be expected from introducing compulsion was outweighecl by the harmful welfare impacts on some groups of people, ancl the increase in fiscal costs if the l(iwiSaver subsidies were retained, even in a reduced form, Further, a move towards compulsion now was unlikely to be able to be readily reversed in future if it no longer aligned with the Government's longer term savings and investment plans. Increusing membershíp: enrolment exercìse (with optìon to opt out) 48. Some increase in I(iwiSaver membership could neveftheless still be delivered through existing mechanisms, if the increase is targeted to attract the people most likely to continue to contribute. Employees are the prime rnarket; behavioural analysis inclicates that there is a strong "inertia" factor for contributions by this group, which is assistecl by the automatic cleduction of contributions frorn source. 49. lnland Revenue comrnissioned Colmar Brunton to unclertake a survey to assess the outcomes of l(iwisaver for individuals. Colmar Brunton reported in July 2010'0. Inter alia, the survey asked respondents why they hacl not become members of l(wiSaver:28Yo had not got round to joining, while a fbrther 130lo wanted more information about I(iwisaver. This could indicate that, of the employecl population who are not alreacly members of l(iwisaver, over a third would not be averse to joining ancl so would be likely to remain a member if automatically enrollecl by their employer. 50. Officials therefore considered a one-off enrolment for all employees who are not already members of l(iwiSaver or a complying superannuation scheme. The exercise would provide employees the option to opt out before being enrollecl in l(wiSaver by their employer. Such an exercise was estimated to deliver up to 330,000 new members. This differs from the SWG recommendation of a one-off exercise using the current auto-enrolment process, by avoiding the significant compliance ancl administration costs for employers to rnake deductions from wages, which are later refunded by Inland Revenue where ernployees subsequently opt out. Even so, there would be costs to employers, both in running the exercise ancl in increased employer contributions for new mernbers. 51. Such an increase in I(iwisaver population would also significantly increase the fiscal costs, both in the short tetm through higher kick-start payrnents ($330 million in the f,rrst year) and ongoing through the MTC (arouncl $100 miltion per year), Given the key objective to recluce f,tscal costs, this was not regarcled as the appropriate time to consider running such an exercise. 52, The SWG suggested that the immediate irnpact of tl-re increased kick-start payments could by managed down by spreading payrnent over five years. However, this would have a limitecl effect on the overall ftscal cost and woulcl have negative incentive irnpacts, The $1,000 kick-start is highly successtul 'recognition' feature for l(iwiSaver; 92o/o of all respondents to the Cohnar Brunton survey20 (both I(wiSaver ancl non-KiwiSaver members) lt) Col,no, Brurrton Kiwisrtver Evctluutictn, op. ci: 20 ibi,l. png" 3 l3 were aware of kick-start, cornpared to only 58% who knew about member tax credits (MTCs). The spreacling method would have to be applied to all new rnernbers, not just those enrollecl as part of the exercise; it would therefore reduce the attractiveness of the kick-start payrnent in encouraging members to join in future, Increasìng contríbutíons: íncreusing deføult contributíon røte for uuto-enrolled employees 53. The "default contribution ratd' is the rate at which employees who are automatically enrollecl into I(iwiSaver by their employers will start contributing, unless they actively choose a rate. The default rate now stancls atZYo of wages. However, of those joining before 1 April 2009, when the default employee contribution rate was 4o/o,75 percent of members are still contributing at least 4o/o; that is, they did not take advantage of the introduction of the 2o/o miuimum rate from 1 April 2009. Only 20 percent of members joining on or after 1 April 2009, when the default rate',vas se| aIT%o, have actively chosen a higher rate. 54. Thus, for many rnembers, the default rate at which they start making I(iwisaver contributions governs the level of on-going contributions ("set and forget"). However, those employees who have chosen to move to a lower contribution late have tended to be lower- income. This suggests that affordability does have some influence, since the cap on Government contributions means that incentives are already stronger for low income members to contribute at above-minimum levels; and that 4Yo may be too high for some members. Increøsing contributíons: ìncreasìng compulsory employer contríbtttíon rute 55. Cornpulsory ernployer contributions both increase individual final accumulations ancl, especially if rnatched to employee contributions, are a strong way to encourage individuals to save towards retirernent, Witli the exception of higher-paicl executives where retirement contributions are a key part of a total remuneration package, rnany employees clo not traditionally regard their ernployerso contributions as deductions tiom "their" wages, even though the additional cost to employers fi'om making contributions is likely eventually to find its way through to lower wages (ir-rcluding for those not members of KiwiSaver). 56. At present, the minimum employer contribution is ZYo of employee wages. The rate was originally set at lo/o with the intention that this should increase by I percentage point each yeal until it reached 4o/o, bur. it lvas capped at 2o/o in 2008. Internationally, employers traclitionally contribute at much higher levels; for example, the Australian scheme involves an employer oontribution rate of 9%, 57. \[u contrast to ernployee contributions, where many employees are contributing above the 2o/o minimum rate, 90 percent of ernployer contributions are macle at 2o/o. A requirement for ernployers to raise their minimurn contribution woulcl therefore make a fairly signif,rcant impact on total Kir,viSaver accumulations. 58. Higl-rer employer contributions would increase labour costs in the short term. A delayed or staged introcluction of an iucreasecl minimurn rate for employer aontributions (either with or without an etnployee matchiLrg requirernent) would better enable employers to prepare for and manage these changes alongsicle other business costs. In the longer term higher contributions are likely to be reflected in lower wage settlements, hut this impact should be limited as the labour market ancl nominal wage growth are expected to strengther-r fi'om the encl of 201 I . l4 59. tf the requirement were that ernployets should raise their own contributions only where ernployees contribute above the minimum rate, it would reinforce the incentive for ernployees to raise, or maintain, their own contribution rates. However, the well-clocumented power of inertia raises the risk that many employees woulcl still take no action and leave contribution rates unchanged even though they could afford and woulcl derive greater benefits from a higher rate. Where subsidies are reduced as set out above, such employees, who are most likely to be in the lower income bracket, would see reductions in both their ernployer contributions (because of removal of the ESCT exemption) and in the Govemrnent's MTC contribution. Making the increased employer contributions dependent on voluntary action by individual members may therefore mean that rnany lower-income members see no inclividual benefit. \[ncreusìng co ntributío ns : íncreasìng mìnim ttm employee co ntrìb utío n rüte 60. Increasing the curent minimum employee contribution rate would increase the amounts of employee savings. It would also move some way to address the risk that the current 2o/o minimum and clefault rate setting sencls the wrong message regarcling the appropriate level of savings that individuals shoulcl be making in order to provicle an adequate retirement income. 61. Tl-ris must be weighed against the "timing costs" for people at the lower end of the income distribution scale. A higher minimum contribution effectively increases the price of contributing to l(wiSaver. People who cannot afford to contribute a revisecl minimum would be forcecl onto contributions holidays or never join in the first place, thus missing out on Government and employer contributions. So a very sharp inclease in the minirnum contribution rate may not deliver very much by way of additional householcl savings. 62. Allowing an adclitional 3Yo employee contribution rate, between the existing 2% minimum and the next optional contribution rate of 4Yo could be a helpful option for some members. Matching employer conttibutions at higher rates would reinforce the incentive for employees to contribute more where they can, and help to ensure that there is little rnovernent frorn employees the other way (that is, downwards to 3%). However, the risk of down- shifting may not actually be very high, given that employees on 4o/o akeady have the option to reduce their contribution rates, and the adclitional cost to employers may not tl'rerefore be justifiable. The additional costs to both Inland Revenue and ernployers of introducing this fuither option would be very moclest, as woulcl be the introcluction of furthel contribution rates, f'or example 5Yo,6Yo etc. 63. Nevertheless, from the point of view of the individual l(iwiSaver member there is a strong ir-rterest in keeping the scheme as sirnple and clear as possible; and in serving the interests of those who take no action. The adclition of further options which require active clecision making on the part of members and which many are likely to ignore anyway, even though they could benefrt from them, woulcl work against that objective. Members who are keen to engage rnore fully can always make voluntary contributions to increase their final accumulations ancl (for those on lower incomes) Member Tax Credit receipts. l5 \[ncreusirtg contributiotts: ntinor chutge optiorts 64, Other more minor change options tl-rat were consiclered but not recommendecl f'or the Buclget 201 I package are summarised below: Option Lowering rninimurncontribution rate to lo/, Comment Consideled alongside cornpulsion.

Officials have recommended that the proposed changes to the ESCT and the Member. Tax Credit should be included in Budget night legislation which will go through all the stages in the House in a single Parliamentary day. This is to allow suffìcient time for implernentation, both for employers ancl Inland Revenue. 75. The removal of both the ESCT exemption and the 33%:o flaI-rate calculation method would come into effect on 1 April 2012. This is to tie in with the starl of the tax year and so take advantage of the various updates to payroll systems and employer information leaflets that are alreacly schecluled to be macle at that date. 76. The proposed changes to reducing the MTC matching rate to 50c per $l mernber contribution, and reclucing the maximum annual MTC payment to $52 L43 (half of the present level), would take place with effect from I July 2011, being the 20l1lI2MTC claim year. Most MTC claims are macle after the year-end, which gives providers and Inland Revenue ovet 12 mouths to prepare for the changes before the bulk of the 20l|ll2 payments are macle. As the proposed changes clo not directly affect the claims process, the cornpliance costs would be expected to be relatively minirnal. 77 . The proposed increase to 3Yo for the compulsory ernployer contribution rate and for the default and minimum employee contribution rates would come into effect on 1 April 2013. Tl-re delayed start of this change means that it can be inclucled within a normal taxation bill, enabling interested parties to be consulted on design aspects, 78. The proposals fot a one-off enrolment exercise would be cliscussed with employers, payroll providers and other interestecl pafties. This would explore both the expected costs and benefits to each party, ancl possible design rnoclels for such an exercise. TVIONITORING, EVALUATTON AND REVIEW 79.

It provides an analysis of options for updating the tax minimum equity rules for foreign- owned banks, to reflect changes in the commercial and regulatory banking environment, and ensure that the appropriate amount of tax is paid in New Zealand. The existing rules envisage regular review, taking into account changes in regulatory and market practice to ensure an appropriate allocation of equity and debt to New Zealand. Therefore, our analysis has been confined to a review of whether (because of changes in the regulatory and commercial environment) the tax minimum equity ratio for foreign-owned banks should be raised from its current percentage, rather than an overarching review of the use of a tax minimum equity ratio. The analysis and consultation undertaken as part of our review has been subject to time constraints in order to meet Budget 2011 deadlines. In keeping with the established process in this area, consultation has been undertaken with the New Zealand Bankers' Association, and with some other individual banks. A key concern raised during consultation was that any increase in the minimum equity percentage should be made on a principled basis, and not merely to raise revenue. If this is not the case, it would imply that the percentage could be increased any time that the Government needed money. This perception would have ramifications for the financing structures that banks would use over the longer term and, therefore, on the cost of capital. The consultation undertaken has informed both the setting of the appropriate ratio and the transitional approach. We carried out our review in conjunction with the Treasury, and the Treasury supports our conclusions and recommendations. We also consulted the Reserve Bank of New Zealand throughout our review process. Their independent analysis of our modelling supports the conclusions we reach. Any increase in the tax minimum equity ratio for foreign-owned banks would be likely to impose additional tax costs on foreign-owned banks. However, we believe that the increased tax costs are justified, as our analysis shows that the amount of tax currently being paid in New Zealand by foreign-owned banks does not fairly reflect the economic reality of their banking business in New Zealand. Moreover, these increased tax costs in New Zealand would be substantially offset by reduced tax costs overseas. There are also likely to be transitional costs for banks in restructuring their balance sheets (for example, by converting existing tax debt into tax equity) to meet the proposed requirements. However, ongoing compliance costs are minimised, as banks already have systems in place for monitoring their tax equity position under the current rules. 1 Any increase in the tax minimum equity ratio for foreign-owned banks may reducc the incentives for those banks to invest in New Zealand. However, our analysis shows that our recommended option would not materially influence these incentives. None of the policy options would impair private property rights, restrict market competition, or override fundamental common law principles. Dr Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 28 March 2011 2 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The problem addressed in this Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) is the setting of the appropriate tax minimum equity ratio for foreign-owned banks. The setting of this ratio is important for ensuring that foreign-owned banks pay an appropriate amount of tax in New Zealand. 2. Currently, foreign-owned banks operating in New Zealand are subject to a special form of thin capitalisation rule. This rule was introduced in 2005 and requires the New Zealand banking group to hold equity equal to at least 4% of its New Zealand risk-weighted exposures (RWEs). The rule prevents banks from using structures that allow excessive interest deductions against the New Zealand tax base. 3. New Zealand incorporated banks are also subject to prudential regulatory requirements, which prescribe the minimum levels of capital they must hold, to protect against insolvency in the event of bad loans or other unexpected losses. This capital is split into "tiers", with Tier 1 capital consisting of the capital that is closest in nature to ordinary share capital. The minimum Tier 1 capital ratio is currently also 4% of RWEs. Tax equity and Tier 1 capital are generally defined in the same way, with similar instruments (such as common equity) being included in both. However, there are a number of important technical differences, which must be borne in mind when comparing the tax and regulatory amounts of equity. 4. The prudential requirements are based on the "Basel" frameworks, which are applied in many countries. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has recently recommended an increase in the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio to 6%, as part of a number of changes proposed under the Basel III framework. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will be consulting with the banks regarding the implementation of Basel III in New Zealand. The New Zealand Bankers' Association (NZBA) expects an increase from 4% to 6% to occur, and that this will happen sometime between January 2013 and January 2015. 5. As illustrated in the following graph, in recent times (post-financial crisis of 2008), the banks operating in New Zealand have been maintaining higher Tier 1 capital levels than they were pre-financial crisis. Selected Industry Averages 12% 4% •• 2% - — - —— 0% ! 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Awrage Her 1 capital ratio for banks which operate in New Zealand forlhier worldwide business Average Tier 1 capital ratio of Australian Banks (ANZ, CBA, NAB & Weslpac) for their worldwide business Awrage Her 1 capital ratio of NZ incorporated registered banks with an Australian parent (ANZ National, ASB, BNZ, Westpac) - - - Average Her 1 capital ratio of NZ incorporated registered banks with an Australian parent (calculated under Basel II) Aierage Tax capital ratio of 5 banks - Representative of where we have observed the banking industry 3 6. This increase is partly explained by the anticipation of higher prudential regulatory ratios, but officials understand that there has also been a fundamental reassessment by markets of the amount of capital that financial institutions must hold. 7. However, as also illustrated on the above graph, the average tax equity ratio has remained close to the prescribed minimum of 4% of RWEs. The primary reason why the average tax equity ratio has remained relatively stable, while average Tier 1 capital ratios have been increasing, is the use of holding company structures in New Zealand. Holding company structures are ignored for New Zealand regulatory purposes but are included for tax purposes. This allows the operating bank (the prudentially regulated entity) to be equity funded by the holding company, while the holding company is partially funded by debt. This enables the holding company to take interest deductions on a portion of the "capital" and thereby pay less tax in New Zealand. OBJECTIVES 8. The desired Government outcomes are to ensure that: • the amount of tax paid in New Zealand by foreign-owned banks reflects the economic reality of their banking business in New Zealand, and • there is continued stability in the banking sector in New Zealand. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 9. The existing rules envisaged regular review, taking into account changes in regulatory and market practice to ensure an appropriate allocation of equity and debt to New Zealand. Therefore, the options considered do not involve an overarching review of the use of a tax minimum equity ratio to prevent excessive interest deductions against the New Zealand tax base. Instead, the review focuses on whether, because of changes in the regulatory and commercial environment, the tax minimum equity ratio for banks should be raised from its current level of 4% and, if so, to what level. Consequently, the options considered in this RIS are different tax minimum equity percentages and transitional approaches. New threshold options 10. The following table outlines a range of tax minimum equity percentages that could be chosen. For each of these thresholds, the table shows the additional capital that would be required in aggregate by foreign-owned banks, the aggregate reduction in interest deduction, and the estimated increased tax revenue per annum resulting from the increased equity. All of these figures assume that the banks would hold a 0.5 percentage point buffer over the threshold. 4 New Threshold Actual % Equity Held Additional Capital Required ($ million) Reduction in Interest Deduction ($ million) Increased Tax per annum ($ million 4.5% 5.0% 34 2 0 5.0% 5.5% 556 28 8 5.5% 6.0% 1,391 70 19 6.0% 6.5% 2,225 111 31 6.5% 7.0% 3,060 153 43 7.0% 7.5% 3,894 195 55 8.0% 8.5% 5,781 289 81 11. In setting the percentage in 2005, worldwide Tier 1 capital ratios were taken as a starting point. At the time, worldwide Tier 1 ratios were, on average, 7% to 8% for the main banks. This was then discounted to take account of surplus capital held by the parent banks, non-bank business equity, and the use of hybrid instruments (equity-like debt instruments). This took the rate to less than 6%. 12. However, other factors were also taken into account, which further lowered the appropriate percentage. These factors included the potential for disruption to the banking industry if further capital was required to support the New Zealand business, robustness over the business cycle and across different banks in different commercial situations, and the fit with the broader trans-Tasman relationship and the economic and revenue impacts. 13. It was also felt that the use of an external statutory benchmark would avoid the perception of arbitrariness that could attach to a percentage that had no such linkage. As such, it reduced the potential uncertainty for the banks as to the future tax consequences of their long-term financing decisions. 14. In the end, it was decided that on balance a ratio of 4% was appropriate, the same as the regulatory minimum. 15. The considerations taken into account in setting the percentage in 2005 remain relevant today. For comparisons with the tax minimum equity ratio, the relevant regulatory equity concept is Tier 1 capital held by the consolidated Australian banks. Tier 1 capital levels currently average over 8.5%, and have been growing over the last 24 months. Tier 1 capital levels for the New Zealand incorporated banks average over 9%. However, some instruments that would not be included in equity for tax purposes are included in the regulatory capital, so these figures are not directly comparable to the tax minimum equity percentage. To the extent to which such instruments give rise to tax deductions, they are already excluded from equity for purposes of the minimum equity calculation in New Zealand. Accordingly, the above 5 figures would need to be adjusted downward for comparative purposes. Overall, the increase in capital has raised capital ratios by 1 to 1V\* percentage points from 2005 levels. 16. The regulatory requirements are likely to change in the near future, following a process of consultation between the RBNZ and the banking industry. As noted above, the NZBA expects that the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio will be increased from its current level of 4% to 6%, an increase of 2 percentage points. This increase has been anticipated and banks are already preparing for it, holding more than the current regulatory minimum even though the financial crisis has eased. 17. Based on these increases, applying the policy parameters underlying the 2005 decisions would imply an increase in the minimum equity percentage of between 1 and 2 percentage points. Given the advantages of basing the tax percentage on the regulatory percentage, our preferred option is an increase in the tax minimum equity percentage to 6%. 18. Setting the tax minimum equity percentage for foreign-owned banks above the regulatory minimum has been considered, but is not recommended by officials, particularly because of the increased likelihood that banks' regulatory capital would be insufficient to meet the tax requirement at these higher levels. As well as potentially creating practical problems for banks in obtaining additional tax capital, a higher tax minimum equity percentage may have an appearance of arbitrariness. This could suggest to foreign-owned banks that the percentage may again be increased at any time in the future as a revenue raising measure, which could be destabilising to the banking industry in New Zealand. 19. The wider economic impact of increasing the tax minimum equity percentage must also be considered. We have carried out modelling of the effect of increasing the tax minimum equity ratio on banks' cost of capital or the cost of borrowing in New Zealand. Our modelling shows that a rise in the threshold to 6% would have only a minimal impact, requiring a rise in lending interest rates of less than 2 basis points in order to maintain shareholder returns. The primary reason that the impact on lending costs in New Zealand would not be significant is because the increased tax in New Zealand would be substantially offset by reduced tax in Australia. Transitional options 20. As Ministers wished to announce any increase in the tax minimum equity percentage as part of their Budget 2011 package, options considered included application from either: • 1 July 2011 • 1 April 2012, or • at the same time as the anticipated changes under Basel III. 21. Regarding transitional approaches, officials considered both a one-off rise and a staggered rise to the chosen new threshold. A staggered approach would involve increasing the tax minimum equity percentage incrementally over a specified timeframe until it reached the desired level. A myriad of permutations would be possible due to the number of variables involved (including the desired eventual new threshold, and the length of time over which the staggering would occur). Staggering would mean that the aggregate additional capital required by foreign-owned banks would increase incrementally. 22. The following table provides an example of the use of a staggered rise to a new threshold. It illustrates the effects of a staggered rise of the tax minimum equity threshold 6 from 4% to 6% from 1 July 2011 to 31 March 2013. The threshold is increased in six- monthly increments of 0.5 percentage points over the period. For each quarter, the table shows the aggregate additional capital required, the reduction in interest deduction, and the estimated increase in tax. The increased tax is then aggregated for fiscal years. Quarter Ended New Threshold Actual % Equity Held Additional Capital Required ($ million) Reduction in Interest Deduction ($ million) Increased Tax ($ million) Annual Tax Increase Year ended 30 June($ million) 30-Sep-2011 4.5% 5.0% 34 0 0 30-Jun-2012 4 31-Dec-2011 4.5% 5.0% 34 0 0 30-Jun-2012 4 31-Mar-2012 5.0% 5.5% 556 7 2 30-Jun-2012 4 30-Jun-2012 5.0% 5.5% 556 7 2 30-Jun-2012 4 30-Sep-2012 5.5% 6.0% 1,391 17 5 30-Jun-2013 25 31-Dec-2012 5.5% 6.0% 1,391 17 5 30-Jun-2013 25 31-Mar-2013 6.0% 6.5% 2,225 28 8 30-Jun-2013 25 All subsequent quarters 6.0% 6.5% 2,225 28 8 30-Jun-2013 25 All subsequent years 31 23. As mentioned above, there are myriad permutations of using a staggered approach to raising the tax minimum equity percentage. The above table is but one example. However, it allows for some general observations to be made. Use of the staggered approach means that the annual increase in tax paid rises gradually over the transitional period. Therefore, the longer the transitional period, the longer before the annual estimated increase in Crown revenue reaches its maximum. 24. The use of a staggered approach makes more sense the nearer in time the application date of the new tax minimum equity requirements is. The further away in time the application date is, the more sense it makes to just have a one-off increase in the tax minimum equity percentage, as banks would have more time to convert debt into equity. 25. When considering what the application date should be, officials were mindful that the banks would need sufficient time to make the necessary adjustments to their balance sheets. This may involve the conversion of existing tax debt into tax capital. For some banks, this debt is long-term third party debt. 26. When officials decided on a threshold of 6% as their preferred option, the decision as to the implementation approach became easier. The higher the new threshold, the more time banks would need to make the necessary adjustments, which would influence our choice of preferred implementation approach. A later application date and/or use of a staggered 7 approach would be more appropriate the greater the rise in the threshold. At the relatively small rise to 6%, particularly with a later application date, we considered that staggering was unnecessary. 27. For a new threshold of 6%, our preferred option would be an application date of 1 April 2012 without staggering. This approach (which would give banks until 30 June 2012 to bring in any additional capital required) would allow banks a reasonable amount of time to make the required adjustments, and would also allow for the legislation to go through the full Parliamentary process, including the Select Committee stage. 28. This approach would be expected to raise approximately $8 million of additional tax revenue in the 2011/12 fiscal year and $31 million in each subsequent fiscal year, as per the following table: $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue 8.000 31.000 31.000 31.000 29. For a new threshold of 6%, we also considered an application date of 1 July 2011 without staggering. This approach would be expected to raise approximately $31 million of additional tax revenue in the 2011/12 fiscal year, and the same in each subsequent fiscal year, as per the following table: $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue 31.000 31.000 31.000 31.000 30. Although this approach would raise more revenue in the 2011/12 fiscal year, officials do not recommend this approach, because of the short notice it would give the banks, and the potential problems some banks may face in quickly making the necessary adjustments to their balance sheets. Also counting against this approach is the fact that it would not allow for the legislation to go through the full Parliamentary process. 31. We also considered an application date coinciding with the expected implementation of Basel III in New Zealand. Such an approach would mean that it would take longer before tax revenue increased. We do not recommend this approach, as we consider that the tax minimum equity rules have a different purpose to the regulatory rules and, therefore, an explicit linkage in application date is not appropriate. Officials' view is that the tax minimum equity ratio is already too low at present, given the level of Tier 1 capital currently being held by banks. 8 CONSULTATION Banking industry consultation 32. In late October 2010, officials wrote to the affected banks, advising them that the Government intended to explore some issues with the minimum equity rules for banks—in particular, whether the current 4% threshold for minimum equity was still the appropriate percentage. We indicated in our letter that we wanted to get their input into any possible changes, and that we would be in contact with them to see if they wanted to meet to discuss the issues. 33. In November 2010, Inland Revenue and Treasury officials released an issues paper on banking minimum equity, for the purposes of consultation between the banking industry and tax policy officials. 34. In early December 2010, officials again wrote to affected banks. Officials set out, in more detail, the issues with the existing bank minimum equity rules, and asked the banks for their feedback on the following questions: • Do you agree that the gap between actual capital and tax capital was widened? • Do you consider a 20% discount to take account of surplus capital, hybrids and other non-banking business to be a useful rule of thumb? • What would you consider the impact of increasing the minimum equity ratio to the range of 7% to 8% would be in terms of capital and tax paid at the New Zealand entity and banking group level? Would there be any other impacts? • If the rules were to be changed, what would your expectations be regarding transitional arrangements? • Are there any other issues which you believe should be taken into account? 35. Further correspondence was exchanged and meetings were held between officials and the NZBA, and some other individual banks, between late November 2010 and late February 2011. 36. As a result of this consultation, the NZBA raised a number of issues, including the impact on the cost of capital and the perceived stability of the New Zealand taxing environment as banks make long-term financial commitments to New Zealand. 37. The NZBA's key concern was that any increase in the minimum equity percentage should be made on a principled basis, and not merely to raise revenue. If this is not the case, it would imply that the percentage could be increased any time that the Government needed money. This perception would have ramifications for the financing structures that banks would use over the longer term and, therefore, on the cost of capital. Accordingly, the NZBA suggested that the tax minimum equity requirement be linked explicitly with the minimum regulatory requirement. 38. The banks have also expressed concerns about the level at which the tax minimum equity percentage is set. The strong message is that any increase above 6% would be problematic for banks. 39. Another key concern expressed by banks was about the timing of the changes to the tax minimum equity requirements. They emphasised that it will take time for banks to put extra tax capital into their New Zealand balance sheets. This is because it may involve converting 9 some of their existing tax debt (which for some banks is long-term third party debt) into tax capital. Banks have also suggested that the tax changes should coincide with the changes under Basel III. 40. Feedback received through consultation has helped officials in arriving at their preferred option. Officials' preferred option is for the change not to apply until the quarter beginning 1 April 2012, which would give banks until 30 June 2012 to bring in any additional capital required. Intra-governmental consultation 41. Inland Revenue officials have carried out their review of the tax minimum equity ratio for foreign-owned banks in New Zealand in conjunction with Treasury officials. The Treasury concurs with our conclusions and recommendations. 42. Officials have maintained close consultation with the RBNZ throughout the review process. 43. RBNZ officials have emphasised their position that the regulatory regime in New Zealand is not designed to provide protection for the New Zealand tax base. 44. RBNZ officials were also consulted about the potential impact on the banking sector of raising the tax minimum equity percentage. RBNZ officials concur with Inland Revenue modelling, which shows that an increase in the percentage to 6% is likely to have only a minimal impact on banks' cost of capital or the cost of borrowing in New Zealand. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 45. Officials recommend increasing the tax minimum equity percentage for foreign-owned banks from 4% to 6% from 1 April 2012. 46. Officials do not recommend raising the tax minimum equity percentage any more than the increase in the regulatory minimum, particularly because of the increased likelihood that banks' regulatory capital would be insufficient to meet the tax requirement at these higher levels. 47. This option allows banks sufficient time to organise the extra capital required, which was a major concern raised by banks during consultation. IMPLEMENTATION 48. The proposed option, which requires legislative change, would be included in the August 2011 Bill. This would allow the legislation to go through the whole Parliamentary process, including the Select Committee stage. The change would apply for the quarter beginning 1 April 2012, which would give banks until 30 June 2012 to bring in any additional capital required. 49. We expect any additional administrative costs to be minimal, as the proposal involves only a change to the existing tax minimum equity percentage for a small group of taxpayers. Monitoring of the level of tax paid and banks' compliance with the rules already occurs. 10 50. Banks are expected to incur initial compliance costs in restructuring their balance sheets (for example, by converting existing tax debt into tax equity) to meet the proposed requirements. 51. Ongoing compliance costs are minimised, as banks already have systems in place for monitoring their tax equity position under the current rules. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 52. In general, Inland Revenue's monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would generally be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 53. We would continue to monitor the tax equity ratio maintained by banks and the amount of tax paid in New Zealand. If it became apparent that the amount of tax being paid in New Zealand by foreign-owned banks no longer fairly reflected the economic reality of their banking business in New Zealand, we may revisit the tax minimum equity rules for foreign- owned banks, and any proposals for change would again go through the GTPP. 11 Regulatory Impact Statement Non-resident film renters' tax Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question in this Statement is whether the non-resident film renters' tax rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 are necessary and, if not, whether the rules should be replaced by non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). The non-resident film renters' tax was introduced in 1928 because of the difficulties in accurately determining the net profit derived by non-residents from renting out films in New Zealand. However, there is no longer a sound policy rationale for retaining the non-resident film renters' tax rules. Public consultation was undertaken as part of the Government discussion document, New Zealand's International Tax Review: a direction for change, released in December 2006 and three submissions were received on the proposal. Recently, officials have been in contact with the submitters about the proposed change and they raised no additional points to their submissions. Other than set out in this Disclosure Statement and the broader Regulatory Impact Statement, no significant gaps, assumptions, dependencies, constraints, caveats or uncertainties have been identified. In preparing this Statement, we have consulted with the Treasury, which agrees with our analysis. The proposed change may impose some compliance costs for New Zealand customers who make payments to non-resident film renters for renting and exhibiting film purposes in New Zealand. New Zealand customers would need to withhold tax for the non-resident film renters and some may potentially need to re-negotiate existing contracts and re-configure systems for the deduction of NRWT. But, overall and also in the long tenn, the change would simplify the New Zealand income tax rules applying to non-residents and reduce compliance costs on non-resident companies by removing their filing responsibility in New Zealand. The change does not affect the local film production industry. The proposed change does not impair private property rights, reduce market competition, provide disincentives to innovate and invest or override common law principles, Dr Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 2 June 2011 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. At present, 10 percent of the gross receipts derived by non-residents from renting out films in New Zealand are deemed to be assessable income under section CV 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Under section DW 3, a non-resident film renter is not allowed a deduction in relation to this income. The rate of tax that is applied is the rate of tax applicable to the non- resident. Because the non-resident is invariably a company, this means that non-resident film renters are generally subject to an effective tax rate of 2.8 percent on their gross receipts (i.e. 28 percent of 10 percent). 2. Income subject to this rule is not included in the income of the non-resident film renter under any other provision in the Act. Importantly, this income is excluded from the definition of non-resident passive income and is therefore not subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). 1 3. The rule for taxing non-resident film renters has existed in various forms since 1928. The rule was originally enacted because of the difficulties in accurately determining the net profit derived by non-residents from renting out films in New Zealand. Given NRWT is now well-established and could apply to such income, there is no longer a sound policy rationale for having separate tax rules for non-resident film renters. 4. This Statement considers whether the Income Tax Act should be amended to remove the separate tax rules for non-resident film renters. OBJECTIVES 5. The main objective is to review whether the existing non-resident film renters' tax rules are necessary and, if not, whether the rules should be replaced by NRWT. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 6. The options that we have identified are to retain the status quo or to repeal the provisions relating to non-resident film renters' tax so that NRWT applies to amounts derived by non-resident film renters. 7. The non-resident film renters' tax is an historical anachronism. It appears that the non- resident film renters' tax was not replaced in 1964 when NRWT was introduced because of the 1948 double tax agreement (DTA) between United States and New Zealand. That DTA prevented New Zealand taxing the income of United States film renters except to the extent allowed under the existing non-resident film renters' tax. The 1982 DTA between New Zealand and the United States (replacing the 1948 DTA) and the current DTA (in force from November 2010) contains no similar restriction on New Zealand's ability to tax income derived from New Zealand by the United States-resident film renters. 8. The preferred option is to repeal the existing provisions relating to non-resident film renters' tax so that NRWT could apply. This would rationalise and simplify the New Zealand income tax rules applying to non-residents and provide consistency with other tax treatments. 1 NRWT is a broad set of withholding taxes on interest, dividends and royalties derived from New Zealand by non-residents. 2 Also, this approach is in line with how other countries, such as Australia, tax amounts derived by non-resident film renters. 9. Practically all amounts subject to the non-resident film renters' tax would come within the royalty definitions in the Income Tax Act 2007 and in New Zealand's DTAs. Hence, such amounts would be subject to NRWT if non-resident film renters' tax is repealed.2 10. Under this option, NRWT at variable rates would apply in accordance with DTAs between New Zealand and other countries, which limit the amount of NRWT that New Zealand can charge on royalties. The DTA royalty rate is generally 10 percent. However, the rate under the United States and Australia DTAs is five percent, which would apply to many non-resident film renters. The NRWT rate of 15 percent applies if there is no applicable DTA. 11. This option will result in the following estimated increase in tax revenues, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance: $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 &outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue 5.000 5.000 5.000 12. No social, environmental or cultural costs are expected to arise under this option. Also, no significant behavioural changes by non-resident film renters are expected to arise. NRWT on film rental payments derived from New Zealand by non-residents would generally be creditable in the home country of the non-resident film renter. 13. There will be some compliance costs for New Zealand customers who make payments to non-resident film renters for renting or exhibiting film purposes in New Zealand. New Zealand customers will have to withhold tax for the non-resident film renters from the 2012-13 income year and may potentially re-negotiate existing contracts and re-configure systems for the deduction of NRWT. Because it involves making deductions from gross payments at a flat rate, NRWT is a relatively simple tax to comply with. Some non-resident film renters may also face increased compliance costs to re-negotiate existing contracts but this will be partially offset by the removal of filing responsibility in New Zealand. 14. The proposed change will not affect the local film production industry. CONSULTATION 15. Inland Revenue has consulted on the proposal as part of the government discussion document, New Zealand's International Tax Review: a direction for change, released in December 2006 and three submissions were received. The submitters raised a general 2 Note that certain types of receipts, which are currently subject to non-resident film renters' tax, would not be subject to NRWT (being outside the royalty definition). These are receipts from the sale or hire of film containers or other film accessories. However, the value of film containers or other accessories relative to the copyright in the film itself would be immaterial. The transfer pricing rules would prevent non-arm's length values being attributed to such accessories if film rental payments were subject to NRWT. 3 concern about an increased cost of film rental to New Zealand customers. These costs may include the increased tax burden on New Zealanders because of the existing contract conditions (for example, gross-up clauses) and the increased compliance costs on New Zealand customers to withhold tax for the non-resident film renters. Recently, officials have been in contact with the submitters about the proposed change and they raised no additional points to their submissions. 16. Officials have reviewed the submitters' concerns but consider the policy arguments for replacing the non-resident film renters' tax with NRWT are stronger. The change would simplify the New Zealand income tax rules applying to non-residents and, in particular, the burden of the increased tax will not necessarily be borne by New Zealanders because NRWT would generally be creditable in the home country of the non-resident film renter. 17. Inland Revenue has also consulted with the Treasury. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 18. The recommended option is to replace the non-resident film renters' tax with NRWT so that NRWT applies to amounts derived by non-residents from renting out films in New Zealand. IMPLEMENTATION 19. The necessary legislative change will be included in the scheduled September 2011 tax bill, with application to payments made on or after the date of enactment. 20. A small number of non-resident film renters would have a reduced compliance burden as a result of the removal of filing responsibility in New Zealand. Some New Zealand customers, who make payments to non-resident film renters for renting and exhibiting film purposes in New Zealand, would have to deduct and return NRWT from payments made to non-resident film renters. Some may need to register with Inland Revenue for NRWT. Because it involves making deductions from gross payments at a flat rate, NRWT is a relatively simple tax to comply with. 21. Inland Revenue intends to identify these New Zealand customers and target them with communications advising them of their new obligations, and what they need to do. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 22. The new tax treatment of the non-resident film renters would be part of any monitoring, evaluation and review of NRWT. If any specific concerns are raised, officials would determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process. The Income Tax Act 2007 is also subject to regular review by officials. 4 Regulatory Impact Statement Extending eligibility for the in-work tax credit to unpaid shareholder-employees in certain circumstances Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question in this Statement is whether unpaid shareholder-employees can be eligible for the in-work tax credit where they work the required number of hours per week. Currently, the in-work tax credit is only available to a shareholder-employee who works full-time and where they derive wages, salary or a shareholder salary. It is not available if they only derive dividends or other distributions from the company. The Statement provides an analysis of the options for extending eligibility to unpaid shareholder-employees. As the change concerns people who are currently ineligible, there is little information to indicate the number of people affected. Estimates have been made based on current administrative data and information gathered through consultation. The number affected is expected to be very low and also likely to vary between years due to economic conditions affecting business profitability. Other than set out in this Disclosure Statement and the broader Regulatory Impact Statement, no significant gaps, assumptions, dependencies, constraints, caveats or uncertainties have been identified. In preparing this Statement, we have consulted with the Treasury and the Ministry of Social Development, which agreed with our analysis. We have also discussed the issue and potential options with representatives of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants. The consultation informed the problem definition, development of options and analysis summarised in this Statement. The proposed change will not impose any significant new compliance costs on shareholder- employees seeking to apply for the in-work tax credit. The proposed change also does not impair private property rights, reduce market competition, provide disincentives to innovate and invest or override common law principles. Inland Revenue 19 July 2011 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. Where a person meets certain criteria they will be eligible for the in-work tax credit. The criteria include being a New Zealand resident, caring for a dependent child, not receiving an income-tested benefit or student allowance, working the minimum required number of hours a week and deriving income from that work activity. 2. Section MD 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007 requires the full time worker to be receiving specified income from the work activity. This specified income is defined to include wages and salary, shareholder salary and income from a business carried on for profit, as well as weekly ACC and parental leave payments in certain circumstances. 3. This requirement is not clearly stated on the application form leading to some applicants being unaware of the requirement for income to be derived from the work activity. Additional costs can be incurred by the department and applications in correcting applications. 4. Where all the criteria are met the person can apply for the in-work tax credit, which provides up to $60 a week where the family has up to three children, and an extra $15 a week for each additional child. The total amount, along with any family tax credit or parental tax credit, is abated against family scheme income. Family scheme income is defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 to include wages and salary, shareholder salary and business income. It also includes income attributed to people from trusts or companies in specific circumstances. 5. These criteria are intended to encourage people to move off income-tested benefits into work. It also encourages people to remain in work. 6. When a business makes a loss in a tax year, it may decide not to make a payment to the business owner relating to the owner's work activity. If the business owner is a sole trader, partner, shareholder of a look-through company, or beneficiary of a trading trust, they may still be eligible for the in-work tax credit as the gross income of the business can be treated as the person's income from a business. However, this treatment does not apply where the business is conducted via a company. A shareholder-employee will only qualify as receiving income from a work activity if they are paid wages or salary, or a shareholder salary. The gross income of the company is not treated as the person's income from a business for the purposes of the test in section MD 9. 7. In a number of situations, companies have elected to make no payment to the shareholder-employee due to the overall net loss of the company in that year. As a result, an unpaid shareholder-employee is not eligible for the in-work tax credit, even though they normally work the required number of hours per week. The number affected is estimated to be very low. 8. The current situation creates an inequity between working business owners based on the type of structure their business operates in. 9. An alternative could be for a shareholder-employee to receive a nominal payment, meaning they would meet the criterion of receiving income from a work activity. However, as this is an artificial construct it is likely to receive additional scrutiny from Inland Revenue with associated costs for the department and applicant. It would be preferable to address the problem directly. 40 10. The key cause of this situation is the inability for an unpaid shareholder-employee to meet the current legislative definition of income from a work activity. While the definition is sufficient for business owners in other entities, it does not cover shareholder-employees in standard companies. A non-legislative solution of the payment of a nominal salary is artificial and could result in greater scrutiny being applied to it with increased uncertainty and compliance costs for applicants. OBJECTIVES 11. The main objective is to ensure that the in-work tax credit operates as intended by encouraging people to move into and remain in work. It aims to support people with dependent children based on their level of work activity and their level of income. The question is whether the legislation setting out the eligibility criteria achieves the policy objectives. 12. In making changes to the eligibility rules, consideration should be given to government priorities to improve the integrity of the tax credits. Fiscal costs are also a consideration. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 13. The options that we have identified are to: Option A: provide further guidance to applicants and Inland Revenue staff about the requirements for income to be derived from work and the approach taken on nominal salary payments in light of the recent broadening of the definition of income. This would only clear some confusion on the current rules and would not extend eligibility to unpaid shareholder-employees. Option B: change the definition of "full-time earner deriving income from a work activity" to include major shareholder-employees of close companies that produce gross income, provided the person meets all other requirements. This would extend eligibility to unpaid shareholder-employees who meet all other requirements. 14. As noted, Option A does not address the inequity that has been identified, although it may reduce the uncertainty and compliance costs for some applicants. 15. The preferred option is Option B to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 to extend eligibility to major shareholder-employees of a close company, where the close company produces gross income and all other requirements are met. This addresses the inequity. 16. The preferred Option B will result in an estimated increase in expenditure on the in- work tax credit of approximately $0,650 million per year. The 2011-12 appropriation for the in-work tax credit is approximately $567 million. The estimated cost of the preferred option can be met within the existing appropriation. 17. Shareholder-employees affected by the proposed change will be required to confirm that they meet all the eligibility requirements when applying for the in-work tax credit. No social, environmental or cultural costs are expected to arise. CONSULTATION 18. Officials discussed the status quo and problem definition with representatives from the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, who provided information to inform the analysis. Indicative options were also discussed and the representatives did not support the 2 option to issue further guidance only. Feedback from the consultation was factored into the analysis and informed the development of the preferred option. 19. Inland Revenue has also consulted with the Treasury and the Ministry of Social Development, which agreed with our analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 20. The recommended option is to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 to change the definition of "full-time earner deriving income from a work activity" to include major shareholder- employees of close companies that produce gross income, provided the person meets all other requirements. This would ensure comparable treatment between major shareholder- employees and other working business owners. IMPLEMENTATION 21. The definition of family scheme income has been broadened from 1 April 2011 to improve its integrity. The broadened definition of family scheme income will reduce the risks associated with potential behavioural changes. In particular, section MB 4 attributes the net undistributed income of a close company to the major shareholders in proportion to their shareholding. Furthermore, section MB 7 attributes the income earned by a trust that is not paid out as beneficiary income to the settlors of the trust. This broadened definition of family scheme income ensures that Working for Family tax credits, including the in-work tax credit, are well targeted. 22. The necessary legislative change will be included in the tax bill scheduled to be introduced in September 2011, with effect from the 2012-13 tax year. 23. As the proposed option refers to existing definitions of major shareholders and close companies, it can be implemented within existing processes for changes to Working for Families. Administrative costs will be met within the Inland Revenue's existing baselines. No significant risks have been identified. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 24. The proposed change to eligibility will be monitored as part of business as usual processes on the take-up and expenditure of the in-work tax credit. 3 Regulatory Impact Statement Liquidators and receivers changing GST accounting basis Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question in this Statement is whether liquidators and receivers should be able to change from the payments to the invoice basis when accounting for GST. The main objective is to ensure that liquidators and receivers are not able to engage in tax driven behaviour to generate GST refunds to the detriment of the Government's tax base. Other than set out in this Disclosure Statement and the broader Regulatory Impact Statement, no significant gaps, assumptions, dependencies, constraints, caveats or uncertainties have been identified. Officials have consulted with the relevant industry body, INSOL, and the Treasury. Given the technical nature of the issue and its small stakeholder group, wider public consultation has not been undertaken. In preparing this Statement, we have consulted with the Treasury, which agrees with our analysis. The proposed change will not impose any compliance costs on liquidators or receivers. The proposed change does not impair private property rights, reduce market competition, provide disincentives to innovate and invest or override common law principles. Dr Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 20 July 2011 I STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The question in this Statement is whether liquidators and receivers should be able to change from the payments to the invoice basis when accounting for GST. 2. If a registered person meets certain conditions, for example, the total value of taxable supplies for a 12 month period has not, or is not likely to exceed $2,000,000, the registered person may account for GST on a payments basis. The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 allows registered persons who are accounting for GST on a payments basis to change to the invoice basis by applying to the Commissioner. There are currently no restrictions on registered persons making this accounting basis change. 3. The large majority of registered persons choose to account for GST on a payments basis because it suits their business needs. 4. It is normal practice for liquidators and receivers to switch the GST accounting basis of registered persons they are acting for from the payments basis to the invoice basis. Changing from the payments to the invoice basis often results in refunds being made to the liquidator or receiver despite in many cases there being no realistic prospect that the debt, to which the input credit relates, will ever be paid. Even though output tax is also recognised on an invoice basis when the accounting basis is switched, Inland Revenue's statistics show that liquidators and receivers consistently receive net refunds when they make the switch. 5. For example, in the period 1 January 2009 to 30 July 2010 there were 627 companies where the liquidators requested a change from the payments basis to the invoice basis - the amount of GST claimed by these liquidators on switching accounting basis was approximately $4.5 million, whereas the output tax returned was approximately $550,000. 6. Although companies not in liquidation or receivership can similarly change their GST accounting basis, this is not considered an equivalent problem because such persons who stay in business eventually come into a net paying position. 7. Officials also note that it is not the policy intent of the GST legislation that refunds obtained by changing GST accounting bases be used to fund the liquidation or receivership of private companies. 8. The problem, therefore, is liquidators or receivers engaging in tax driven behaviour in order to generate GST refunds, which is at the detriment of the Government's tax base. 9. This Statement considers whether the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 should be amended to preclude liquidators and receivers switching from the payments basis to the invoice basis when accounting for GST. OBJECTIVES 10. The main objective is to ensure that liquidators and receivers are not able to engage in tax driven behaviour to generate GST refunds to the detriment of the Government's tax base. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 11. The options that we have identified include retaining the status quo or amending the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to preclude liquidators and receivers switching from the payments basis to the invoice basis when accounting for GST. 2 12. The preferred option is to amend the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to preclude liquidators and receivers switching from the payments basis to the invoice basis when accounting for GST in order to generate GST refunds. The amendment should also apply to voluntary administrators. 13. Officials considered other options including making the change of accounting basis subject to Commissioner discretion and amending the incapacitated persons provisions in section 58 of the GST Act 1985. These options were disregarded because a discretion would be arbitrary in nature and the incapacitated persons provisions have a might wider ambit than liquidators and receivers. 14. The impacts of the preferred option are: Impacts Comment Net Impact Costs Benefits Comment Net Impact Liquidators/ Receivers $2.5 million less tax refunded. Marginally reduced compliance costs as no longer making a change in accounting basis. Approximately 400 companies going into liquidation each year could be affected by this proposal. Negative Government None. $2.5 million per annum. GST no longer inappropriately used to fund liquidation or receivership of private companies. Positive CONSULTATION 15. Officials have discussed the amendment with representatives from INSOL (a group representing insolvency practitioners). The group considered the GST refunds were used to investigate companies, which could result in higher returns to creditors and therefore supported the status quo. It is not the policy intent of the legislation that GST refunds obtained by changing GST accounting bases be used to fund the liquidation or receivership of private companies. 16. Inland Revenue has also consulted with the Treasury who agree with our recommendation. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 17. The recommended option is to amend the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to preclude liquidators and receivers switching from the payments basis to the invoice basis when accounting for GST. IMPLEMENTATION 18. The necessary legislative change will be included in the tax bill scheduled to be introduced in September 2011, with application to payments made on or after the date of 3 enactment. There is no need for transitional provisions. No implementation risks have been identified. Implementation can be managed within existing systems. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 19. There are no plans to monitor evaluate and review the GST treatment of liquidators and receivers following this amendment. If any specific concerns are raised, officials will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process. Also, the Goods and Service Tax Act 1985 is subject to regular review by officials. 4 Regulatory Impact Statement GST and late payment fees Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It addresses an issue with the GST treatment of late payment fees by taxpayers and a potential significant fiscal risk if GST is not payable on the fees. Late payment fees are fixed fees charged by businesses to their customers on late payment of accounts. The fees are different from penalty and default interest payments which are specifically GST-exempt in the same way as other financial transactions. Inconsistency between interpretation and practice has created a lack of clarity around the application of the GST rules to late payment fees. The current interpretation of the law raises boundary issues that would result in different GST treatments for comparable fees, such as prompt payment discounts, depending on how the fees are structured. There should not be a difference in GST treatments between two similar types of charges when GST is intended to be imposed on the consideration for any transaction. The current interpretation creates a significant fiscal risk to the GST base. It means that taxpayers, most of whom have charged GST on late fees to their customers, may be entitled to a refund of the output tax that they have returned to Inland Revenue. We recommend that a legislative amendment be made to clarify that late payment fees are subject to GST and this be made retrospective. However, we recommend a savings provision that would preserve the position that a small minority of taxpayers may have taken in relation to this matter before the effective date of the proposed legislative amendment. A general limitation of our analysis was the time constraint in developing the options. A prompt change was considered necessary as maintaining the status quo raises a potentially significant fiscal risk. We consulted with the Treasury, which agrees with our analysis. Full consultation has not been undertaken with the public so as not to signal a potential base maintenance change that could result in a behavioural change by taxpayers. We do, however, intend to inform a small number of taxpayers, who may be affected by the amendment, of the proposed legislative change closer to the date of bill introduction. The proposed amendment does not impair private property rights, reduce market competition, provide disincentives to innovate and invest or override common law principles. As noted, a retrospective amendment in this area would remove the ability of taxpayers to seek GST refunds. However, the savings provision would maintain the existing treatment for all affected taxpayers. Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 20 July 2011 I STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. This statement considers options to address a recent issue relating to GST and late payment fees. Late payment fees are fixed fees charged by businesses to their customers in respect of the late payment of accounts - for example, a telephone company may charge their customers a set fee for the cost of administration if they do not pay their monthly telephone bill on time. These fees are common across a range of sectors and charging GST on these fees is a common practice among many businesses. The fees are different from penalty or default interest payments which are specifically GST-exempt under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("the GST Act") in the same way as financial transactions. 2. Under the GST Act, GST is only charged on a taxable supply. The term "supply" being very broadly defined in keeping with the policy of GST having the broadest base that is practically possible. However, under the current interpretation of the law, no GST should be imposed late payment types of fees as there is a lack of connection between the fee charged and the underlying supply of goods and services, even though they may represent the cost of administering the late payment. This is inconsistent with both the policy of a broad-based tax and with Inland Revenue's public statement to date which has been that while penalty interest is clearly not subject to GST, late payment fees are subject to GST. 1 3. The current interpretation of the law raises boundary issues that would result in different GST treatments for comparable fees depending on how the fees are structured. There should not be a difference in GST treatments between two types of charges when GST is intended to be imposed on the consideration for any transaction. In this respect, late payment fees should be treated in the same manner as prompt payment discounts. 4. Inconsistency between interpretation and practice has created a lack of clarity around the application of the GST rules to late payment fees. If this is maintained, there will be an ongoing fiscal cost of around $3.3 million per year. This would be the result of taxpayers who currently charge GST on late fees no longer charging it. Moreover, the same group of taxpayers may be entitled to a refund of the output tax that they have already returned to Inland Revenue. This is estimated to amount to a one-off revenue loss of approximately $13.8 million. OBJECTIVES 5. The main objective is to clarify the current law around GST and late payment fees. A clarification to the law would also ensure that there is no potential ongoing fiscal risk resulting from the inconsistency between interpretation and practice. A further objective is to ensure that this need to remove the fiscal risk is balanced with the need to treat fairly those who have taken an interpretation that is justifiable under the current law. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 6. The options we have identified are to maintain the status quo or to make a legislative amendment which would clarify that late payment fees are subject to GST. For base 1 See GST Treatment of Interest Charged on Overdue Accounts — TIB Volume Two No. 5 December (1990). 2 maintenance reasons and to remove the fiscal risk resulting from the current interpretation of the rules, our preferred option is a legislative amendment. Legislative amendment 7. Our preferred option is that the application date of an amendment is aligned with the last year in which taxpayers can possibly argue for a refund of overpaid GST. Under the GST rules, the Commissioner must refund overpaid GST if he is satisfied that the amount of the refund represents an excess over the amount properly payable and the four-year time-bar in the Tax Administration Act 1994 has not expired. However, this time-bar is extended to eight years if the GST overpaid is the result of a clear mistake or simple oversight. Under this option, the effective date would be the date that is 8 years before the date of bill introduction, say from September 2003, with application for taxable periods ending on or after that date. 8. This option would also include a savings provision that would effectively preserve the positions that taxpayers may have taken in relation to this matter, say prior to the introduction of legislative amendment. 9. We recognise that a savings provision may give rise to concerns about the potential disparity between taxpayers who have applied the current law and have not charged GST on late fees, and those who, based on their understanding of the rules have charged GST. However, on balance, we believe that this concern is outweighed by both the need to treat fairly those who have taken an interpretation that is justifiable under the current law, and the need to remove the fiscal risks outlined. Other legislative options considered 10. Another option considered was a prospective legislative amendment - that is, an application date that would make GST chargeable on all late payment fees from the date of bill introduction. This option would prevent taxpayers from either adopting or continuing to rely on the recent interpretation of the current law from this date. Practically speaking, it means that taxpayers who had previously relied on the interpretation would not have to account for the GST that they did not charge during the periods before the introduction of the legislative change. Equally however, it would mean that taxpayers who had charged GST on late fees before the introduction of the amendment may be entitled to a refund of the output tax that they have returned to Inland Revenue. As noted above, the fiscal cost of this would be about $13.8 million. 11. We also considered a retrospective amendment without a savings provision. This option would make it clear that GST has always been chargeable on these types of fees. In practice, it would prevent taxpayers who have already charged GST on their late payment fees from claiming refunds. A retrospective application date, however, would mean that taxpayers, who had relied on an interpretation that is justifiable under current law and not charged GST on their late payment fees, would now be accountable for the outstanding output tax from the effective date of the retrospective amendment. 12. The preferred option, therefore, represents a compromise between these alternative options. The inclusion of a savings provision allays concerns about enacting retrospective 3 legislation while, at the same time, ensuring that the interpretation of the current law and any proposed amendments to the rules around GST and late payment fees do not pose an ongoing risk to the GST base. Status quo 13. Maintaining the status quo is unsustainable. It results in uncertainty, creates boundary issues, and poses a significant fiscal risk to the GST base. 14. No social, environmental or cultural costs are expected to arise under any of these options. CONSULTATION 15. We consulted with the Treasury, which agrees with our analysis. Full consultation has not been undertaken with the public so as not to signal a potential base maintenance change that could result in a behavioural change by taxpayers. We do, however, intend to inform a small number of taxpayers, who may be affected by the amendment, of the proposed legislative change closer to the date of bill introduction. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 16. The recommended option is a legislative amendment to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 that would clarify that late payment fees imposed by business on their customers are subject to GST. IMPLEMENTATION 17. The necessary legislative change would be included in the tax bill scheduled to be introduced in September 2011, with an application date that is 8 years before the date of bill introduction, and application for taxable periods ending on or after that date. A savings provision would also apply to preserve the positions that taxpayers took before the date of bill introduction. 18. No implementation risks have been identified. The proposed changes can be done within existing administrative functions. Any legislative change in this area will be communicated. Specifically, Inland Revenue will prepare a Tax Information Bulletin item to communicate the effect of the proposed changes to taxpayers. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 19. In general, the monitoring, evaluation and review of these proposals would take place under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, this would mean that these proposals would be reviewed at a time after it has had some time to work. Any changes that are needed to give the legislation its intended effect would be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 4
Regulatory Impact Statement Canterbury Earthquake: Extensions of time for meeting tax obligations Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to allow time limits in tax legislation to be extended, when people have been unable to meet the limits because of the Canterbury earthquake. Three main options have been analysed. These are: • giving Inland Revenue a broad power to extend any time limit in a case that warrants it; • providing for a blanket extension of time limits for all taxpayers likely to have been affected; and • giving Inland Revenue the power to provide specific extensions of specific time limits. Our preferred option is the first option, because it provides the best targeted solution at a low cost. It does involve some compliance and administrative costs, which may be able to be mitigated by efficient implementation. An important constraint on the analysis was the short time allowed for it. It has not been possible in the time available to gather comprehensive and reliable information about the nature and extent of the problem, or to accurately quantify the costs and benefits of alternative options. Partial consultation was undertaken. The Treasury has agreed with our preferred approach. The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants has also agreed with the broad approach, but was given very little time to consider it. We have also begun consultation with the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Commission, but have not completed this yet. We note that the preferred option would have retrospective application. This would typically be to the benefit of taxpayers, since retrospectivity will excuse late actions that should already have been performed. In rare cases, however, it could be to the detriment of a taxpayer (and there is no explicit right of appeal). The safeguard in those cases is that time limits may only be changed ifthis is fair and equitable in the circumstances. We also note that costs may be imposed on businesses under the preferred option because of actions they may need to take to qualify or apply for time extensions, and because there may be cases where the preferred option has retrospective application. However, these costs are expected to be minimal and Inland Revenue will design the approach to minimise any costs as far as possible. Except as may be noted in this statement, none of the policy options is likely to impose additional costs on businesses, impair private property rights, restrict market competition, or reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. raig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 25 March 2011 2 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. Following the Canterbury Earthquake, many New Zealanders have been unable to meet time limits for meeting tax obligations. They may have been unable to meet time limits because they were preoccupied with more immediate concerns, such as obtaining necessities, or the safety of family members. Actions might also have been delayed when it was physically impossible to perform them, such as when necessary tax records were held within the 'red zone', or because postal or telephone services were disrupted. In these cases taxpayers outside the Christchurch area may also have been affected. 2. There are many statutory time limits in the Inland Revenue Acts (there are 16 current Inland Revenue Acts including the Income Tax Act, the GST Act, the Tax Administrations Act, the Student Loan Scheme Act, the Child Support Act and the Kiwisaver Act). 3. It would be unreasonable to penalise taxpayers for exceeding a time limit when they have been prevented by the earthquake from meeting it. 4. There may also be some cases, though expected to be rare, where it would be unreasonable to penalise Inland Revenue for failing to meet statutory time frames that apply to it. 5. Inland Revenue is able to extend time limits in some cases and has been doing so to the maximum extent possible when taxpayers have requested this. However, there are numerous cases where it does not appear to be possible to extend time limits under existing law, and other cases where authority for extending time limits may be unclear. For example, Inland Revenue cannot extend the period for filing of 2009-1 0 income tax returns past 31 March 2011. 6. Section 226 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 gives the Governor General the power to extend any time for doing something under the Income Tax Act or the GST Act, by Order in Council. This power is not suitable in the current circumstances because it does not apply to all Inland Revenue Acts, it requires that a specific time be set for each time limit, and the power may not be delegated to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, which would make administration impractical (many time limits are likely to be involved). 7. Iftime limits are not able to be extended, it is expected that many taxpayers will fail to file returns by their due date. These taxpayers will not be charged penalties or interest because of the lateness as these have already been remitted. Lateness may, however, have other consequences, such as losing credit for "good behaviour" in some provisions. This is likely to be seen as heavy-handed and could affect voluntary compliance. 8. Not providing extensions will also mean that taxpayers miss out on benefits that they otherwise would have been entitled to. Again, this could be seen as unfair. For example, parents are required to provide Inland Revenue with a child's IRD number within 8 weeks of Working for Families payments starting. If this is not done, IRD is required to stop making the payments until the number is received. 9. In the time available we have not been able to quantify the scale of the problem, but it is likely to be significant. For example, there are many different returns that must be filed on or around 31 March. Due to the inability for many businesses in the CBD to access their records, we expect many businesses will not to be in a position to file these returns on time. 3 OBJECTIVES 10. The government wishes to be able to extend time frames for meeting tax obligations in cases where people have been prevented from meeting those time frames by the Christchurch Earthquake and its aftershocks. 11. In general the government does not wish to extend time limits in cases where obligations might reasonably have been met. Instead, it would like to confine extensions to cases in which an extension would be fair, and in which the obligation is eventually met in a time that is not unreasonable. 12. The best outcome would be one in which time frames are extended in these circumstances. 13. The outcome needs to be achieved more or less immediately, because time limits are already being exceeded. 14. Given these objectives, assessment criteria for any outcome will include: • Allowing limits to be extended when there is demonstrable need; and • Not allowing limits to be extended when there is not demonstrable need. 15. Added to these criteria, it will also be important to consider: • Administrative and compliance costs; and • Fiscal costs. 16. As consideration of the options below demonstrates, there may be trade-offs between these objectives. For example, keeping extensions well-targeted to cases of demonstrable need may increase administrative or compliance costs because taxpayers need to demonstrate a need. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS Main options 17. Three main options have been identified for dealing with the problem. 18. We have not identified any non-regulatory options. The core problem is the lack of existing legal authority to extend fixed time limits. This cannot be remedied without legislative change. First option 19. The first and preferred regulatory option is to provide Inland Revenue with a power to extend the time for doing anything under an Inland Revenue Act when: • It has not been possible to meet the time limit because of the Canterbury earthquake or its aftershocks; and 4 • It would be fair and equitable to extend the time. 20. As a consequence of the "fair and equitable" requirement, it is expected that extensions would be given only for a reasonable period (for example, until the earliest time at which the person might reasonably be able to perform the action). 21. The power would apply retrospectively from 4 September 2010, to deal with cases in which time limits have already been exceeded. The power would expire on 1 April 2012 (though it may cease to be used before this time). 22. This option would deal with the problem. It would allow for time limits to be extended, but only in cases where obligations would not reasonably be able to be complied with. 23. The main benefit would be to relieve earthquake victims or those they deal with from the burden of unreasonably having to meet time limits to comply with the law or claim a benefit they should be entitled to. This is an unquantifiable benefit. 24. In principle this option neither materially reduces the amount of tax collected, nor delays collection (the extension of a time limit simply recognises that there would not have been compliance with the time limit anyway). However, if the power continued to be used after September 2011, there might be reduced government revenue from use-of-money interest (before that time, use-of-money interest will already be able to be waived under an existing regulation). 25. This option does have administrative and compliance costs. Taxpayers would need to contact Inland Revenue to claim or apply for extensions oftime, and Inland Revenue would need to process these applications or extensions. Inland Revenue would endeavour to reduce these costs through efficient administration (see Implementation below). 26. This option provides a lot of discretion to Inland Revenue, including the discretion to extend time limits applying to Inland Revenue itself. It would be important to ensure this power is exercised wisely. Inland Revenue advises that if the power is exercised in respect of time limits imposed on Inland Revenue itself, the discretion would not be delegated to anybody below the level of an Assurance Manager (who reports to a Group Manager). Some further discussion of this issue is included in the Implementation section below. Second option 27. The second regulatory option is a blanket extension oftime for all taxpayers likely to have been affected. Under this option, for example, all time limits could be extended by two months for anybody living in Christchurch. There would be no test offaimess of equity, and no requirement that a person be affected by the Earthquake to qualify. 28. This option would solve the problem for some affected taxpayers, but also for some unaffected taxpayers who might reasonably have met existing time limits. This makes it more likely that the options would result in a significant delay in tax collected. This option would also not deal with the problem for taxpayers outside Canterbury who may nevertheless have been affected. 29. This option would have administrative costs because Inland Revenue would need to identify taxpayers who qualify for the extension, which could be difficult depending on the 5 criteria used, and make appropriate changes to systems and procedures to ensure the extension applied automatically to these people. The option would have low or nil compliance costs for taxpayers making use of the extension. Third option 30. The third regulatory option is legislation to override specific time limits. This differs from the first and second options, which apply generally to any time limit. This option is infeasible given the short time available for developing a solution. Even if it were not, it carries the high risk that a particular time frame would be overlooked. 31. The following table summarises the options we have considered. Meets Objectives Fiscal cost Admin/Compliance costs Option 1 Possible but limited Yes - requirement to (if time limits are make/process (Commissioner Yes extended past applications for discretion) September 2011) extensions Yes - objective to extend time limits for those affected Option 2 (Non- Likely (unquantified Depends on the criteria discretionary but potentially high) for extension. Possibly extension) No - objective to lower than Option 1. not extend time limits beyond what is necessary No - likely to miss Possible but limited Yes - requirement to Option 3 (Individual relevant time limits (if time limits are make/process time limits extended) due to time expected past applications for constraints September) extensions Other design choices 32. Within any of the options, two further sub-options were considered. 33. The first sub-option is whether the ability to power time limits should be exercised where the time limit is a limit on Inland Revenue itself. The preferred sUb-option is to allow the power to be exercised in such circumstances (it is anticipated that such use would be rare). 34. An example of a situation where Inland Revenue might need to exercise the power in this way is as follows: a taxpayer commences a disputes procedure by sending a document to Christchurch, where the document sits unopened in the 'red zone' (where Inland Revenue's Christchurch office is) until after the allowable response period. When the response period ends before a response from Inland Revenue, the document is normally taken to have been 6 accepted as correct. However, Inland Revenue should have the ability to consider the document properly before acceptance. 35. Some taxpayers may be disadvantaged where Inland Revenue extends a time limit applying to itself. The example above is a case in point, since a taxpayer may have taken a position in the dispute which would have been accepted but for a change in the response period. After exercise of the power to change in the response period, Inland Revenue might challenge the unrealistic position. 36. Not having the ability to apply the power to itself would increase the risk of lost tax revenue. 37. It may be possible to take administrative actions to ensure that the power is not misused (see Implementation below). It is also noted that if the preferred option is adopted, there will be a legislated requirement that an extension be fair and equitable in the circumstances. 38. The second sub-option was whether or not to allow for a formal appeals or disputes process when a person disagrees with the exercise of the power. 39. The preferred sub-option is not to allow for such a process. In part, this is because there would be insufficient time to design a robust process. Other considerations are the likely cost of such a process and the fact that the preferred option would nearly always leave a taxpayer in a better position than before (or in the same position, if it was decided the power should not be exercised). There is a small risk with the preferred sub-option that taxpayers would not have a remedy in cases where they are made worse off (say when the power is applied to Inland Revenue itself). We consider this is reduced in the preferred option by the requirement that the extension may only be given if it is fair and equitable to do so. Finally, we note that under the Tax Administration Act, section 13 8E(1) does not allow challenges that relate to decisions of the Commissioner to extend time limits. In this regard, the preferred option is consistent with current law. CONSULTATION 40. There was not time for a full consultation about this policy, which is a response to an emergency that could not have been anticipated. 41. However, we have consulted with the Treasury, which agrees with our preferred option. 42. We have also undertaken informal consultation with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, which made representations about problems with time limits. They have agreed with the general approach we are taking, but we note that they were given extremely limited time to consider the issues. 43. We have also consulted with the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Commission, which is a requirement of the Canterbury Earthquake Response and Recovery Act 2011 (the legislation under which the preferred option would be achieved). This process has not yet concluded. 44. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has been informed. 7 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 45. The table above summarises the costs and benefits of each of the three options. 46. The first option (a broad power to extend any time limit where warranted) is our preferred option because it effectively solves the problem at low cost and would deal with a very wide range of situations taxpayer might find themselves in. The first option does involve some compliance costs for taxpayers - ringing or writing to claim or apply for extensions of time -but this is a small cost and administrative efforts will be made to reduce this cost. The other options either do not solve the problem quickly or carry a significant risk that people who are unaffected by the earthquake will benefit (at a cost to other taxpayers). IMPLEMENTATION 47. Only initial consideration has been given to implementation of the preferred option. 48. It is expected that in some cases Inland Revenue would announce a generic extension of time applying to all taxpayers in a particular class of taxpayers. In others Inland Revenue would grant specific extensions to a single taxpayer. 49. At this stage, it is expected in almost all cases that taxpayers would need to contact Inland Revenue to claim or apply for the extension, rather than "self assessing" eligibility and simply performing a late action. Inland Revenue will have no other way of knowing that the person is eligible for the extension. 50. This will increase the number of contacts with call centres and other staff members within Inland Revenue. Measures to manage this have been discussed. For example, Inland Revenue might provide special 0800 numbers for people to call and apply for a particular extension. If such numbers were implemented, people would be able to leave a message with the necessary information and be contacted at a later time by Inland Revenue. This would reduce the risk of call overloading or long waits for assistance. However, it may also be possible to deal with contacts through normal channels. 51. There would also be an increase in work because of final processing of applications or claims. This would be managed within Inland Revenue's existing workloads and funding. There is a risk that this would lead to delays in other areas, but this problem is expected to be short-lived if it occurs. 52. Electronic systems are not expected to be affected in any significant way. Inland Revenue is in a good starting position because extension of time limits is relatively normal (albeit not all the time limits that the Order would effect). Inland Revenue's electronic systems therefore typically allow for the extension of dates. Many of the dates that are not commonly able to be extended would not have effects that require system changes; instead they would affect later processes such as audits, which rely on people rather than systems and are therefore more adaptable. 53. The proposed solution would grant a power to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The Commissioner would then delegate that power (as he delegates many of his other powers under Section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) to other authorised employees and officers within Inland Revenue. Existing processes are in place for managing delegations to properly qualified staff members, and these mitigate the risk that a power would be mis- applied. 8 MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 54. Inland Revenue has generic processes in place for monitoring the performance of areas that will be processing claims or applications for time extensions, and these would be likely to indicate any significant problems that arise with processing. 55. External organisations such as the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants might also be expected to bring other problems, such as any unwillingness to apply the power when it is warranted, to our attention or to the attention of Ministers. 56. If the preferred option is implemented, it is planned that a general review will be carried out after approximately six months to determine if the power is still required. If no more extensions of time were being approved at this time, it might be desirable to revoke the power. 9
Regulatory Impact Statement Tax relief for donated goods - Christchurch earthquake Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to provide tax relief for goods donated (or supplied for less than market value) to support the christchurch earthquake relief. The analysis has been undertaken in a very constrained timeframe, due to the urgency of the Government decisions that are required. This has severely limited the depth of research and analysis able to be undertaken. Where fiscal cost estimates have been made there is a significant degree of uncertainty involved due to difficulties in accurately estimating the value of donations (or supplies for less than market value) that may be made. As a result of the urgency of the Govemment decisions that need to be made in relation in this problem, consultation has been extremely limited but the relief applies for a limited period only. Consideration has been given to correspondence received by Ministers and officials in connection with the issue. Consultation has been undertaken with the Treasury and the Treasury supports Inland Revenue's conclusions and recommendations. None of the policy options would impose additional costs on businesses, impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives for businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. Dr Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 17 March20lI STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Background 1. Following the Christchurch earthquake on 22 February 2011, many individuals and businesses have donated (or supplied for less than market value) goods, as opposed to making cash donations, to those affected by the Christchurch earthquake. Several public calls have been made to Ministers and officials seeking legislation to provide tax relief for donated goods, especially trading stock donated by businesses. Current law 2. Section LD I of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("ITA") allows an individual who makes a charitable or other public benefit gift to claim a tax credit of one-third of total gifts made to donee organisations in a taxyear, up to the level of their taxable income. Section DB 41 of the ITA allows a company a deduction for a charitable or other public benefit gift that it makes to a donee organisation. Such deductions are limited to the level of the company's net income in the corresponding tax year (before deducting the donation amount). 3. Section GC I of the ITA treats a person who disposes of trading stock for no consideration or for an amount less than market value as having derived an amount equal to the market value of the trading stock at the time of disposal. 4. Under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 ("EGDA"), gift duty is payable on gifts made by a person exceeding an aggregate value of $27,000 in a l2-month period. For gift duty purposes, a gift is something given, other than by will, where the person making the transfer (the donor) does not receive fully adequate consideration in money or money's worth. The policy problem 5. Currently, those donating goods in response to the Christchurch earthquake are not eligible for the donations tax credit or the company donation deduction. 6. The effect of section GC 1 of the ITA is that people donating (or supplying for less than market value) trading stock in response to the Christchurch earthquake will have to return as income for tax purposes the full market value of that trading stock. 7. The provision of trading stock for less than market value would also constitute a gift under the EGDA. 8. Officials ate aware that donations of trading stock to people affected by the Christchurch earthquake have already occurred and are probably widespread. It can be reasonably assumed that many people making these donations of trading stock lack awareness of the current law. 9. The immediate provision of goods to those in need is of vital importance to the Christchurch earthquake relief effort. The existing tax laws do not encourage the donation (or supply for less than market value) of goods to assist the Christchurch earthquake relief. 10. The existing tax laws are designed to deal with manipulation by businesses. As a result, they do not deal adequately with donations of trading stock, particularly in circumstances such as the Christchurch earthquake. This is an unintended policy outcome due simply to the donation of trading stock by businesses to disaster victims not having been contemplated. OBJECTIVES I 1. The desired Government outcomes are ro: o ensure that the tax treatment of goods donated (or supplied for less than market value) as part of the Christchurch earthquake relief is appropriate; . ensure that the revenue base remains sufficiently protected; and o provide certainty to those making or contemplating making donations (or supplies for less than market value) of goods as part of the Christchurch earthquake relief. 12. The desired Government outcomes must be achieved within a short timeframe. This is because they are responding to a devastating event that has already occurred. Ideally, people should have certainty as to what the tax treatment will be in respect of certain things they have done or are contemplating doing as soon as practically possible. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 13. Several different options have been considered to address the problem and achieve the desired Government outcomes. Options I and2 are alternatives to one another. Option 3 is a separate option, which could be used either by itself, or in conjunction with option 2, but not in conjunction with option 1. Option 1: Make all non-monetary donations eligible for tax relief 14. Currently, non-monetary donations are not eligible for the donations tax credit (for individuals) or the company donation deduction. An option that has been considered is making all non-monetary donations eligible for the donations tax credit (for individuals) and the company donation deduction. 15. This option would be a significant change to the current policy settings for charitable giving. Furthermore, this is a policy change that has previously been considered and rejected by the Government. 16. Such a policy change would be complex and fiscally expensive and there would be real risk to the revenue base. A key problem area is the valuation of non-cash items, especially where there is no easily ascertainable market for those items, such as second-hand goods. 17. If this option were chosen, there would be no gift duty problem as the charitable giving tax incentives are only available for gifts to donee organisations and such gifts are already exempt from gift duty. Option 2: Make donated tradÍng stock etigible for tax relief 18. Currently, businesses donating (or supplying for less than market value) trading stock in response to the Christchurch earthquake will have to return as income for tax purposes the full market value of that trading stock. The public calls regarding the tax treatment of donations have been principally focused on trading stock. An option that has been considered is a targeted earthquake related donated trading stock provision. For completeness, this option would cover the 4 September 2010 Canterbury earthquake as well as the 22 February 20ll Christchurch earthquake. 19. Under this option, the disposal of trading stock by businesses would be valued at the actual consideration, if any, received (normally nil). This would apply for trading stock disposed of with the intention of helping to alleviate the impact of the earthquakes. The rule would provide that the trading stock must be: r of a type the donor or supplier normally deals in; o donated or supplied for less than market value; o donated or supplied to non-associated persons; and o donated or supplied within four months from the applicable earthquake. 20. Implementing a specifically targeted donated trading stock provision would reduce the risk to the revenue base. Also, there is a precedent already existing in current law in respect of transfers of livestock because of self-assessed adverse events. 2I. It is difficult to accurately estimate the expected fiscal costs of such a measure due to difficulties in estimating the value of donations (and supplies for less than market value) that may be made. Officials' best estimate is that the fiscal cost of this option and option 3 would be $3 million in the 2010111 fiscal year. 22. It is not expected that there would be significant compliance or administration costs as a result of this option. 23. If this option were chosen by itself, there would still be a gift duty problem because the provision of trading stock for less than market value would constitute a gift under the EGDA. Option 3: Make donated trading stock exempt from gift duty 24. Currently, under the EGDA, the donation (or supply without receiving fully adequate consideration in money or money's worth) of goods made as part of the Christchurch earthquake relief will be subject to gift duty if the donor makes gifts exceeding an aggregate value of $27,000 in a l2-month period, and those gifts do not fall within one of the current exemptions. 25. An option that has been considered is to exempt from gift duty any gifts of trading stock in the same circumstances covered in option 2 above. 26. This option would result in a reduction in gift duty collected by the Crown but would help to encourage the donation of trading stock for those who seek to support the Christchurch earthquake relief, by removing tax costs which disincentivise gifting. CONSULTATION 27. The urgency of the Govemment decisions that need to be made in relation to this problem has meant that consultation has been extremely limited. Consideration has been given to correspondence received by Ministers and officials in connection with the issue. Consultation has been undertaken with the Treasury and the Treasury supports the prefened option. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 28. Officials have considered the options outlined above. Officials consider that implementing option 2 in conjunction with option 3 would best address the problem in a way that meets the desired Government outcomes. This solution limits the potential cost and risks associated with providing tax relief for donated goods, and removes the disincentives faced by businesses in regard to the donation (or supply for less than market value) of trading stock in aid ofthe Christchurch earthquake relief. It provides appropriate tax relieffor businesses that are supporting the earthquake relief effort, whilst providing the necessary degree of protection to the revenue base and avoiding the major problems that would be created by widening the charitable giving tax incentive provisions to include non-monetary donations. IMPLEMENTATION 29. The proposed options would be given effect by amendments to the ITA and the EGDA. The amendments would apply retrospectively. The legislative vehicle for these amendments is a special omnibus earthquake related tax bill expected to be introduced and enacted in May 2OII. 30. Officials do not foresee any systems issues arising in connection with the implementation of the proposed options. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 31. In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTPP"). The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would generally be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP.
Regulatory Impact Statement Tax relief for welfare payments by employers - christchurch earthquake Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to provide tax relief for welfare payments by employers to employees to help them recover from the 4 September 2010 Canterbury earthquake and its aftershock, the 22 February Christchurch earthquake. The analysis has been undertaken in a very constrained timeframe, due to the urgency of the Government decisions that are required. This has severely limited the depth of research and analysis able to be undertaken. Where fiscal cost estimates have been made there is a significant degree of uncertainty involved due to difficulties in accurately estimating the quantum of employer welfare support and the proportion of that support that would in any case be treated correctly for tax purposes. Also, communicating the issue to employers at this stage is not consistent with the approach that Inland Revenue has taken to the earthquake, given record keeping and other difficulties that taxable treatment might pose. As a result of the urgency of the Govemment decisions that need to be made in relation in this problern, consultation has been extremely limited. Consideration has been given to correspondence received by Ministers and officials in connection with the issue. Consultation has been undertaken with the Treasury and the Treasury supports Inland Revenue's conclusions and recommendations. None of the policy options would impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives for businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental cornmon law principles. One of the options selected has the potential to increase compliance costs, but only if employers wish to access tax refunds. This trade-off was necessary for equity purposes. Dr Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 17 M.arch2Dll STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Background 1. Following the Christchurch earthquake on 22February 2011, many employers provided welfare contributions to their employees who were affected by the earthquake. These welfare contributions have been made in a variety of different ways including pro rata cash paSrments, the specific provision of goods and services, and the provision of accommodation. Several public calls have been made to Ministers and officials seeking legislation to provide tax relief for employers for these welfare contributions. 2. This analysis is complicated because the welfare contributions, albeit to an apparently significantly lesser extent, were also made as a result of the Canterbury earthquake. Current law 3. Except to the extent the "on-premises" fringe benefit tax (FBT) exemption or the unclassified benefits de minimis threshold applies to employer provided goods and services, it is Inland Revenue's considered view that these welfare contributions are subject to either income tax or FBT as appropriate. The policy problem 4. It is arguable that, except perhaps for donations ofsundry goods, according to good tax policy these welfare contributions would be taxed notwithstanding their welfare intent. This is because the payments are made in the context of an employer/employee relationship. 5. However, it is also arguable that the govemment should encourage employer welfare contributions such as these, even though these employees are perhaps comparatively better off than other employees whose employers cannot support them in a similar fashion. 6. We are aware that ønployers have adopted different income tax positions in respect of these contributions, even though we believe that the correct approach is clear. This is particularly the case for pro rata cash payments made to, say, all Christchurch staff to alleviate their immediate welfare problems. 7. In the case of fringe benefits, these returns are not due until May and we suspect that, in general, employers will not have turned their minds to the issues here and are unlikely to return to the issues at alater time. It will simply be presumed by employers that the benefits are outside the tax net. Also, communicating the issue to employers at this stage is not consistent with the approach that Inland Revenue has taken to the earthquake, given record keeping and other difficulties that taxable treahnent might pose. In addition it is unlikely that Inland Revenue would audit in this space. OBJECTIVES 8. The desired Government outcomes are to: . uphold the general direction of tax law; o encourage (or least not discourage) employers to look after their staff; . ensure that the revenue base remains sufficiently protected; and o provide certainty to those employers providing this support to their employees who have been affected by the earthquake. 9. The desired Government outcomes must be achieved within a short timeframe. This is because they are responding to a devastating event that has already occurred. Ideally, people should have certainty as to what the tax treatment will be in respect of certain things they have done or are contemplating doing ¿ß soon as practically possible. This is certainly the case where the consequence is an exposure to income tax as larger employers have to finalise their 31 March 2011 payroll by 5 April, and smaller employers have until 20 April. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 10. Several different options (not all mutually exclusive) have been considered to address the problem and achieve the desired Government outcomes. option l.: No relief, or relief from FBT for sundry non-cash benefits only 11. The case for no relief was not seriously considered as it was obvious that, at the least, relief needs to be provided for sundry benefits where it was likely that the employer did not know which employees had got what benefits. There was also the risk of the "on-premises" FBT or the unclassified benefits de minimis threshold exemptions applyrng or not applying depending on the employer's exact circumstances. While the first issue could be addressed within the confines of existing scheme (and could potentially be FBT charged), the second issue could lead to disparate FBT expenses between onployers who had provided similar benefits, but in a different way. 12. The case for offering limited relief for sundry non-cash benefits is a mixture of pragmatism and the acknowledgement of the potential horizontal equity position between employers. 13. This option has been agreed to by Ministers. Option 2: Provide complete relief from tax for all employer welfare contributions 14. An option is to totally tax exempt all employer welfare contributions made to employees. This could be open-ended both as to when the welfare was provided, and how much was provided. That is, this option would not be limited to welfare provided following the Christchurch earthquake. Given the policy position that, except perhaps for donations of sundry goods, it is good tax policy to tax welfare contributions made in the context of an employer/employee relationship and the potential fiscal risk, this option was not considered to be appropriate. Option 3: Provide a wider limited relief 15. Ministers asked us to consider whether widely targeted and fiscally responsible relief could be offered. Ministers decided that such relief could be loosely based on the MSD grant to individuals called "earthquake job loss c.over". This grant is $400 a week per person and is payable for 6 weeks after the earthquake. Accordingly, we developed a proposal that could apply to cash payments to employees and to goods provided to specific employees. 16. The major features of this proposed relief are that the cash and/or benefits are: . capped at $2,400 per each employee with amounts over this being taxable; o paid or provided in the six weeks after the Christchurch earthquake; . not in lieu of salary or increments thereto (to help ensure appropriate targeting); o not targeted on seniority of employee (again to help ensure appropriate targeting); and o not available to persons associated with the olvners of the employer, except where the benefit is of the type that has been provided to all non-associated employees (again to help ensure appropriate targeting). 17. From a compliance cost perspective, this is easy to comply with where the welfare contribution is of items that would otherwise be subject to FBT (because this is not calculated until later in May), and of cash contributions which have not been subject to income tax (in the form of PAYE). However, where income tax been accounted for, there are significantly higher compliance and administration costs, which can be partially mitigated by making the announcement as soon as is possible. Steps are under way to meet this objective if this option is adopted. 18. The compliance and administration cost risk has been considered and while there are difficulties for both Inland Revenue and employers if the adjustments cannot be completed before the 2010-11 tax year payroll can be finalised, we will seek to put in place further mechanisms to mitigate the risk in the circumstances. 19. This option has been agreed to by Ministers. option 4: Provide a tax exemption for employer provided accommodation 20. A number of employers are providing or meeting the cost of employee accoÍrmodation (generally short term) when the employees' houses are unusable or where the employee needs a respite from Christchurch. If employers did not provide this assistance, frequently the state would at least have to contribute to this cost. 21. This option would potentially be subject to abuse and so the same general rules that would apply for option 3 would also apply for this option, except that there would be no cap. Further, if this is adopted, it would likely be announced on 29 March, and in relation to the Christchurch earthquake, the six week period expires on the 5ü of April, which also helps mitigate the fiscal risk. 22. Again, this option has been agreed to by Ministers. CONSULTATION 25. The urgency of the Government decisions that need to be made in relation to this problem has meant that consultation has been externely limited. Consideration has been given to correspondence received by Ministers and officials in connection with the issue. Consultation has been undertaken with the Treasury and the Treasury accepts the preferred options. 23. However, there will be a period for public feedback after the announcement on 29 Match, and we propose to consult on the draft legislation with two taxpayer representative organisations before the legislation is finalised. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 24. Officials have considered the options outlined above. Officials consider that implementing options l, 3 and 4 are appropriate and best address the problem in a way that meets the desired Government outcomes. This solution limits the potential cost and risks associated with providing tax relief. It provides a more publicly acceptable tax treatment for employers that are supporting the relief effort than the status quo, whilst providing the necessary degree ofprotection to the revenue base. 25. Further, it has been agreed by Ministers that, for equity reasons, these options would also apply to the 4 September 2010 Canterbury earthquake. IMPLEMENTATION 26. The proposed options will be given effect by amendments to the Income Tax Act. The amendments will apply retrospectively. The legislative vehicle for these amendments is a special omnibus earthquake related tax bill expected to be introduced and enacted in May 2011. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIE\\ry 27. In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTPP"). The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP is the implonentation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, arry changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would generally be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP.
Regulatory Impact Statement Child support scheme reform AGENCY DISCLOSURE STATEMENT This regulatory impact statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The statement is detailed since it deals with a large number of options for the potential reform of the New Zealand child support scheme, which will have implications for a significant number of children and parents. The statement provides an analysis of the existing child support rules and considers whether alternative measures could better provide for the interests of children involved in the scheme. We believe that the current child support scheme does not always adequately take the individual circumstances of parents into account, and this can make some parents less willing to meet their payment obligations. There has been consultation with a range of Government agencies on child support issues over a period of time. This consultation was with the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Women's Affairs, the Treasury and the Families Commission. There has also been significant public consultation on options for child support reform. The changes recommended to the child support formula would have financial implications for some parents. However, it is estimated that over 82 percent of current child support received and about 74 percent of child support paid would therefore either be unaffected or affected to the extent of plus or minus $66 per month (plus or minus $800 per year). Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats and uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. None of the policy options would restrict market competition, reduce the incentives for businesses to innovate and invest, unduly impair private property rights or override fundamental common law principles. One of the policy options would, however, impose minor additional costs on some businesses that employ parents who pay child support, although these additional costs will not be significant and already form part of the existing PAYE processes. ? C Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 26 July 2011 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM Background 1. The New Zealand child support scheme helps to provide financial support for over 210,000 children. The scheme was established by the Child Support Act 1991, which revised the rules relating to child maintenance when agreement between parents proves difficult or when the receiving parent is a beneficiary. 2. One of the Government's key social policy objectives is to ensure that New Zealanders have an equal opportunity to participate in and contribute to society. This includes providing a safety net through the benefit system for those who are unable, for various reasons, to financially support themselves. In the context of child support, this means that child support payments are collected and delivered for the benefit of the children that they are intended for, and they ensure that parents do not pass their financial responsibilities to maintain their children onto other members of society. This is why parents can be liable for child support even when the receiving parent receives a state-provided benefit. 3. The child support scheme is needed when parents cannot mutually agree on their relative financial contributions to support their children (or when the receiving parent receives a state-provided benefit). Although many parents reach private agreement on their financial contributions and care arrangements, and outcomes may be more satisfactory if they do, many cannot achieve agreement. A back-stop is needed in these circumstances, and this is provided by the child support scheme. 4. The scheme is not, however, intended to provide full financial compensation to offset any decline in family members' living standards as a result of parents living apart. A decline in living standards is often inevitable in these circumstances. There is often a duplication of housing and related costs, such as utilities and household furnishings. There are also additional costs associated with children visiting or staying with the paying parent, such as play and study space, toys and play equipment, and transport costs. 5. Given its importance and impact on New Zealand society, it is essential that the child support scheme operates as effectively as possible, and in the best interests of the children involved. How child support works 6. The child support scheme is administered by Inland Revenue, which is responsible for both assessing contributions and collecting payments. The child support scheme is voluntary for parents unless the caregiver is receiving a sole-parent benefit. 7. When an application for child support has been properly made, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is bound to accept it. Liability then arises under a simple administrative formula. The parent with the liability makes his or her payment to the Crown which then passes it to the person who has primary care for the child. In most cases this will be the child's other parent. If the caregiver is receiving a sole-parent benefit, the child support payments are retained by the Crown to help defray the cost of the benefit and any excess is passed on to the caregiver. 2 The standard formula 8. The current formula for calculating child support is: (a - b) x c where: "a" is the child support income amount; "b" is the living allowance; and "c" is the child support percentage. 9. For most paying parents, the child support income amount is their taxable income in the preceding income year. The maximum child support income that can be assessed is set at two and a half times the national average earnings for men and women as at mid-February of the tax year immediately preceding the most recent tax year. The maximum is currently $121,833. 10. There are six separate living allowance levels, ranging from $14,281 to $36,417, depending on whether the paying parent is living alone or with a partner and/or other children. The allowance is based on benefit rates plus a set amount for each dependent child up to a maximum of four children. 11. Once the living allowance has been deducted from child support income, the product is multiplied by the child support percentage relevant for the number of children being supported. The standard percentages are: No. of children Child support percentage - sole care 1 18 2 24 3 27 4 or more 30 12. There is a minimum amount of child support payable each year. The current minimum amount is $848. Shared care 13. The child support percentages are reduced if parents share the care of their child. Under the Child Support Act, care of a child is regarded as being shared when each provider of care shares the ongoing daily care of the child "substantially equally" with the other care provider. A paying parent who looks after a child for at least 40 percent of nights in a year is considered to meet this test. 3 14. If a parent does not meet this test, he or she may qualify under an alternative test based on the courts' interpretation of "substantially equally". This requires at least 50 percent of the responsibility in relation to the factors constituting care other than overnight care. 15. If shared care is established, parents can cross-apply for child support. This involves respective liabilities being offset to produce a net amount for one parent to pay. Administrative reviews 16. If either parent considers that the amount payable under the formula is not appropriate, they can apply for an administrative review under one or more of 10 grounds set out in the Child Support Act. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue then appoints an independent review officer experienced in relevant cases to consider the application. The review officer makes a recommendation on whether departure from the child support formula assessment is warranted. The Commissioner has the discretion to either accept the review officer's recommendation or conduct a rehearing. Reasons for the review 17. Although the current child support scheme provides a relatively straightforward way of calculating child support liability for the majority of parents, there are some major concerns that seem to be affecting an increasing number of parents (and therefore children). 18. The primary assumption under the current scheme is that the paying parent is the sole income earner and that the receiving parent is the main care provider. However, when parents live apart, there is a greatly increased emphasis on shared parental responsibility and both parents remaining actively involved in their children's lives. Participation rates of both parents, particularly in part-time work, has also increased since the scheme was introduced, resulting in the principal carer of the children now being more likely to be in paid work. 19. Escalating levels of accumulated child support debt, relating in particular to child support penalties, is increasingly becoming an issue. 20. Many people therefore consider that the scheme is now, in many cases, out of date. This undermines some parents' incentives to meet their child support obligations, and is detrimental to the wellbeing of some children. Specific policy problems 21. Some paying parents are concerned that the scheme does not take account of their particular circumstances. For example, they may share the care and costs of their children but have arrangements that do not qualify as "shared care" for the purposes of the child support formula. Parents may also be in a situation where their income, on which child support liability is calculated, is substantially less than that of the receiving parent. 22. Receiving parents, on the other hand, are concerned about non-payment of child support on the part of the paying parent, or the instability of payments. Some consider current payments to be insufficient to meet the costs of caring for their children and do not feel that they accurately reflect the true expenditure of raising children in New Zealand. They may also be concerned about delays in receiving payments. 4 23. For these reasons the Minister of Revenue released a Government discussion document on child support entitled Supporting children in September 2010. 1 24. The discussion document includes detailed analysis of both the current scheme and options for updating the scheme, including revising the child support formula to better recognise shared care, and to take into account the income of both parents and the current expenditure of raising children in New Zealand. Incentives for making child support payments, and making them on time, are also discussed, along with suggestions about how these could be improved. 25. The main policy problems considered were: • whether the current child support system accurately reflects the expenditure for raising children in varying family circumstances in New Zealand; • whether greater levels of shared care and other regular care should be taken into account when calculating child support; • whether both parents' income should be taken into account when calculating the child support to be paid; • whether incentives to make payments can be improved by changing the child support penalty rules and write-off provisions. 26. A dedicated website for online consultation summarised the main options considered in the discussion document and asked readers to respond to a series of questions based on those options. Respondents were also able to provide comments in key areas. Written submissions on the same issues were also received through the normal policy submission process. OBJECTIVES 27. Two primary objectives have been considered in assessing options for amending the child support scheme. These are: • To improve the fairness of the child support scheme so that it reflects social and legal changes which have occurred since its introduction in 1992. • To promote the welfare of the children, in particular by recognising that children are disadvantaged when child support is not paid, or not paid on time. 28. Social changes since the introduction of the scheme mean that there is now a greater emphasis on separated parents sharing the care of their children and there is higher participation in the workforce by receiving parents. 1 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2010-dd-supporting-children/overview 5 29. The disadvantage when child support is not paid is a financial one (particularly when the receiving parent is not on a sole-parent benefit) which may in turn involve emotional detachment from the parent who is not the primary caregiver. A more transparent system with a better targeted payment and penalties system would encourage, or at least not discourage, parents to pay their child support and would help improve the well-being of their children. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 30. A number of different options have been considered to address the objectives of the review. These were all discussed in depth in the Supporting children discussion document, and in a subsequent summary feedback document released in July 2011. 2 31. The purpose of the feedback document was to set out the detailed results of the online consultation. It also provided a summary of the main themes and concerns raised in both the online consultation and in associated written submissions. 32. Broadly speaking, there was majority support for many of the options canvassed, but there were some areas where a significant minority opinion existed. This likely reflects the potential for conflict in the child support area. 33. There were 2,272 participants in the online consultation. They comprised: • 834 receiving parents (37 percent); • 753 paying parents (33 percent); and • 685 "other" parties (30 percent), including those who both pay and receive child support, other family members, members of representative organisations and advocates in child support policy such as lawyers and academics. 34. In order to provide greater context, and a more detailed analysis, the following information on the options considered in this RIS should be read in conjunction with the September 2010 discussion document and the July 2011 summary of feedback. 35. The options to improve on the status quo that have been considered in this RIS are not generally mutually exclusive. They have been placed into the following broad categories: • key changes to update the child support formula; • secondary changes to update the child support scheme more generally; and • changes to amend the payment, penalty and debt rules for child support. 36. The impacts of the options are summarised in the following tables.

While any change in the child support formula could have a material impact for a minority of parents, the overall objective of any change should be to achieve a fairer outcome that encourages more parents to pay their outstanding child support liabilities voluntarily. The following options in relation to the child support formula were considered with this in mind. Option 1: Recognising up-to-date estimates on the expenditure for raising children (recommended with options 2 and 3) 38. The first option considered is for the child support formula to better recognise actual and up-to-date estimates on the expenditure for raising children in New Zealand. 39. Until recently, there was little specific New Zealand research on estimated expenditures for raising children in New Zealand. Research on this subject was therefore conducted in 2009 by Inland Revenue officials. 3 This research followed equivalent Australian studies on the cost of raising children as far as possible, but with New Zealand data. 40. These up-to-date estimates of expenditure for raising children in New Zealand show that child support payments under a revised child support formula would increase in line with parental income. This reflects the fact that parents with higher incomes generally spend more on their children, with the amount increasing with family income but declining as a proportion of income. To recognise this decline, and to not discourage parents from earning extra income, the discussion document recommended that, if this option was adopted, an income cap should be retained. Income above the cap would not be recognised for child support purposes. 41. The research also showed that expenditure for raising children rises with the age of the children, with teenagers costing more than younger children. Also, due to economies of scale, each additional child generally costs less than the last. The discussion document recommended that these factors be taken into account were this option adopted. 42. Results of the online consultation indicated that: • 54 percent of respondents thought that child support payments should vary depending on the income of the parents, whereas the other 46 percent thought that it should be based on a fixed estimate of how much expenditure is needed to raise a child in any situation. • 58 percent thought that child support payments should be higher for teenagers than for children under 13. • 60 percent thought that there should be an income cap for the purposes of calculating child support payments. 3 http://vww.nzae.org.nz/conferences/2009/pdfs/Costs\_of\_raising\_children\_NZAE\_paper\_v2.pdf 12 Option 2: Reducing the current shared-care threshold (recommended with options 1 and 3) 43. Changes to patterns of parenting have occurred since the Child Support Act was introduced and it is now more common for both parents to be actively involved in raising their children. 44. The current child support scheme can, in some cases, provide disincentives to parents sharing the care of their children. The scheme does not recognise the significant expenditures some parents incur while trying to retain a significant role in their children's upbringing. This may affect the paying parent's willingness or ability to meet their child support obligations or to maintain any significant level of care. 45. When both parents have regular care of their children, expenditures for the paying parent increase with an associated (but disproportionately lower) reduction in the receiving parent's expenditures. This is because of a loss of the economies of scale that exist in two- parent families. 46. If the child support scheme is to recognise greater levels of shared care a key question to be addressed is whether the expenditures incurred by both parents need to be borne in a more equitable way. 47. A greater level of recognition could be given to lower levels of shared and regular care being provided by paying parents, by lowering the current shared-care threshold of 40 percent of nights. One of the main criticisms in this area is that this test for recognising shared care is too high and also creates a "cliff' effect. A "cliff' effect means that there can be a substantial change in the amount of child support payable, depending on whether or not shared care is established at the prescribed level. 48. Sixty nine percent of the respondents to the online consultation thought that the current 40 percent for shared care should be lowered to include other levels of regular care. 49. Various levels of care have been considered by officials. One option is to recognise, on a tiered basis, care in excess of 28 percent of annual care (on average two nights a week). This would provide recognition to those paying parents who provide high levels of care, but who are unable to satisfy the current 40 percent threshold. 50. If the tiered approach from 28 percent of care was adopted, it could be based on Table 1: Table 1 Number of nights of care Proportion of net expenditure for annually child considered incurred Oto 103 Nil (0% to less than 28%) 104 to 126 24% (28% to less than 35%) 127 to 175 25% plus 0.5% for each night over (35% to less than 48%) 127 nights 176 to 182 50% (48% to 50%) 13 51. Alternatively, care could be recognised, again on a tiered basis, where it is in excess of 14 percent of annual care (on average one night a week). This is the threshold adopted in some other jurisdictions (for example, in Australia and Britain). Although this option would provide recognition to more paying parents who care for their children, it may be seen as too generous, particularly when the majority of everyday and other significant one-off costs are still being borne by receiving parents. It would also involve a greater fiscal cost as more child support liabilities would be reduced, thereby further reducing the amount received by the Government to offset benefit payments to receiving parents. 52. Under either of these tiered approaches, paying parents would have the care they provide acknowledged at a given rate, with higher levels of care reflected in a corresponding adjustment in the child support liability according to their income levels. This would recognise the additional expenditures incurred. 53. One of the main advantages of a tiered approach is that once shared care is confirmed, subsequent small increases in levels of care would not give rise to major changes in child support for either parent. There would be less of a cliff effect, with a series of smaller incremental adjustments instead. 54. Another alternative is to have a single, but lower, single shared-care threshold. This would maintain the simplicity of the current shared-care rules and would allow more paying parents to benefit from the shared-care rules, thus recognising their contributions towards raising their children. Regardless, wherever such a threshold level would be set, it would be seen as arbitrary and still create a noticeable cliff effect. Option 3: Taking both parents' income into account (recommended with options 1 and 2) 55. Taking the income of both parents into account when determining levels of child support payment better reflects the realities of modern-day parenting and parents' relative abilities to contribute towards the expenditure for raising their children. It assumes that both parents should be financially responsible for raising their child. 56. Under this option, expenditures for raising children would be worked out based on the parents' combined income, with the expenditure distributed between parents in accordance with their respective shares of that combined income and their level of care of the child. This option is linked with option 2. 57. The main advantages of an income-shares approach are: • It is transparent. It provides an estimate of how much is being contributed by each parent towards the support of their children. • It better reflects parents' relative abilities to financially contribute towards raising their children and parallels likely expenditure by those parents as if they were in a two-parent household in which both parents have income. • It makes processes relating to changes of financial circumstances clearer and simpler. If there is a reduction in the income of either parent, this can be automatically reflected in the contribution calculation, potentially removing the need for an administrative review. 14 58. Disadvantages of the income-shares approach are: • If the receiving parent's income varies significantly - for example, to accommodate the needs of children to be cared for - there is potential to increase conflict between parents, as the paying parent's child support contribution would also vary. • The approach could make the level of payments less secure, as a change in either parent's income may result in a change in child support payable or receivable. 59. However, these disadvantages need to be balanced against the reality that changes in either parent's work patterns do affect their children and would do so if the parents were living together. Ideally, any formula adopted should reflect this reality. 60. On balance, the advantages of the income-shares approach seem to outweigh the possible disadvantages. 61. Work incentives seem to be neither advantaged nor disadvantaged overall from taking both incomes into account. Some receiving parents could be discouraged from participating in the workforce because a portion of every dollar they earned over the self-support amount would be "lost" through a decrease in the child support they received. On the other hand, there may be a greater incentive for paying parents to earn higher incomes if they were paying less in child support as a result of both incomes being taken into account. 62. Sixty eight percent of the respondents to the online consultation felt that the income of both parents should always be included in working out the amount of child support payable. 63. Whether the income of a new partner should be taken into account when calculating child support liabilities has also been considered. Officials' view is that such income should not be automatically included, since the nature of a formula is that it cannot reflect what a new partner's involvement (financially or otherwise) will be in a child's life. In some cases a new partner effectively becomes a new parent, while in others that is not the case. The administrative review process is available where a parent considers that the income of a new partner should be taken into account. Option 4: Introducing a revised child support formula, taking options 1-3 into account (recommended option) 64. Although options 1-3 can be considered in isolation, it would be preferable to have all of these three elements taken into account when considering wider changes to the child support formula. Doing so would result in a comprehensive change to the formula, incorporating: • basing child support payments on estimated average expenditures for raising children in New Zealand; • recognising lower levels of care; and • taking the income of both parents into account. 15 65. The alternative options of only incorporating one or two of these options would limit the overall impact and effectiveness of any change. They would represent a less comprehensive and less transparent solution. 66. Sixty nine percent of the respondents to the online consultation thought that all these factors should be used to work out child support payments. Most written submissions also indicated a preference for comprehensive change rather than change in just one area. 67. A comprehensive new formula could have the following characteristics: • It would incorporate lower levels of shared care (for example, by way of tiered thresholds from 28 percent of nights) to deal with concerns about insufficient recognition of regular and shared care of children. • To deal with concerns about the capacity to pay, both parents' incomes would be included in the formula, with payments being apportioned according to each parent's share of total income. Where there were other dependent children, a parent's income would be reduced for the assumed expenditure for those children, before calculating their child support contribution. • The formula would use a new scale of income percentages that reflected up-to- date information on the net (of average tax benefits) expenditures for raising children in New Zealand. These percentages would vary with: - the number of children; - the age of the children (the percentage would be higher for children over 12 years); and - the combined income of the parents. 68. Table 2 sets out how the expenditures for raising children calculation would look for the purposes of the revised formula. The expenditures used would be adjusted each year to keep up to date with average earnings. 16 Table 2: Expenditure for raising children matrix Parents' combined child support income (income above the living allowance amounts) 1 Number of children $0- $24,081 2 $24,082 - $48,162 3 $48,163- $72,243 4 $72,244- $96,324 s $96,325 - $120,405 6 Over $120,405 6 Expenditure for raising children (to be apportioned between the parents) Children aged 0-12 years 1 child 17c for each $1 $4,094 plus 15c for each $1 over $24,081 $7,706 plus 12c for each $1 over $48,162 $10,596 plus 10c for each $1 over $72,243 $13,004 plus 7c for each $1 over $96,324 $14,689 2 children 24c for each $1 $5,779 plus 23c for each $1 over $24,081 $11,318 plus 20c for each $1 over $48,162 $16,134 plus 18c for each $1 over $72,243 $20,469 plus 10c for each $1 over $96,324 $22,877 3+ children 27c for each $1 $6,502 plus 26c for each $1 over $24,081 $12,763 plus 25c for each $1 over $48,162 $18,783 plus 24c for each $1 over $72,243 $24,563 plus 18c for each $1 over $96,324 $28,897 Children aged 13+ years 1 child 23c for each $1 $5,539 plus 22c for each $1 over $24,081 $10,836 plus 12c for each $1 over $48,162 $13,726 plus 10c for each $1 over $72,243 $16,134 plus 9c for each $1 over $96,324 $18,302 2 children 29c for each $1 $6,983 plus 28c for each $1 over $24,081 $13,726 plus 25c for each $1 over $48,162 $19,746 plus 20c for each $1 over $72,243 $24,563 plus 13 c for each $1 over $96,324 $27,693 3+ children 32c for each $1 $7,706 plus 31c for each $1 over $24,081 $15,171 plus 30c for each $1 over $48,162 $22,395 plus 29c for each $1 over $72,243 $29,379 plus 20c for each $1 over $96,324 $34,195 Children of mixed age\* 2 children 26.5c for each $1 $6,381 plus 25.5c for each $1 over $24,081 $12,522 plus 22.5c for each $1 over $48,162 $17,940 plus 19c for each $1 over $72,243 $22,515 plus 11.5c for each $1 over $96,324 $25,285 3+ children 29.5c for each $1 $7,104 plus 28.5c for each $1 over $24,081 $13,967 plus 27.5c for each $1 over $48,162 $20,589 plus 26.5c for each $1 over $72,243 $26,971 plus 19c for each $1 over $96,324 $31,546 1 Calculated by adding the two parents' child support incomes, that is, adding each parent's adjusted taxable income minus their living allowance of $16,054 (1/3 of Average Weekly Earnings (AWE)). 2 .5 of AWE. 3 AWE. 4 1.5 times AWE. 5 2 times AWE. 6 2.5 times AWE. Expenditure for raising children does not increase above this cap. Note that this equates to a cap at a combined adjusted taxable income of $152,514. \* The rates are the average of the two previous age categories. 17 How this approach would work in practice 69. Under a new formula, each parent would be allocated a standard living allowance that would be deducted from his or her respective taxable income. If the net amount was negative, the taxable income would be treated as zero. 70. The two net amounts would be combined and each amount expressed as a percentage of this total. These proportions would then be applied to the expenditure relevant for that child so that the expenditure for raising the child or children would be split between the two parents based on their relative net incomes. 71. Each parent's percentage of shared care would then be deducted from the result to produce a net liability for one of the parents. This would be the parent whose shared-care percentage is less than his or her share of total net income. 72. To recognise the care a parent provides for other dependent children, an amount (in addition to the living allowance) would be deducted from the parent's adjusted taxable income before applying the basic formula. This amount would be calculated in the same way as the calculation described above. In this way other dependant children would be treated the same way as children subject to child support. Summary impacts and recommendations 73. There are wide-ranging views about what a fairer and more effective scheme might look like and how to achieve this, and it will never be possible to design rules to satisfy all concerned. There are too many conflicting interests and points of view. Officials consider, however, that this option provides the best opportunity of introducing a revised formula that represents a fair reflection of the expenditure for raising children, the parents' contribution to care and the parents' capacity to pay. This, in turn, should better encourage parents to pay their child support and therefore improve the well-being of their children. For these reasons the proposed child support formula is considered a significant improvement over the current one. 74. These changes to the child support formula would have financial implications for parents. Tables 3A and 3B show the estimated affects on parents. Overall, it is estimated that 70,502 parents would be better off under the changes (that is, they will receive more or pay less child support) and 62,467 worse off (that is, they will receive less or pay more). 75. For the majority of parents whose child support will be affected, the change in child support received and paid is likely to be between plus or minus $66 per month (plus or minus $800 per year). 18 76. For a large percentage of receiving and paying parents (60 percent and 40 percent respectively), the changes to the formula would not result in any change in the amounts received or paid. For 140,053 parents, there would be no change. This is because many parents would continue to either receive a sole-parent benefit (and therefore not receive child support payments directly) or continue to pay the minimum contribution because their income level is below the minimum level for child support purposes. For those who would be affected, however, the resulting change would represent a more transparent and equitable result in a greater number of different circumstances. 77. Over 82 percent of current child support received and about 74 percent of child support paid would therefore either be unaffected or affected to the extent of plus or minus $66 per month (plus or minus $800 per year). 78. Parents who would qualify for the wider recognition of shared care would be most affected, with paying parents likely to pay less in such cases. Consequently, the means by and extent to which regular care is recognised is important to the overall outcome for both parents. If shared care were recognised at 28 percent, there would be nearly as many receiving parents who would receive more (24,505 parents) as receiving parents who would receive less (29,776 parents). For paying parents, 32,691 parents would pay more and 45,997 79. These impacts will in some cases be reduced, as changes in the amount of child support received or paid affects the amount of Working for Families tax credits received. 19 Table 3B: Monthly change in child support payments Paying parents 70,000 - Increase in monthly child support payments Reduction in monthly child support payments $ change per month 80. The approach taken to the review process was to categorise the parents into 'paying parents' and 'receiving parents' - being a 'receiving parent' is generally indicative of being the primary caregiver, and this can be the mother, the father, or another person. That said, as the majority (but certainly not all) of receiving parents are female, women are more likely to be adversely affected by this change. 20 81. Taking both female paying and female receiving parents into account, it is projected that 25,954 of these parents would receive more or pay less child support and 31,428 of these parents would receive less or pay more child support. The majority (83,039) would be unaffected. 82. Female parents who would be affected by the changes and who have taxable incomes of less than $20,000 may both receive more/pay less or receive less/pay more child support. About half of all female parents who would receive less or pay more have taxable incomes of $20,000 or less. Likewise, about half of the female parents who would receive more or pay less also have taxable incomes of $20,000 or less. Many of these parents will also receive non taxable Working for Families tax credits, and many may be partnered. 83. As their position is not affected by the changes, receiving parents who remain on a sole parent benefit would continue to receive full benefit levels. 84. Taking both male paying and male receiving parents into account, it is projected that 44,307 of these parents would receive more or pay less child support and 30,750 of these parents would receive less or pay more child support. 56,191 would be unaffected by the proposed formula. 85. About half of all males who would pay more or receive less would have taxable incomes of lower than $40,000. On the other hand, nearly 65 percent of the males who would pay less or receive more child support have taxable incomes of $40,000 or less. Fiscal implications 86. The fiscal implications (including administrative costs) of introducing a comprehensive new child support formula, recognising shared care at 28 percent, are as follows: Table 4 Costs 2011/12 ($m) 2012/13 ($m) 2013/14 ($m) 2014/15 ($m) 2015/16 & outyears ($m) Child support - Administrative costs in implementing new formula 2.887 10.417 6.758 2.906 1.837 - Revenue costs (formula change including reducing shared care to 28%\*\*) - 0.500 2.250 3.750 6.000 \*\* This assumes an additional 10% of parents would qualify for shared care (currently only about 5% of parental relationships qualify), ll is estimated that the number of parents who qualify would increase from approximately 7,000 to 20,000. Secondary changes to update the child support scheme more generally 87. Although the following options for change to the child support scheme more generally are separate from the child support formula itself, they nevertheless affect the ability to claim child support and/or the amount of child support payable or receivable. 21 Measuring and recognising shared care Option 5: Recognising shared care using a test other than "number of nights" (partially recommended) 88. Whether parents have shared care for child support purposes is generally determined by the number of nights of care the parents each provide. However, this test does not necessarily produce the correct outcome, as there are occasions when very significant (and costly) daytime care is provided by paying parents. Consideration was therefore given to establishing whether another test (for example, based on days or time in general) could be used for determining shared care. 89. It is considered, however, that the number of nights that a child spends with a parent is still the best and easiest method of establishing care levels in the first instance. Overnight care invariably necessitates the provision of accommodation, travel and food. Also, it is generally easy to establish how many nights a child spends with a parent. The administrative review process can still, however, provide departures from this test on a case-by-case basis if the costs of daytime contact are significant. 90. Consideration has also been given to providing departures by way of a Commissioner discretion. A Commissioner discretion would result in a process that was potentially simpler and more straightforward than the current administration review process for cases in which the costs of daytime contact are significant. Option 6: Relying on parenting orders and agreements (recommended) 91. An option mooted in the discussion document was that Inland Revenue should be able to rely on a parenting order or agreement to establish the number of nights a child spends with each parent for child support purposes. This would result in more efficient processing of shared-care applications. It would also reinforce what the courts have determined to be in the best interests of the children. This initiative would extend to parenting agreements which, while not enforceable by the courts, nonetheless convey the intentions and expectations of both parents. 92. If this option were to be adopted, parents should be able to rebut a presumption made on the basis of a parenting order or agreement when it could be shown that the order or agreement was not being followed in practice. A new administrative review ground and Commissioner discretion would be required for this purpose. The onus of proving that the order or agreement was not being adhered to would rest with the parent making the challenge. Defining income and measuring payment levels Option 7: Changing the definition of income for child support purposes (recommended) 93. "Income" for child support purposes should, in general, continue to be defined as taxable income. However, important changes have been made to the way that income is defined for the purposes of Working for Families tax credits, and these changes should be considered for child support purposes. 22 94. In particular, from 1 April 2011, losses, including losses from rental properties, are added back so that these losses cannot be used to reduce income when assessing eligibility for Working for Families tax credits. Making a similar change for child support purposes, on the basis that this would better reflect the real income that families would normally have available to them, has been considered. Likewise, ensuring that trustee income is counted as part of a family's total income has been considered in the child support context. 95. Such rules were implemented to counter families structuring their affairs to inflate entitlements to social assistance (or reduce liabilities). These rules would also help maintain the child support scheme's integrity. Option 8: Recognising re-establishment costs (recommended) 96. A paying or receiving parent will frequently take on additional employment or overtime to help re-establish themselves after a separation - for example, to buy an alternative family home. Currently, income from secondary employment and overtime is automatically included in the formula calculation. 97. Trying to incorporate recognition of all re-establishment costs into the child support formula would not be appropriate. Instead, re-establishment costs, for a period of three years after a relationship separation, could become a ground for an administrative review. This could be subject to a parent (either receiving or paying) meeting requirements that the income that was used to pay for the re-establishment costs was earned in accordance with a pattern that was established after the parents first separated and that any excluded income in respect of the re-establishment costs is no more than 30 percent of taxable income. 98. In the online consultation, 71 percent of the respondents were in favour of such a change. Most written comments were also supportive. Option 9: Allowing prescribed payments (recommended) 99. A further option is to provide the Commissioner with the discretion to allow certain payments to count towards a paying parent's child support liability. Currently, payments made by a paying parent are not credited against their child support liability. Introducing the ability to do so is likely to provide a greater incentive to pay child support, as a paying parent may be more comfortable that the payment (or at least part of it) is directly benefiting the child according to the paying parent's desires for the child's upbringing. 100. For a payment to be recognised, however, it would ideally need to have both parents' agreement, as parents' views about expenditure choices may differ. Alternatively, it would need to be of a prescribed type - for example, childcare costs for the relevant child; fees charged by a school or preschool for that child; amounts payable for uniforms and books prescribed by a school or preschool for that child; or fees for essential medical and dental services for that child. 101. Credit could be given up to a maximum of 30 percent of the ongoing liability, provided the balance of child support is paid as it becomes due. This facility should not, however, be available to parents whose child support liability has been adjusted to reflect shared care. Nor should it be available if the receiving parent receives a sole-parent benefit only, as the 23 Government is already in effect providing contributions towards these payments as part of that benefit. 102. In the online consultation, 81 percent of the respondents were in favour of such a change. Most written comments were also supportive. Determining eligibility Option 10: Reducing the qualifying age of children (recommended) 103. Currently, child support is normally payable until a child reaches the age of 19 years. However, many children start higher education before this age (or are able to work or claim a benefit in their own right) and so have access to the student loan and student allowance schemes. 104. It is therefore recommended that the qualifying age should be changed so that child support payments automatically end when the child reaches 18 unless the child is still in full- time secondary education. In that case, the child would cease to be a qualifying child when they left school. 105. In the online consultation, 76 percent of the respondents were in favour of this change. Option 11: Determining who can claim child support (not recommended) 106. Currently, a person can claim child support if he or she is the sole or principal provider of care for a child (or shares that role equally with someone else). There are no other specific requirements or tests that must be satisfied. 107. We have considered introducing restrictions on who is able to claim child support. The ability to claim child support could be restricted to: • a parent of a child; or • someone who has legal custody of a child; or • someone who is entitled to receive a Government benefit for a child. 108. This could address the rare occasions when child support could be considered to be claimed inappropriately (in particular, when teenage children have left home of their own accord to live with an adult other than a parent). However, difficulties could arise if this test were adopted. In particular, if wider family members are caring for a child, it makes sense that they should be able to claim child support regardless of whether they fall into one of the above categories. Safety, care and protection concerns may dictate that a child should not live with his or her parents. This needs to be balanced with the responsibility of parents to stay involved in decisions regarding where their teenage children live (and the financial obligations that flow from this). 24 109. Inland Revenue, being predominantly a collection agency, is not best placed to make judgements that determine who a child should be living with. It would therefore be preferable for Inland Revenue officials to discuss with the Ministry of Social Development and the Ministry of Justice whether an appeal process should be developed whereby parents can challenge, in the Family Court, a child support claim made by another person in the Family Court. Changes to amend the payment, penalty and debt rules for child support 110. Ensuring that child support payments are delivered on time and that payment arrears are dealt with by Inland Revenue as effectively as possible is critical. The following options were considered in order to establish ways to better encourage and facilitate parents to make timely child support payments for the benefit of their children. Making payments of child support Option 12: Automatically deducting child support payments from salary and wages (recommended) 111. In order to ensure that as many payments as possible are made, and made on time, an option is to make it compulsory for all child support payments to be automatically deducted from the employment income of paying parents. Paying parents would therefore have their payments automatically co-ordinated with their pay periods, whether those periods were weekly, fortnightly or monthly. 112. It is recognised that some paying parents have concerns about their employers knowing that they are making child support contributions. However, the public interest in operating an effective child support scheme should arguably outweigh these individual concerns. 113. There may be some, albeit marginal, increased compliance costs for employers from having to make deductions and record and pay the money to Inland Revenue through the PA YE system. The increase in the number of deductions would, however, be small relative to the volumes already being processed at the same time to account for PAYE, ACC and KiwiSaver contributions (and for child support payments that are already being deducted by employers when a default occurs). 114. In the online consultation, 66 percent of the respondents were in favour of this change. Option 13: Passing on child support payments to receiving parents (not recommended) 115. Government-provided welfare benefits give certainty to sole parents about the amount that they will receive to assist them in raising their children. However, some paying parents maintain that they have little incentive to pay child support if their payments are retained by the Crown up to the amount of the benefit paid. The children are no better off as a result of the child support payment, because the benefit is paid regardless. 25 116. "Pass-on" means that, instead of being retained by the Crown, child support payments are passed on to the beneficiary receiving parent. This may increase the incentive to pay child support and improve compliance. It may also provide a greater incentive for receiving parents who are beneficiaries to trace paying parents and to contest the level of contribution if this is considered inadequate or unjust. 117. However, pass-on would involve a very significant fiscal loss to the Government, and this would be reduced only if benefits were wholly or partly offset against benefit payments. Offsetting benefit payments would create uncertainty, and in some cases hardship, for beneficiaries and the children involved, as the overall amount they received would be dependent on whether and how promptly the other parent paid his or her child support contribution. 118. Also, pass-on does not ensure that child support payments are applied for the benefit of the child, which would be important in increasing any incentives to pay. 119. Some countries that have pass-on have used it to emphasise the welfare of the children when child poverty has been the central concern, and also when child support payment rates have been of concern. However, New Zealand's child support collection rate for assessed child support compares well with other countries, lessening the incentive to introduce pass-on without strong evidence to support such a change. Incentivising payments Option 14: Reducing child support penalty rates (recommended) 120. Currently, paying parents who fail to pay in full and on time incur an initial penalty of 10 percent of the unpaid amount. A further penalty of 2 percent of the unpaid amount is imposed on a compounding basis for each month that the amount remains outstanding. 121. Penalties play an important role in encouraging parents to meet their child support obligations. If they are excessive, however, they can discourage the payment of child support to the detriment of the children concerned. Child support debt, as at 30 June 2011, stands at $2,27lm. This figure is made up of child support assessments of $605m and associated penalties of $1,656m. 122. These figures show the magnitude of the problem. Various options have therefore been considered in relation to changing child support penalty rates. 123. In respect of initial penalties, a 10 percent penalty for any late payment may be seen as excessive if the payment was late only because of an oversight. 124. An option therefore is to implement a two-stage initial penalty whereby a paying parent is charged 2 percent if the payment is not made on time but is only charged the remaining 8 percent if the amount remains unpaid after 7 days. This gives the paying parent a week to make any payments inadvertently not made, therefore encouraging positive behaviour and decreasing the level of unpaid debt. This approach also better mirrors the two-stage treatment adopted for the initial late payment of tax debts. 26 125. The cumulative nature of the 2 percent incremental penalty means that penalty amounts can grow rapidly, often vastly outstripping the original debt. At some point, parents who would otherwise be willing to pay off their assessed liability may become reluctant to approach Inland Revenue to do so. The high penalty levels could be acting as a disincentive to compliance. 126. Reducing the incremental penalty from 2 percent would help prevent the current rapid rate of escalation for penalty debt, and it would stop the debt reaching levels that paying parents feel are disproportionate to the original debt. A lower monthly penalty rate is therefore recommended. 127. A reduction of the incremental monthly penalty from 2 percent to 1 percent after a year of non-compliance by the paying parent would reduce these disincentives. 128. If the incremental monthly penalty rate is reduced from 2 percent to 1 percent after one year's non-compliance, other offsetting enforcement measures should be implemented. This would see paying parents being subject to more intensive case management from Inland Revenue. 129. In the online consultation, 65 percent of the respondents were in favour of making this change. Option 15: Other penalty options considered (not recommended) 130. Some of the other penalty options considered, but not recommended by officials, include: • Capping the amount of penalties that could apply to a parent's child support debt. This would stop debt accumulating and may reduce the reluctance that some parents have in contacting Inland Revenue. However, once the cap was reached, there would be limited further incentive for paying parents to continue to pay their child support liability. • Aligning child support penalties to tax penalties and use-of-money interest. Although this could provide administrative efficiencies for Inland Revenue, there are many differences between the two systems that mean that tax penalties and interest are not fully relevant to child support (for example, child support is fundamentally collected on behalf of the receiving parent, not the Crown). Option 16: Amending penalty write-off rules (recommended) 131. Although the primary objective of any changes to the penalty rules should be to progressively recover any existing assessed debt and establish the regular payment of child support liabilities, writing off penalties in certain circumstances may help facilitate regular payment or, alternatively, be justifiable on hardship grounds. 27 132. Some options considered in this regard include: • relaxing the circumstances in which penalties can be written off, including when a paying parent agrees and adheres to an instalment arrangement for ongoing compliance; • allowing Inland Revenue to automatically write off low levels of penalty-only debt below a certain value (to be determined periodically by Inland Revenue). 133. The starting position for writing off penalties should ideally be that a paying parent who comes to Inland Revenue to arrange the payment of a debt is trying to comply. On that basis, one option considered is that if an agreed amount is to be written off, it should be written off at the start of an instalment arrangement (rather than after a significant period of positive compliance, as is currently the case). 134. This option would relax the circumstances in which penalties can be written off for ongoing compliance, as all that would be required would be an agreed instalment arrangement. If the paying parent defaults again, new late-payment penalties could be applied. Written-off debt should ideally not be reinstated unless, for example, the write-off is based on false or misleading information provided by the paying parent. 135. To avoid deliberate exploitation of such write-off rules, Inland Revenue could be able to decline to enter into an instalment arrangement when a paying parent has not complied with a previous arrangement and there has been no due cause for this non-compliance. 136. Another connected option is to allow Inland Revenue a wider range of options to negotiate the write-off of penalties if the paying parent would be placed in significant hardship or if it would be a demonstrably inefficient use of Inland Revenue's resources to collect the debt because the chances of collection are very low. To ensure transparency and consistency, such a provision would be supported by published administrative guidelines or criteria. 137. An additional option is to allow Inland Revenue to automatically write off low levels of penalty-only debt (when assessed debt has been paid and only penalty debt remains). This discretion would allow Inland Revenue, once all assessed child support debt has been paid, to automatically write off all penalty-only debt below a certain value (to be determined by Inland Revenue on the basis of set published criteria and guidelines) 138. In the online consultation, 55 percent of the respondents were in favour of relaxing the ability to write off child support debt in certain circumstances. Option 17: Allowing certain assessed child support debt to be written off (recommended) 139. Inland Revenue cannot currently write off assessed debt because, in many cases, the debt is owed to the receiving parent for the care of the child. When a receiving parent is not on a sole-parent benefit, however, that parent can instruct Inland Revenue to waive the assessed debt. 28 140. Inland Revenue does not have an equivalent discretion to waive assessed debt owed to the Crown when a parent receives a sole-parent benefit. The courts can order a debt to be written off, but this is costly and time-consuming. 141. An option considered is to allow assessed debt relating to beneficiaries to be written off by Inland Revenue on serious hardship grounds. Similar allowance already exists in relation to tax debt — for example, when someone has a serious illness and is unable to work, or is otherwise unable to meet minimum living standards. Option 18: Other penalty write-off options considered (not recommended) 142. Some of the other penalty write-off options considered, but not recommended by officials, include: • Introducing a child support debt amnesty whereby if all existing assessed debt was paid off during prescribed period, all associated penalties would be automatically written off. Although this would result in recovery of arrears, it would not be likely to change the long-term behaviour of errant paying parents. It would also see persistent failure to comply being rewarded, which would send the wrong message about the fairness of the child support scheme more generally. • Passing on penalty payments received to the receiving parent. If this option were adopted, receiving parents would be compensated for their loss of funds. However, passing on penalties would be complex to administer and would also create inconsistencies in the treatment of different receiving parents. It is uncertain whether this measure would act as an additional incentive for paying parents to comply. Estimated fiscal costs of changes to the payment, penalty and debt rules for child support 143. The recommended changes to the child support payment, penalty and debt rules noted above are estimated to have a fiscal cost of around $10 million per annum. This estimate takes into account the fact that, although child support penalties are included in the Government's accounts as income, those accounts also include a provision for writing off 97 percent of the amount of that income. 144. The fiscal implications over the forecast period are as follows: Cost 2011/12 ($m) 2012/13 ($m) 2013/14 ($m) 2014/15 ($m) 2015/16 & outyears ($m) Child support - Administrative costs (included in formula changes) - Revenue (incl. reducing penalty rates) -- 2.500 10.000 10.000 29 145. The options that are designed to increase compliance would, however, also create additional cash flows and a reduction in future expenses to the Crown, and would help defray some of this fiscal cost. Although not included above (as improved compliance is difficult to predict and measure), it is estimated that a 1 percent increase in the amount of child support paid to the Crown would have a positive fiscal impact of around $2 million per annum. Lower penalty rates would also slow down the accumulation of child support debt. CONSULTATION 146. As noted previously, a significant level of public consultation has been undertaken on the options for potential child support reform. 147. There has also been consultation with a range of Government agencies on child support issues over a period of time. This consultation was with the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Women's Affairs, the Treasury and the Families Commission. Feedback from these agencies has, wherever possible, been incorporated into the formulation of the policy options discussed here. There is a general recognition from these agencies that the various issues with the child support scheme need to be addressed. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 148. It is recommended that the child support formula be amended to better recognise shared care and to take account of the income of both parents and the expenditure for raising children in New Zealand (option 4). Doing so would provide more equitable financial support for children in a variety of circumstances. It would also better reflect many of the social and legal changes that have occurred since the introduction of the current scheme in 1992, in particular the greater emphasis on separated parents sharing the care of and financial responsibility for their children. 149. We also recommend: • changes to the operation of the formula to update the child support scheme more generally (Options 5a, 6, 7, 8, 9,10); and • changes to the rules relating to the payment of child support, the imposition of penalties, and the writing-off of penalties and debt to better encourage and facilitate parents to make timely child support payments for the benefit of their children (Options 12, 14a, 14b, 16a, 16b, 17). 30 150. The total fiscal impact of all the recommended proposals, together with associated administration costs for their implementation, is: Cost 2011/12 ($m) 2012/13 ($m) 2013/14 ($m) 2014/15 ($m) 2015/16 & outyears ($m) Revenue costs of introducing proposed new child support formula - 0.500 2.250 3.750 6.000 Revenue costs of proposed changes to the payment, penalty and write-off rules -- 2.500 10.000 10.000 Total Inland Revenue administrative costs in implementing proposals 2.887 10.417 6.758 2.906 1.837 Total 2.887 10.917 11.508 16.656 17.837 IMPLEMENTATION 151. Significant changes to the child support scheme would require amendments to the Child Support Act 1991 and to any consequential provisions in other legislation. These amendments would be included in a Child Support Amendment Bill 2011, planned for introduction in September 2011. Implementation dates 152. To allow for the required significant changes to Inland Revenue's systems and processes, the earliest possible implementation date for changes to the child support formula is 1 April 2013. Changes relating to the payment, penalty and debt rules, and other changes to the scheme, would be introduced on 1 April 2014. 153. Various implementation risks have been identified with introducing significant child support formula changes by 1 April 2013. Given existing systems constraints, Inland Revenue is not able to make the necessary changes required through its computer system (FIRST) by this date. 154. As a temporary measure for the period from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014, therefore, an existing information technology product owned by Inland Revenue would be used to automate the calculation of child support assessments under the new formula. This would occur outside of FIRST. Data would be drawn from FIRST, and then revised information would be uploaded back into the FIRST system for the updating and issuing of the annual assessment. A more manual option would be available for ad hoc calculations or situations in which information is not available within FIRST. 155. The process would be developed as a temporary measure while the necessary changes and testing were made to the FIRST system for full integration by 1 April 2014. 156. Inland Revenue considers that there are some risks associated with this solution, but they are manageable. 31 MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 157. In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of any child support changes would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi- stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. 158. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following repeal would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 32
Regulatory Impact Statement Extending pay-period assessments to salaries and wages of all student loan borrowers Agency Disclosure Statement Inland Revenue has prepared this Regulatory Impact Statement. The Statement analyses the problem of whether the pay-period assessment policy should be extended to the salary and wage earnings of all student loan borowers. Proposed amendments in the Student Loan Scheme Bill 2010 move certain student loan borrowers from annual assessments to pay-period assessments (with no end-oÊyear square- ups). The proposed amendments are designed to apply only in cases where there are no business and investment losses that could be used to offset salary and wage earnings and result in a lower student loan repayment obligation. However, the Budget 2011 announcement that losses are to be excluded from repayment calculations means that pay- period assessments can no\\ / be extended to all student loan borrowers who earn salary and wages. The main objective is to treat all salary and wage earnings consistently in order to simplify the student loan scheme, improve equity and provide certainty. Other than set out in this Disclosure Statement, no significant gaps, assumptions, dependencies, constraints, caveats or uncertainties have been identified. Extensive consultation was undertaken during the development of the wider proposals to transform the student loan administration. This included a discussion document, an online forum and submissions on the Student Loan Scheme Bill 2010. Officials consider that further public consultation on the extension of the pay-period policy to all salary and wage earnings is not necessary given the wide initial consultation. The recommended policy proposals do not impose additional compliance costs, impair private property rights, reduce market competition, provide disincentives to innovate and invest or overide fundamental common law principles. Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 26ltly 2011 raigLatham STATUS QUO A¡ID PROBLEM DEF'INITION 1. The Student Loan Scheme Bill 2010 (the bill) introduces policy changes that improve the overall integrity of the student loan scheme, reduce compliance costs and relieve administrative pressures. The Regulatory Impact Statement Transþrming student loan administration accompanying that bill provides analysis of those changes. 2. This Regulatory Impact Statement considers the impact of extending one of the policy changes in the bill in light of the Budget 2011 announcement that losses would be excluded from repayment calculations. Specifically, this analysis considers the problem of whether the pay-period assessment policy should be extended to the salary and wage earnings of all student loan borrowers, including those making other income (or losses). 3. Currently, student loan collection is based on an end-of-year square-up where a student's overall repayments are calculated by reference to their annual income. Proposed amendments in the bill provide for a move to a pay-period assessment, where the amount earned in any pay-period is assessed against a weekly, fortnightly or monthly repayment threshold and there is no annual square-up. 4. Under the amendments proposed in the bill, borrowers who earn salary and wages are treated as falling into one of three groups: Referred to as 1. Salary and wage borrowers2. Pre-taxed income borrowers Income earned a Salary and wages Pre-taxed incomel less than $1,500 No other income (including business and rental income) a 3. Other income borrowers aa Salary and wages Pre-taxed income more than $1,500 No other income (including business and rental income) ao 5. The other income borrowers (category 3 above) may have had losses from investments or business activity that could be used to offset (reduce) their salary and wage earnings, leading to a reduced student loan repayment obligation. They were excluded from the pay- period assessment policy in the bill in order to reflect their income after losses are taken into account. a Reoavment oblisations May have salary and wages and/or pre-taxed income Does have other income (including business and rental income) a o All obligations met through pay- period assessments. No end-of-year square-up required. a a I Pre-taxed income includes New Zealand-based investment income, casual agricultural eamings, and election day worker eamrngs. 2 All obligations relating to salary and wage earnings met through pay-period assessments. Separate end-of-year square-up for pre-taxed income only. Oa End-of-year square-up including all income earned during the year. 6. In the 2011 Budget, it was announced that losses from investments or business activity will no longer be included when calculating a borrower's repayment obligation. This removes the need to distinguish between borrowers who receive other income and borrowers who do not. In principle, pay-period assessments can now be extended to all salary and wage earnings.OBJECTIVES7. The main objective is to treat all salary and wage earnings consistently in order to simplify the student loan scheme, improve equity and provide certainty to student loan borrowers with salary and wage earnings. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 8. Prior to the 2011 Budget announcements, the end-of-year square-up for other income student loan borrowers was required in order to take into account losses that could reduce student loan repayment obligations. Given that losses are now not taken into account in assessing a student loan borrower's repayment obligations in respect of wages and salary, there is no need to retain the distinction between the salary and wage earnings of a borrower who earns other income and a borrower who does not. 9. The preferred option is therefore to extend pay-period assessments to all salary and wage earnings. The key features of this option for other income borrowers (category 3 in the table above) are: FeatureEnd-of-yearsquare-up Underdeductions Status ouo a All income including salary and wage earnings is squared up. Over deductions a Significant under deductions are collected in the PAYE system. Smaller amounts are collected in the end-of-vear souare-un. a Secondary employment a Significant over deductions are credited in the end-of-year square- up. Smaller amounts are credited in the end-of-vear square-up. Full time study a Preferred ontion a a Borrowers may face a higher repayment rate and must wait for the end-of-year square-up to receive any over deductions. Other income and pre-taxed income is squared up. Salary and wage earnings are not. o o Borrowers cannot apply for the full time study exemption and must wait for the end-of-year square-up to receive any over-deductions. a Significant under deductions are collected in the PAYE system. Smaller amounts are isnored. a a Significant over deductions can be refunded during the year. Smaller amounts are ignored. a O Boruowers can apply for a reduced repayment rate and have the correct amount deducted. a Borrowers can apply for the exemption and receive immediate relief from deductions. 10. Consequently, the effects that the preferred option has on other income borrowers (category 3) in respect of their repayment obligations are: . all obligations relating to salary and wage earnings are met through pay-period assessments; and o there is a separate end-oÊyear square-up for pre-taxed income and other income only. 11. The proposed changes would increase student loan repayments by approximately $5 million per year from the 2012-13 tax year. 12. We have not identified any other options that would have the benefit of treating salary and wage earnings consistently. Benefits of the preferred option 13. The benefrts are that other income borrowers would: ooa be treated consistently; face the same repayment obligations with the same salary and wage earnings; receive fairer treatment in cases of significant over deductions, secondary employment and full time study; and have certainty fhat their salary and wage repayment obligations were being met through their deductions. Costs of the preferred option 14. Student loan borrowers who earn salary or v/ages for part of the year, or whose earnings are irregular, would continue to have the same amount of repayment deductions withheld each pay period. However, they would no longer be able to have their salary and wage earnings squared up, which spreads their income over the whole year and could lower their repayment obligation. In effect, these student loan borrowers would be forced into repaying their student loans more quickly. 15. This change would affect approximately 62,000 borrowers and for two thirds of the affected borrowers the increased obligation would be less than $100 per year. However, as already noted, these borrowers would ultimately benefit from the increased obligation as their loans would be repaid faster. 16. No social, environmental or cultural costs were identified. CONSULTATION 17. Extensive consultation was undertaken during the development of the wider proposals to transform student loan administration. This included a discussion document, an online forum and submissions to the bill. The following departments were consulted during the 2 Not. thut any change that gives rise to an increased repayment obligation results in a borrower repaying their loan more quickly with the borrower retaining the benefit of each payment. 4 bill's development: the Ministry of Education, the Treasury, the Ministry of Social Development (including Studylink), the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, the Commerce Commission and the Privacy Commissioner. 18. Submitters saw the move to a pay-period assessment as a positive step for borrowers who have completed their study. This and related issues were dealt with in the Regulatory Impact Statement Transþrming student loan administration that went with the bill. 19. Given the extensive consultation and the positive feedback noted above, Officials consider that the extension of the pay-period assessment policy does not require further public consultation.20. We have undertaken further consultation with the Ministry of Education, the Treasury, and the Ministry of Social Development (including Studylink) in regards to the extension of the pay-period assessment policy. Their views have been incorporated into the paper and they are supportive of the extension of the pay-period assessment policy. CONCLUSION A¡{D RECOMMENDATION 21. As noted, the recommended option is to extend the pay-period assessment policy to the salary and wage earnings of all student loan borrowers. This would: remove a distinction between student loan borrowers that is now unnecessary as a result ofthe Budget 201 I announcements; and provide consistent treatment of all salary and wage earnings which would simplify the student loan scheme, improve equity and provide certainly to borrowers with salary and wage earnings. IMPLEMENTATION 22. These changes would be undertaken by Inland Revenue as part of the wider project to implement the changes under the Student Loan Scheme Bill. As these changes simplify the student loan scheme, implementing them would help to relieve pressure from Inland Revenue's efforts in this area. It would be easier to implement the preferred option than to retain the status quo. 23. Systems are being developed to support the bill that will ensure other income borrower's obligations are met. These systems will check that correct student loan deductions are made from salary and wage earnings. MONTTORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 24. In general, the monitoring, evaluation and review of these proposals would take place under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves a post-implementation review of legislation, and the identifrcation of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, this would mean that these proposals would be reviewed at a time after the policy has had some time to work. Any changes that are needed to give the legislation its intended effect would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP.
Regulatory Impact Statement Tax relief for depreciation clawback - Canterbury earthquake Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to provide tax relief for firms facing a depreciation recovery liability because of insurance proceeds on assets lost or destroyed as a consequence of the Canterbury earthquake and its aftershocks, including the 22 February event. The analysis has been undertaken in a very constrained timeframe, due to the urgency of the Government decisions that are required. This has limited the depth of research and analysis able to be undertaken. Where fiscal cost estimates have been made there is a significant degree of uncertainty involved due to difficulties in accurately estimating the quantum of depreciation recovery income. As a result of the urgency of the Government decisions that need to be made in relation in this problem, consultation has been limited. Further consultation, with the private sector is planned as this measure is finalised. None of the policy options would impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives for businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. The preferred option has the potential to increase compliance costs, but only for firms claiming rollover relief. This trade-off would be necessary for equity purposes. Dr Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 30 March 2011 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The policy problem is whether the current depreciation clawback rules produce the correct policy result for firms facing a depreciation recovery liability, due to receiving insurance proceeds on assets lost or destroyed as a consequence of the Canterbury earthquake and its aftershocks. 1 Many firms in Canterbury face serious destruction or loss of business assets. The consequent insurance payments may result in these firms facing a depreciation clawback liability. 2. When capital assets (buildings and plant and machinery) are purchased there is no income tax deduction for that expenditure. However, depreciation is deductible while the asset is available for business use. Depreciation is an estimate of the decline in value of an asset as it is used to earn income. When an asset is sold or destroyed the actual decline in value of the asset becomes clear. If the asset is sold for less than its depreciated tax value (book value) that loss is generally deductible since it demonstrates that depreciation was underestimated. If an asset is sold for more than its book value, then the depreciation deducted over the life of the asset was overestimated and the excess depreciation (the difference between the book value and the sales proceeds) is included as income. This is a clawing back of excess depreciation previously allowed and is known as "depreciation clawback" or "depreciation recovery". 3. If an asset is destroyed by an earthquake, the general rule is that the book value of the asset is a deductible loss. However, many income producing assets are insured. In these cases, assets are deemed to be sold for the value of the insurance proceeds. If the insurance proceeds exceed an item's book value, any excess depreciation is clawed back as income. 4. The depreciation rules for buildings and plant and equipment are similar, except that no deduction is allowed if a building is sold for less than its book value. However, if the building is destroyed, by a natural disaster, the loss is deductible to the extent that any insurance proceeds are less than its book value. Most buildings will be insured, often for more than their book value. Budget 2010 made the depreciation rate on most buildings zero. However, many will have had prior depreciation so that their book value will be lower than any insurance proceeds. In these cases, past depreciation will be fully or partially clawed back. 5. An example: In February 2011, a firm's building is destroyed in an earthquake. The building originally cost $3 million. The building would cost $6 million to replace. However, the book value is $2 million, reflecting prior depreciation of $1 million. The insurance proceeds are $6 million (the replacement cost). In the absence of any rollover relief, the building owner will have depreciation clawback of $1 million since instead of depreciating, the building has been going up in value. The insurance proceeds over and above the $3 million cost price are still a tax free capital gain. The difficulty is that the building owner has received insurance proceeds of $6 million to rebuild but at a 30 percent tax rate has a $0.3 million tax liability on the $1 million depreciation clawback. The building owner is left with $5.7 million to meet the reconstruction cost of $6 million. ' Insurance proceeds include an amount of insurance, indemnity or compensation received for the loss or destruction of a business asset. 2 6. A gap in our analysis is that we know very little about the value and nature of the assets destroyed, nor do we have a good understanding of whether these assets are insured. OBJECTIVES 7. The desired Government outcomes are to: • uphold the general direction of tax law while ensuring the current rules do not unnecessarily bring forward future tax liabilities, or produce results that may be seem as unfair and assist firms recovery from the Canterbury earthquake and it aftershocks, and assist rebuilding in the Canterbury region; • ensure that the revenue base remains sufficiently protected; and • provide certainty to those firms with potential depreciation clawback income liabilities as a result of the earthquake and its aftershocks. 8. The desired Government outcomes must be achieved within a short timeframe. This is because they are a response to a devastating event that has already occurred. Ideally, people should have certainty about what the tax treatment will be in respect of certain things they have done or are contemplating doing as soon as practically possible. This is certainly the case where the consequence is an exposure to income taxes. 9. Depreciation clawback is not a capital gains tax or a tax penalty but simply recognition that past depreciation deductions at the time of the event have been excessive. If it had been known in advance that the building owner would eventually receive insurance proceeds in excess of the the building's cost, then no depreciation should have been allowed. Therefore, depreciation clawback is generally the correct tax result. 10. However, in the context of the Canterbury earthquake there are grounds to support rollover relief as this may help achieve the Government's desired outcomes. These include: • There is likely to be substantial clawback of depreciation on destroyed buildings and some depreciation clawback for plant and equipment. This would hinder reconstruction in Canterbury since firms will have fewer funds to rebuild (assuming that they have already spent the tax value of the previous excess depreciation deductions). • Had the earthquake not happened, then buildings, plant and equipment may have been retained for a number of years in which case depreciation clawback may have been deferred into the future or indefinitely. • Depreciation clawback may also be seen as unfair, as taxpayers only face the prospect of depreciation clawback if depreciable assets have been totally destroyed, when lesser-affected firms will not face that tax liability until they ultimately sell the depreciable asset, perhaps in many years time. 3 REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 11. Several different options have been considered to address the problem and achieve the desired Government outcomes. 12. Option 1 addresses the concern that depreciation clawback may produce an incorrect policy result, given the Government's tax policy objective regarding the Canterbury earthquake and its aftershocks. Options 2 - 5 do not directly target this concern, but may meet some of the government's broader objectives. Option 1: Depreciation clawback rollover relief (officials preferred option) 13. The proposal is that depreciation clawback rollover relief should apply to allow the owner to rollover prior depreciation so that there is no immediate tax payable. This is often referred to as rollover relief. In the example above, the building destroyed is replaced by a new $6 million building. The $1 million of earlier depreciation is rolled over to the replacement building which although costing $6 million has an immediate book value of $5 million. If the building is subsequently sold for $6 million the $1 million excess depreciation would be clawed back as a tax liability for the vendor. 14. There are standard policy grounds for depreciation clawback. However, in the context of the Canterbury earthquake and its aftershocks there are strong grounds for providing rollover relief for depreciation clawback for destroyed buildings and destroyed or lost plant and equipment. Rollover relief on insurance proceeds invested in replacing assets lost or destroyed in the earthquake would have the following advantages: • it targets those firms with depreciation clawback liabilities; • depreciation clawback would be deferred until such time as the relevant asset is sold; • allowing insurance proceeds to be applied without imposing tax would assist firms affected by the Canterbury earthquake to recover; • it would address concerns about the depreciation clawback rules producing unfair results; and • it could also encourage rebuilding in Canterbury in a cost effective manner. 15. This option will increase compliance costs, which cannot be quantified because of poor data, for firms that apply rollover relief to newly acquired assets. The compliance costs arise because firms will need to separately track and account for assets where rollover relief has been taken. However, applying rollover relief is optional, so firms can make informed decisions on whether to access any rollover relief. 16. Fiscally, the government is forgoing a windfall gain (this was not an expected revenue stream). Further, with rollover relief being limited to insurance proceeds there are integrity advantages because insurance companies have incentives to check that each claim is legitimate. 17. Within the time available, it has not been possible to determine the social, environmental or cultural impacts of this option. 4 Option 2: No relief 18. The case for no relief was considered. As noted, depreciation clawback is not a capital gains tax or a tax penalty, but simply recognition that past depreciation deductions at the time of the event, have been excessive. In this instance, if it had been known before the earthquake that an earthquake was going to take place and that the building owner would receive insurance in excess of the building's cost, then no depreciation should have been allowed. Depreciation clawback in this case is the correct tax result. 19. However, in the context of the Canterbury earthquake and its aftershocks we believe that there are stronger policy grounds for providing rollover relief. Option 3: Provide expensing 20. Expensing means a firm is allowed an immediate deduction for the costs of a capital asset. Expensing would reduce the costs of building or purchasing replacement assets for those destroyed in the Canterbury earthquake and its aftershocks since the costs of rebuilding would give rise to immediate deductions. Expensing could also be targeted to encourage rebuilding in areas that have been particularly badly affected by the earthquake. 21. Expensing is not preferred because in order to target reconstruction it would require a range of design issues to be resolved, including defining qualifying assets, regional boundaries, and refundibility. In addition, expensing is costly. The initial estimate on allowing expensing for buildings was $800 million. Allowing expensing for other assets would increase this cost. Option 4: Reducing income taxes for firms in Canterbury 22. This option involves cutting the tax rate for firms located in Canterbury or specific locations within the Canterbury region. It was not preferred because reducing all tax rates in Canterbury would be fiscally expensive and it is not possible to effectively target tax cuts to those firms with depreciation clawback liabilities. 23. Lowering tax rates on firms located in Canterbury could encourage firms to locate into the region. However, this measure would not advantage the many firms operating in Canterbury in tax loss. Moreover, cutting the company tax rate would give rise to a set of complex issues. Given our imputation system, company tax for New Zealand taxpaying shareholders is only a withholding tax until tax payments are made to top up this amount to the shareholder's marginal rate when dividends are paid. This makes cuts in the company tax rate relatively ineffective as a way of aiding reconstruction. 24. If company tax rates were reduced in Canterbury there would also be incentives for corporate groups to use interest, royalty or service fee payments to allocate income to Canterbury operations even if the actual economic activity was performed in other parts of New Zealand. Businesses also operate through trusts, partnerships or as sole-traders and in these cases trustee and personal tax rates generally apply. Our tax rules do not differentiate between business income and other income (such as employment or investment income). 5 Option 5: Allowing losses to be carried back 25. Allowing businesses to carry back losses so that they could be used to reduce tax on income earned in previous years could help some businesses deal with cash-flow issues which may allow them to rebuild or recover more quickly. Loss carry-back would effectively cash out losses to the extent that businesses were in profit in the years prior to the earthquake. 26. Loss carry-back would be ineffecti ve for businesses that were already in loss due to the general economic downturn. Another drawback of loss carry-back is that it would cancel imputation credits earned in previous years. This means that for businesses that have already paid out their prior year income as imputed dividends, there would be no benefit, as the amount of tax that could be refunded would be limited by the amount of credits that had not been distributed to shareholders. Finally, there would be complexities in working out how businesses would apportion losses in cases where they operate not only in Canterbury but also in other areas. It is clear that loss carry-back would be much less closely associated with reconstruction than expensing or partial expensing. 27. For these reasons loss carry-back was not the preferred option. CONSULTATION 28. The urgency of the Government decisions that need to be made in relation to this problem has meant that consultation has been limited. Consideration has been given to correspondence received by Ministers and officials in connection with the issue. Consultation has been undertaken with the Treasury. 29. However, there will be a period for feedback after the announcement and we propose to consult on the draft legislation with a number of organisations that are involved in tax policy development, including the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and the New Zealand Law Society. This provides an opportunity for the rollover relief proposal to be tested and modified as appropriate. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 30. Officials have considered the options outlined above. Officials consider that rollover relief (option 1 above) is appropriate and best addresses the problem in a way that meets the desired Government outcomes. This solution limits the potential cost and risks associated with providing tax relief. It provides more appropriate tax results, given the magnitude of the Canterbury earthquake, whilst providing the necessary degree of protection to the revenue base. 31. Further, it has been agreed by Ministers that, for equity reasons, these options would also apply to the 4 September 2010 Canterbury earthquake. 6 IMPLEMENTATION 32. Amendments to the Income Tax Act would be needed to give effect to rollover relief. The amendments could apply to firms with lost or destroyed assets because of the Canterbury earthquake and its aftershocks, provided the insurance proceeds exceed the book value of the relevant assets, and the firm reinvests. There are a range of legislative vehicles to give effect to the necessary amendments. 33. Any new rules will be administered by Inland Revenue through existing channels. Overall compliance costs are reduced by making rollover relief optional. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 34. Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTPP") to confirm they meet the policy objectives. 35. The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified following the proposed amendments would be added to the tax policy work programme. New proposal would go through the normal GTPP. 7
Regulatory Impact Statement Relief of interest on overdue tax (foreign workers here for the earthquakes) Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to relieve interest on overdue tax for foreign workers in New Zealand following the earthquakes in Canterbury (including aftershocks). Some of these workers have not paid tax in New Zealand because they expected their stay to be too short for a tax liability to arise. Further earthquakes have lengthened their stays, however, so that they have become liable for tax. That tax is now overdue. Two feasible options have been identified. The first is to relieve interest on overdue tax in the circumstances. The second is the status quo. A third option, complete relief from tax for the foreign workers, is not considered on the grounds that its benefits are questionable, its costs are high and it has already been considered twice before. The analysis in this statement has been limited by the short time available (the issue requires an urgent response) and by incomplete data. It has not been possible to quantify some costs and benefits, owing to the nature of those costs and benefits or to a scarcity of data. There has been previous consultation with the industry about the general issue of taxation of foreign workers coming to New Zealand following the earthquakes. However, there has not been time for consultation about the specific proposal to relieve interest on overdue tax. If relief from interest is provided, a legislative amendment will be required and there will be consultation with industry about the detail of that amendment. The option to relieve interest is not expected to: • impose additional costs on businesses (reduced tax would exceed any increased compliance costs) • impair private property rights, restrict market competition, or reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest, or • override fundamental common law principles. Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 6 July 2011 l STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. Foreign loss adjusters (insurance assessors) have come to New Zealand to assist with insurance assessments in the wake of earthquakes in Canterbury (including aftershocks). If they remain in New Zealand for a sufficient time (often 183 days) the loss adjusters are liable to pay New Zealand tax. This is the case for their employees as well, if they have any. 2. Many loss adjusters organised their affairs to avoid long stays here, so that they would not have to pay tax in New Zealand. On that basis, they have not paid any tax so far. However, stays have been unexpectedly prolonged because of the significant earthquakes in February and June. 3. Loss adjusters who had not paid any tax, on the expectation of a short stay, may now find themselves liable. The liability extends back to their arrival, and the tax is now overdue. This has prompted concerns about interest charged on the unpaid tax and penalties for late payment. We understand from recent correspondence with a Minister's office that these concerns are making it difficult to keep some of the loss adjusters in New Zealand. 4. Inland Revenue has discretion to waive penalties for late payment. However, Inland Revenue currently has no explicit ability to waive interest charged on overdue tax owed by the loss adjusters. 5. This RIS identifies options for addressing concerns about the interest on overdue tax. OBJECTIVES 6. The government does not wish to impose financial penalties on workers who have come to New Zealand to assist in the aftermath of the earthquakes, if those workers have acted in good faith. 7. The government also does not wish financial penalties to become an undue barrier to retaining foreign workers in New Zealand. 8. At the same time, the government does not wish to incur a high fiscal cost. 9. The analysis in this statement has been triggered by communication from loss adjusting firms that employ foreign contractors. They have expressed a need to make a decision with urgency, given that some loss adjusters are on the cusp of leaving the country to prevent tax liabilities arising. This limits the time available to consider alternative solutions. However, it is noted that related issues of taxation of foreign loss adjusters have been raised, and considered, on two previous occasions. The prior consideration informs this statement. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 10. Two practical options have been identified. These are: • First option: through legislative change, relieve interest on unpaid tax for foreign workers who have come to New Zealand because of the earthquakes and might have had their stays prolonged by further earthquakes. 2 • Second option: status quo. 11. Another option - exempting foreign workers from tax altogether - is not considered a feasible option. This option was considered and rejected by the Ministers of Finance and Revenue on two previous occasions, following reports by Treasury and Inland Revenue. The option was rejected on two grounds. The first ground is that tax relief in New Zealand would usually result in additional tax abroad, generally of a matching amount. As such, there would be little advantage for the workers. The second ground is that the fiscal cost for New Zealand could be high. First option: relieve interest on unpaid tax 12. The case that is causing concern involves people coming to New Zealand expecting a short stay. Because of the intended short stay they have not paid tax. However, they have ended up staying for longer and become liable to tax. The tax liability extends back to the start of their stay. Interest is chargeable on the unpaid tax and this cannot be relieved in most circumstances. 13. The first option would amend legislation to allow for relief of interest on unpaid tax. 14. It is assumed that the relief would apply to any foreign contractor or employee present in New Zealand as a result of the earthquakes. It would not be limited to loss adjusters because there is nothing that identifies loss adjusters as more deserving than any other occupation. 15. It is also assumed that the relief would extend to tax liabilities arising in the first year following the first earthquake. The first year is a proxy for the period during which stays could have been unexpectedly lengthened by the major earthquakes in February and July. It is not desirable to provide relief for people who come later, who can reasonably estimate their length of stay at the outset. If there are further major earthquakes, this assumption may require revision. 16. Finally, it is assumed that interest will begin to accrue again, from a base of nil, once it is clear that the person has become liable to tax (usually 183 days for contractors). There is no desire to allow people to continue to ignore their tax obligations once it is clear that they have them. 17. The first option meets the government's objective (see Objectives above) to be fair to foreign workers here to assist following the earthquakes, and contributes to the objective that financial penalties should not be an undue barrier to attracting and retaining such workers. Relieving interest, in combination with discretionary relief that is already able to be given for other penalties, will remove an impediment to retaining specialist staff in New Zealand. However, this is not a quantifiable benefit. 18. The first option also meets the government's objective not to incur high fiscal cost. It is estimated that relief of interest on loss adjusters would cost the government $170,000. This is based on an estimate of 400 loss adjusters earning $160,000 per annum. This estimate is likely to be biased upwards (for example, not all the loss adjusters will be here for long stays). Doubling the estimate to take into account other specialists such as engineers increases the cost to $350,000. The ability to produce an accurate cost estimate is limited by incomplete data, but even if the assumptions are varied significantly the cost should not exceed $ 1 million. 3 19. Interest relief, in principle, should reduce the amount paid by foreign workers to the New Zealand government. However in some cases, contracts may have specified that tax would be paid by the person hiring the foreign worker, in which case the relief would reduce the amount paid by the hirer to the government. In that case, there would be a windfall gain for the hirer with little effect on the incentive for foreign workers to come to or remain in the country. 20. The first option imposes a new compliance cost. In order to relieve the interest, Inland Revenue will need to know that the person is eligible for relief. This will require, at least in the default case, an application to be made by the taxpayer (see Implementation below for ways in which this will be dealt with). 21. Administrative costs are expected to be minimal and would be met within existing resources. Second option: status quo 22. The status quo would not meet the government's objectives for fairness to earthquake- related workers and may be inconsistent with the desire to remove undue impediments to retaining such workers. 23. At least some foreign workers who came here for the earthquakes paid no tax because they did not expect to be here long enough to incur any liability. Following further large earthquakes, their services were required for a longer period and they became liable to tax from the first day of their stay. If they had have been aware that they would be here for so long, they would have paid tax from the outset and avoided interest charges. It seems unfair to impose tax on these people, given that the further earthquakes are extremely unusual events that it would have been impractical to anticipate. 24. To avoid interest charges, foreign workers may decide to leave the country before their stay exceeds the relevant time limit. This could put pressure on the supply of workers to assist with the recovery from the earthquakes. This effect is not quantifiable. The effect may be reduced to the extent to which firms are earning high margins for earthquake-related work and so can afford to pay foreign workers more to compensate for any penalties they incur. 25. The status quo would meet the objective of having low fiscal cost. Its direct cost would be nil. CONSULTATION 26. The Treasury has been consulted about the proposal to relieve interest on unpaid tax. There has been no consultation with industry about the specific proposal to relieve use of money interest because of the short time frame for making decisions. However, it is anticipated that the detailed design of a legislative amendment would involve contributions from industry. 27. There has been consultation, following the first earthquake and again after the February earthquake, with loss adjusting firms and large accounting firms about the general issue of taxation of loss adjusters. These firms have requested a general tax exemption, which officials have opposed (on the grounds outlined above). 4 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 28. Foreign workers in New Zealand because of the Canterbury earthquakes may become subject to New Zealand tax if they are here for long enough, and may be liable for interest charges once the tax liability arises. This may make it difficult to retain foreign workers. 29. Two options have been considered for responding to the problem, with the first being preferred. 30. The first option is to relieve interest on unpaid tax when foreign workers are in New Zealand within a year of the first earthquake, by a change to legislation. This would remove an impediment to retaining foreign workers in earthquake-related occupations, and can be seen to be fairer than the status quo. This benefit is difficult to quantify. 31. The fiscal cost of the preferred option is estimated, with considerable uncertainty, to be $350,000. It is unlikely to be more than $1 million. A small additional compliance cost, to apply for the interest relief, would be introduced. 32. The second option is to maintain the status quo. This may lead to some foreign workers leaving New Zealand prematurely to avoid interest charges arising and could be seen as unfair. It would not have any direct fiscal cost. IMPLEMENTATION 33. The first option would require a legislative change. It is intended that the detail of the change would be finalised in consultation with industry, to reduce the chance of unintended omissions. 34. At an operational level, Inland Revenue can already use its computer systems to remit interest charges. This is a manual process but is straightforward and not time consuming, particularly given the relatively small number of people who are likely to be claiming relief. 35. In some cases in which the identity of affected taxpayers is known, it might be possible to put manual blocks on accounts so that interest will be manually remitted before any demands are sent to taxpayers. However, this is a manually intensive process. 36. In general, however, it is not possible to identify all the people who would be eligible for relief. 37. Interest would therefore be charged by default, and the taxpayer would need to apply for the relief. To reduce compliance costs as much as possible, Inland Revenue would communicate to tax agents, particularly those known to be dealing with foreign workers here after the earthquakes, to advise them that relief is available and to tell them how to apply. The Inland Revenue team that is the main point of contact for non-resident contractors would also be able to advise taxpayers of the relief in the general course of its work. 38. The alternative option of the status quo would not require any implementation. Existing legislation and processes would be employed. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 39. The cost of the first option (interest relief) is relatively small, and the option applies only for a short period (approximately a year). 5 40. At the same time, the benefits of the option are difficult to quantify. A foreign worker will take many factors into account when deciding whether to come to or remain in New Zealand, and tax is just one of those. It would be very difficult to distinguish cases in which a person stays because of interest relief from cases in which a person would have stayed anyway. People might also leave for a variety of reasons, including dislike of ongoing aftershocks. 41. Because of the relatively low fiscal cost, the temporary nature of the option, and the difficulty of assessing benefits, we do not propose any explicit monitoring or post- implementation review process for the first option. 42. Inland Revenue and Treasury officials will, however, continue to make themselves available for discussion with industry should any further difficulties arise. 6
1 1 September 2011 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Foreign Investment PIEs This special report provides early information on the new Foreign Investment Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) rules, which were part of the recently enacted Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011 (the Act). It precedes coverage of the new legislation that will appear in a Tax Information Bulletin to be published later in the year. In summary, the Act introduces two new categories of PIE: “foreign investment zero- rate PIEs” and “foreign investment variable-rate PIEs”. For the sake of brevity, these will be referred to as “zero-rate PIEs” and “variable-rate PIEs” in the rest of this document. PIEs and entities becoming a PIE will be able to become a zero-rate PIE from 29 August 2011 (the date the Act received Royal Assent) and a variable-rate PIE from 1 April 2012. The rules for foreign investment PIEs aim to align the tax treatment of non-resident investors in PIEs with the tax treatment of direct investors. Resident investors in a foreign investment PIE will continue to be taxed as if they were in an ordinary PIE. This report is intended to provide timely assistance to entities (whether currently a PIE or not) that are considering electing to be a foreign investment PIE. Further guidance on the new foreign investment PIE rules will be available over the coming months on Inland Revenue’s website and in a Tax Information Bulletin. Background When the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules were originally developed in 2007, the focus was ensuring that the rules operated properly for resident investors in KiwiSaver funds. The rules were designed so the tax treatment of a resident investor in a PIE roughly matched that of direct investment into the PIE’s underlying assets. This required reasonably complex rules in a number of areas. Given the complexity of the new rules and the systems changes for managed funds it was not practical at that time to also provide non-resident investors in a PIE a tax treatment similar to that of direct investors. Non-resident investors are currently taxed at a flat 28 percent on their PIE income, regardless of the income’s source and type. In many instances this rate is much higher than that which would apply had the investor invested directly into the PIE’s underlying assets. For example, a non-resident investing in a foreign company would not be subject to New Zealand tax. This is because of the general principle underlying the tax system that non-residents should only be subject to tax on their New Zealand-sourced 2 income. Despite this, such an investment through an ordinary PIE would be taxed at 28 percent. The PIE rules have had time to bed-down and the relevant legislation is now relatively settled. At the same time, various reports (most recently, the report of the International Funds Services Development Group) noted there is the potential for New Zealand to become a “financial hub” – providing back-office services to international managed funds. To take advantage of such an opportunity, the over-taxation of non-resident investors in PIEs would need to be resolved. This is the objective of the new foreign investment PIE rules. Key features • The Act introduces two new categories of PIE: “foreign investment zero-rate PIE” (referred to as “zero-rate PIEs”) and “foreign investment variable-rate PIE” (referred to as “variable-rate PIEs”). The rules for these PIEs aim to align the tax treatment of non-resident investors in the PIE with the tax treatment of direct non-resident investors. Resident investors in a foreign investment PIE will continue to be taxed as if they were in an ordinary PIE. • The new rules are optional. PIEs do not need to elect to become one of the new types of PIE and can continue to apply the existing rules, where PIEs are taxed at 28 percent on the income attributable to non-residents. • Zero-rate PIEs are generally only able to invest offshore. De minimis levels of New Zealand-sourced income are allowed, however. This allows such a PIE to finance its day-to-day operations with a New Zealand bank account, for example. • Zero-rate PIEs are taxed at zero percent on all PIE income attributable to certain non-residents. • Variable-rate PIEs can invest into both New Zealand and offshore assets. • Variable-rate PIEs face a variety of different tax rates on income attributable to non- residents, depending on the type and source of the income. Application dates The rules for zero-rate PIEs will apply from the date of Royal Assent of the Act 29 August 2011. The rules for variable-rate PIEs will apply from 1 April 2012. 3 Detailed analysis Introductory provisions Sections HM 2, HM 6 and YA 1 Section HM 2 has been amended to include the two types of foreign investment PIE in the list of PIE types. Additionally, section HM 6 has been amended to set out the intended effects for investors in foreign investment PIEs - namely: • that for a “notified foreign investor” in a foreign investment PIE, the PIE has a tax liability that resembles that of the investor if they were to make the investment directly; and, • a notified foreign investor should have no tax liability on their PIE income unless they have been treated as a notified foreign investor when they do not in fact meet the relevant requirements. A “notified foreign investor” is essentially a non-resident who has elected for the new rules to apply to them and has supplied the required information to the PIE. This concept is described more fully below. Definitions have been inserted in section YA 1 for “foreign investment PIE”, “foreign investment variable-rate PIE”, “foreign investment zero-rate PIE” and “notified foreign investor”. Notified foreign investors Sections CX 56, HM 55D and YA 1 The new tax treatment of investors in a foreign investment PIE applies to those who elect to become a “notified foreign investor”. The relevant criteria for this election are set out in section HM 55D. The general rule is that a notified foreign investor must be a non-resident. Specifically, a person cannot be: (i) resident in New Zealand; (ii) a controlled foreign company; (iii) a non-portfolio foreign investment fund; or, (iv) a non-resident trustee of a trust other than a foreign trust. To target what is a non-portfolio foreign investment fund (FIF), the legislated restriction is that the item “income interest” in section EX 50(4) cannot be 10% or more for an investor. In effect, this means that if a FIF has a New Zealand-resident investor entitled to 10% or more of its income, either directly or indirectly, that FIF cannot elect to be a notified foreign investor. 4 Non-resident trustees of trusts other than foreign trusts cannot be a notified foreign investor. Such trustees are not taxed in the same way as other non-residents, so it is not appropriate for them to be treated as notified foreign investors. Similarly, resident trustees of foreign trusts are not able to be notified foreign investors as such trustees are taxed as New Zealand residents on any New Zealand-sourced trustee income. In addition to a person not being one of the types described above, in order to be treated as a notified foreign investor, a person must also provide the PIE with the information set out in section 28D(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Examples of required information are the person’s name, address, country, and their tax file number in their home country (if applicable). If an investor in a foreign investment PIE meets these requirements, the investor can notify the foreign investment PIE that they wish to be treated as a notified foreign investor. If the person meets the relevant criteria, they then become a notified foreign investor. Special rules apply when a person transitions to or from being a notified foreign investor as set out in section HM 55E. See “Change in status of investors” on pg 14 for more detail. PIE relying on notification Investors must self-assess that they are a person who can be a notified foreign investor. Accordingly, a foreign investment PIE can rely on an investor’s notification that they should be treated as a notified foreign investor. The investor must provide the PIE with the information set out in section 28D(1) of the Tax Administration Act. If the investor does not, the PIE is unable to treat the investor as a notified foreign investor. Ineligible investor treated as a notified foreign investor If an investor has been treated as a notified foreign investor when they do not in fact meet the relevant requirements, the investor will generally be treated in the same way as a resident investor who notifies a PIE of a tax rate that is too low. That is, section CX 56 will not apply to the PIE income attributed to them, so the income will not be excluded. If this is the case the investor should include the attributed PIE income in their tax return and is able to claim a tax credit for any tax paid by the PIE on their behalf. An exception to this general rule is if one of the transitional rules in section HM 55E apply. These are described in more detail on pg 14. Commissioner can override notification Although a PIE is able to rely on an investor’s notification that they are eligible to be a notified foreign investor, section HM 55D(6) provides that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is able to advise the PIE to disregard the investor’s notification and treat them as an ordinary non-resident investing in a PIE, taxed at 28%. This notification must be on reasonable grounds. 5 Calculation of income and tax liability for notified foreign investors Sections DB 54B, HM 35C, HM 47, HM 55F, HM 64, HM 65 and schedule 6 Foreign investment PIEs have special rules for calculating PIE income attributed to notified foreign investors and the associated tax liability. Calculating income The aim of the foreign investment PIE regime is to tax PIE income attributed to non- resident investors in a similar manner to a direct non-resident investor. To reflect this, expenses incurred in relation to notified foreign investors are non-deductible. This is provided by section DB 54B. Further, the calculation formulae in sections HM 35 to 47 are modified so any expenses cannot be subtracted from the income of a notified foreign investor. Carry-forward losses and land losses are similarly set to zero. It should be noted, however, that streaming is not allowed. Expenses and losses must still be attributed to notified foreign investors even though they cannot be utilised by them. Section HM 35C(2) provides that, for the purpose of the calculations in sections HM 35 to 47, for each investor class, a foreign investment PIE must treat the notified foreign investors of that class as if they were in a separate notional investor class. The purpose of this rule is to split each investor class in two – one part containing investors to whom the normal PIE rules apply and one part containing notified foreign investors. Importantly, it is not intended that a foreign investment PIE be forced to create a notional investor class for its notified foreign investors if there is a better way for the PIE to create the same result. 6 Correction of errors PIEs, on occasion, erroneously attribute an amount of income to an investor. In some cases it is not possible to directly undo this error, for example due to the passage of time. In such cases a PIE will often attribute an investor, in the current period, an offsetting negative amount of income, which effectively undoes the earlier error. It is not intended for such an adjustment to be affected by section HM 35C, which modifies section HM 35 so expenses cannot be subtracted from a notified foreign investor’s income. Such adjustments are considered to be accounting entries designed to correct earlier errors, so do not form part of the legislated formulae. Calculation of tax liability Section HM 47 is amended to establish how a notified foreign investor’s tax liability should be calculated. Subsection (2B) clarifies that, for a notified foreign investor, the calculation in subsection (3) must be done for each investment type and source. This requirement is only relevant for variable-rate PIEs, for which different tax rates apply for different investment types and sources. Linking in with this is section HM 55F(2), which requires a variable-rate PIE to identify the source and type (if it is not a foreign-sourced amount) of all amounts attributed to notified foreign investors. The different tax rates for income of differing types and sources are set out in schedule 6, table 1B. The requirement to perform the calculation in subsection (3) for each investment type and source does not apply to a Example In the current calculation period, ABC, a PIE, has derived $1000 in assessable income and incurred $100 of expenses deriving that income. In addition, ABC has $200 of formation losses that it can use in the period. ABC has 2 investors, Rachael and Grant, who are each entitled to 50% of its distributions (for simplicity, assume that ABC does not need to meet the investor in requirements of the PIE rules). Rachael is a notified foreign investor and Grant is a resident investor with a 28% prescribed investor rate. ABC must attribute Rachael’s share of its expenses and formation losses; however, it cannot use these to reduce Rachael’s net income. Her attributed PIE income is therefore equivalent to her share of the PIE’s assessable income - $500. As Grant is an ordinary resident investor he is able to benefit from ABC’s expenses and formation losses. Grant will have attributed PIE income of $350, which is his share of ABC’s income less his share of the expenses and formation losses. The $50 of expenses and $100 of formation losses that ABC was not able to utilise (as they were attributed a notified foreign investor) are exhausted. They cannot be used in a later period. 7 zero-rate PIE, as all its income attributed to a notified foreign investor is taxed at the same rate (0%). There is no change in the tax liability calculation for investors other than for notified foreign investors in either type of foreign investment PIE. Finally, if a notified foreign investor’s tax liability is negative, new section HM 55F(6) provides that no tax credit arises. Optional flow-through rule Section HM 6B PIEs often use a tiered investment structure, where retail PIEs invest through larger wholesale PIEs. New section HM 6B provides an optional flow-through rule to ensure this structure is compatible with foreign investment PIEs. Full flow-through Sections HM 6B(1) and (2) provide a rule ultimately designed to be used by variable- rate PIEs, however, the rule can be used by any type of PIE. The flow-through rule allows a PIE (PIE A) to be treated as if it has derived another PIE’s (PIE B’s) income directly. If PIE A applies the flow-through rule, income from PIE B would not be “attributed PIE income” but would retain its character. This includes notional income, such as income under the fair dividend rate (FDR) regime, which is not paid to B but is deemed to be derived by it nonetheless. The intention is that expenses charged to A by B will also be treated as incurred by A. This should be the case regardless of whether the charge is explicit (i.e. an invoice sent to A) or implicit (i.e. B takes out its charges from what it attributes to A). Nevertheless, these expenses will not be deductible if they are attributed to notified foreign investors or if there is no nexus with assessable income (for example, they were incurred in deriving untaxed amounts). The flow-through rule is designed to look through multiple levels of PIE. For example, say PIE A invested into PIE B, which in turn invested into PIE C. B could use the flow-through rule for the income it derives from C, and in turn A could use the flow- through rule for the income it derives from B. In effect, A will be treated as if it has derived its share of C’s income directly. Applying the optional flow-through rule requires information about the gross receipts from each investment source and type to flow between PIEs each attribution period. The rule cannot be used unless this information is available. As such, if the information is not available, any attributed PIE income should be treated as such, and accordingly will have a New Zealand source. 8 Variable-rate PIE treating amounts as foreign-sourced Section HM 6B(3) provides a flow-through rule that allows it to treat income derived from a zero-rate PIE (or a PIE eligible to become a zero-rate PIE) as a foreign-sourced amount. This is on the basis that the ultimate investments will generally be offshore. A similar rule operates for zero-rate PIEs, allowing such PIEs to derive income from a zero-rate PIE (or a PIE eligible to become a zero-rate PIE) although, on its face, the income will be New Zealand sourced. This is described in the section “Allowable amounts”. Modified residence rules Sections HM 8(2) and HM 19B(2) Section HM 19B(2) is designed to clarify that a zero-rate PIE will be treated as resident in New Zealand provided it is a unit trust to which the Unit Trust Act applies and has a New Zealand resident trustee. The clarification is necessary because unit trusts are not incorporated, so country of incorporation cannot be used to determine residence. No such clarification is necessary for PIEs that are companies, as place of incorporation is available to determine residence for companies. The section is not intended to restrict the types of entity eligible to become a zero-rate PIE. Example R is a retail PIE that invests solely into W, a wholesale PIE. R holds 20% of the units in W, so is entitled to 20% of W’s income. R is a variable-rate PIE while W is an ordinary PIE. In the latest calculation period, W has derived the following amounts of New Zealand-sourced income: $1000 interest income; $2000 fully imputed dividends; $5000 from a foreign currency hedge. W has also derived $10000 in foreign-sourced amounts. R is able to get this information from W, which is sufficient information to apply the flow-through rule, and chooses to apply the flow-through. Accordingly, R is treated as deriving its share of W’s income. Specifically: $200 New Zealand-sourced interest income; $400 New Zealand-sourced fully imputed dividends; $1000 New Zealand-sourced non-interest financial arrangement income; and $2000 foreign-sourced income. 9 Investment types and sources Sections HM 11, HM 12, HM 19B(1) and HM 19C Sections HM 19B(1) and HM 19C set out the rules for the investment types and sources that zero-rate PIEs and variable-rate PIEs, respectively, are able to derive. A zero-rate is only able to derive a foreign sourced amount or an allowable amount (a concept defined by section HM 55G). It is intended that the measurement of whether or not a zero-rate PIE’s New Zealand- sourced income falls within the criteria of allowable amounts should only be done quarterly (as per section HM 55H). If a zero-rate PIE inadvertently breaches one of the allowable amount thresholds, the PIE will generally have a quarter to remedy the breach. That said, it is not intended that this rule should be used by a PIE to intentionally derive New Zealand sourced income in between the quarterly tests. A variable-rate PIE is able to derive both foreign sourced amounts and New Zealand sourced amounts. However, variable-rate PIEs are not able to invest in New Zealand land (or rights or options in relation to land), nor are they able to derive income from New Zealand land. Non-residents can generally deduct expenses incurred in deriving income from land, so allowing such investment would greatly complicate the foreign investment PIE rules. Both variable-rate and zero-rate PIEs are able to invest in land not situated in New Zealand. Variable-rate PIEs can also invest in New Zealand companies that own land, although there are limits on the percentage of ownership the PIE can have. As with zero-rate PIEs, variable-rate PIEs are also generally given a “grace period”, designed to allow corrections of any inadvertent breaches of these rules. Modified investment-out test Section HM 13 PIEs are generally only able to hold up to 20% of the voting rights in ordinary companies (or, for unit trusts, 20% of the interests in that trust). This restriction is extended for foreign investment PIEs so that it also applies to land investment companies and entities that qualify for PIE status. In effect, foreign investment PIEs can only exceed the 20% limit on investments in other PIEs (including foreign investment PIEs) and foreign PIE equivalents. The reason for this broad 20% ownership restriction is to ensure the non-deductibility of expenses attributed to notified foreign investors. Allowing a foreign investment PIE to have controlling interests in subsidiary companies could provide opportunities for that PIE to shift non-deductible expenses to its subsidiary entities, where the expenses may be deductible. The same concern does not arise with controlling interests in subsidiary PIEs due to the operation of the flow-through rule. Thus, the ownership restriction does not apply to such investments. 10 Rules for the treatment of investors Section HM 32(3) Section HM 32(3) provides that, if a person notifies a PIE that they wish to be treated as a notified foreign investor, that person is treated as having notified the PIE of a tax rate for the purposes of section HM 32(1). The default rate therefore does not apply for the person. Foreign investment PIEs and PIE proxies Section HM 33 The rules for PIE proxies have been modified to cater for foreign investment PIEs. If a PIE proxy chooses to provide the benefits to its non-resident investors of the foreign investment PIE rules, it must: • act as a proxy for a foreign investment PIE; • if acting for a variable-rate PIE, obtain that PIE’s income details in order to apply the appropriate tax rates to each type and source of income; and, • collect any information from the investor required by the PIE (such as the investor’s country of residence, which is required under section HM 55D(4)). These new provisions only apply to proxies that choose to act for foreign investment PIEs. There is no change in the treatment of proxies that act only for ordinary PIEs. No provisional tax option for foreign investment PIEs Sections HM 41(3) and HM 44 Foreign investment PIEs are unable to use the provisional tax option for calculating their tax liability. The rationale for this restriction was that, given the nature of PIEs that pay provisional tax, it was considered they would be unable to comply with the new rules. Ability to withhold NRWT Sections HM 44 and, CX 56B Instead of paying tax on behalf of a notified foreign investor, a foreign investment PIE has the option of withholding non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on distributions of unimputed dividends paid out to the investor. If the PIE received partially imputed dividends from a New Zealand company, it would be able to use this option to the extent the dividends were unimputed. For example, if it received a $100 dividend with $20 of imputation credits attached, and the PIE distributed the full $100, it could withhold NRWT on $48.57 of the distribution. As NRWT is a withholding tax, this option can only be applied to amounts actually distributed. Note that, due to the fungibility of money, it is only required that the PIE distribute an amount equivalent to what it has in unimputed dividends. This 11 distribution must be made on or before the date the PIE would otherwise be required to pay PIE tax on the amount. For example, if the PIE were an “exit PIE” (i.e. pays tax under section HM 42), it would generally have until 30 April after the end of the tax year to make a distribution and withhold NRWT. However, if a notified foreign investor reached an exit period, the PIE would generally need to make the distribution one month after the end of the month in which the exit period fell in order to be able to apply this NRWT option. If a PIE elects to withhold NRWT on an amount on behalf of a notified foreign investor, that amount is not included in the investor’s assessable income in section HM 35(3) or their income in section HM 36(3). As such, it does not constitute income that the PIE must pay tax on, nor is it included in the investor’s attributed PIE income. Further, section CX 56, which normally deems distributions from a PIE to be excluded, does not apply. In all, this is to clarify that the NRWT is a tax borne by the investor, not the PIE. Finally, section CX 56B does not apply to the extent a distribution has had NRWT withheld on it. This means the income is not excluded income of the investor. If the amount distributed exceeds the amount that has been subject to NRWT, the balance continues to be excluded. 12 Use of tax credits by foreign investment PIEs Sections LS 1, HM 51 and HM 53 The intention of the new rules is that notified foreign investors in foreign investment PIEs are unable to utilise foreign tax credits and imputation credits attributed to them. Other credits can be utilised by notified foreign investors, but we do not expect this to be a common occurrence. PIEs generally hold RWT exemption certificates so it would be unusual for a notified foreign investor to be attributed an RWT credit in relation to interest earned. Nevertheless, if this were to happen, the PIE would be able to utilise this credit on the investor’s behalf. In turn, the investor would be taxed at the rate generally charged on interest paid to non-residents. Overall, the treatment should match that afforded to a non-resident investing directly. Example Z has elected to become a variable-rate foreign investment PIE. Z has derived $400 in income, constituting of: $200 New Zealand-sourced partially imputed dividends ($200 cash dividend with $40 of imputation credits attached) $200 foreign-sourced amounts. Z has decided it will distribute all of this income to its investors. Z has two investors: Sarah, who has elected to be a notified foreign investor, and Frank, who is a resident investor with a 28% prescribed investor rate (for simplicity, assume that Z does not need to meet the investor in requirements of the PIE rules). Each investor holds 50% of the units in Z. Since Sarah is a notified foreign investor, Z has decided withhold NRWT on the payment to her. Sarah’s share of Z’s dividends is $100 and $20 of imputation credits, which is equivalent to $51.43 in fully imputed dividends and $48.57 in unimputed dividends. Z therefore withholds NRWT on $48.57 of its distribution, which is $7.29 (assuming the applicable NRWT rate is 15%). The income that Z has withheld NRWT on ceases to be attributed PIE income of Sarah’s – her attributed PIE income is now $151.43. Z must pay tax on this amount as usual; however, since it only consists of fully imputed dividends and foreign- sourced amounts, the applicable tax rate is 0%. Net-of-tax Sarah receives $192.71. As Frank is a resident investor, Z must pay tax on income attributed to him as per normal. Frank’s share of Z’s income is $200 (plus $20 of imputation credits) and Z must pay tax on this. Net-of-tax and after accounting for the imputation credits, Frank receives $158.40. 13 It is important to note that a foreign investment PIE cannot stream its tax credits. It must still attribute its credits amongst investors as stipulated by section HM 50, despite the fact that credits attributed to notified foreign investors will generally not be able to be used. Modified source rules Section HM 55C For foreign investment PIEs, certain source rules are overridden in some situations. Income attributed to a notified foreign investor is not deemed to have a New Zealand source merely because: • a foreign investment PIE carries on a business in New Zealand; or, • the income is derived from a contract made or performed in New Zealand, provided the income from the contract relates to the PIE’s offshore investments. The restriction that a contract’s income must relate to the PIE’s offshore investment is designed to cover arrangements such as foreign currency hedges or derivatives to increase or decrease exposure to foreign share markets – even if that contract is entered into with a New Zealand counterparty. The restriction was put in place as otherwise the rule could be too far-reaching. Some contracts may only be given a New Zealand source by the operation of section YD 4(3) (contracts made or performed in New Zealand). Overriding it without qualification would therefore be risky. Importantly, if there is some other reason for an amount to have a New Zealand source, the income will continue to be treated as having a New Zealand source under section YD 4(18). Zero percent rate for transitional residents Sections CX 56, HM 55D(8) and schedule 6, table 1 Transitional residents are generally not taxed on their non-New Zealand sourced investment income. Accordingly, transitional residents are able to invest in zero-rate PIEs and be taxed at a 0% tax rate. Similar rules that apply to notified foreign investors are intended to also apply to such transitional residents – for example, fees and expenses should not be deductible to such investors and credits should not be able to be utilised by them. Similar transitional rules to those that apply to notified foreign investors who become or cease to be non-residents in a tax year also apply. It should be noted that transitional residents cannot be notified foreign investors; they are only able to elect a 0% tax rate in zero-rate PIEs. This is on the basis that, while transitional residents are generally not taxed on their foreign-sourced investment income, they are taxed as a New Zealand resident on any New Zealand-sourced income. Allowing transitional residents to elect to be a notified foreign investor would therefore be inappropriate. 14 Change in status of investors in foreign investment PIEs Sections CX 56 and HM 55E Transitional rules can apply when a person changes to or from being a notified foreign investor. These rules are designed to simplify when an investor transitions to and from being a New Zealand resident. The rules reflect that a person’s change of residency can be retrospective by the operation of the “183-day rule” in section YD 1(3) and that not all PIEs will be able to apply an investor’s new status immediately. Section CX 56 applies to an investor if that investor has become or ceased to be a New Zealand-resident in the tax year. For such an investor, any attributed PIE income will be excluded income, even if the investor is treated as a notified foreign investor when they are resident. Similarly, section HM 55E does not require a foreign investment PIE to change an investor’s status as soon as they are notified. At the latest the change needs to be effected by the start of the next tax year, but must be as soon as is practicable by the PIE. If a PIE’s systems are able to change an investor’s status quickly, it cannot defer the change to the start of the next tax year. As described above, if there is a delay in changing an investor’s status, there are no consequences for that investor. Allowable amounts for foreign investment zero rate PIEs Sections HM 19B, HM 55G and HM 55H Zero-rate PIEs are generally only supposed to derive foreign-sourced amounts. However, it is acknowledged that such PIEs will, in some situations need to derive some New Zealand-sourced income. Accordingly, zero-rate PIEs are permitted to derive the following “allowable amounts”. Income from financial arrangements Zero-rate PIEs are able to derive income from financial arrangements with a New Zealand-source in two situations. The first situation is if the arrangements do not pay interest and relate to the PIE’s offshore investments. “Offshore investments” in this context is intended to have a similar meaning to that in the modified source rules, discussed above. The second situation is if the arrangements pay only interest income and have a term of 90 days or less (or no term at all). This exemption only applies if the total value of the PIE’s financial arrangements that have a term of 90 days or less (but not including any non-interest arrangements as described above), is less than 5% of the total value of the PIE’s investments (including the value of any non-interest arrangements). In both cases, “interest” is intended to have its defined meaning – that is, a payment made for money lent to any person. 15 The purpose of the first exemption is to allow zero-rate PIEs to enter into derivatives (such as foreign currency hedges) in New Zealand. The purpose of the second exemption is to allow these PIEs to have New Zealand bank accounts to fund day-to- day management costs. Income from dividends Zero-rate PIEs are also able to derive income from New Zealand dividends if the total value of all shares held by the PIE in New Zealand-resident companies is less than 1% of its investments. The purpose of this exemption is to allow PIEs that track a global share index to be zero-rate PIEs, even though they may have a small exposure to New Zealand equity. Income from other foreign investment zero-rate PIEs Income from other zero-rate PIEs (or PIEs that could be zero-rate PIEs if they elected to be one) also count as an “allowable amount”. This is on the basis that the ultimate investments of the PIE will be offshore. This forms a similar flow-through rule provided to variable-rate PIEs by section HM 6B(3). Example A variable rate PIE has the following New Zealand-sourced financial arrangements: • $5000 in a 30-day term deposit, paying interest at 5% p.a., • $10000 in an on-call account, paying interest at 1.43% p.a., • a foreign-exchange hedge (which does not pay any interest), designed to remove the effect of currency fluctuations on its offshore investments, with a market value of $7500. The total value of all of the PIE’s other investments is currently $285,000 and the income from these investments does not have a New Zealand source. The total value of the PIE’s investments is $307,500. The PIE has $15000 in interest-bearing financial arrangements with a term of 90 days or less, or no term at all. As a percent of total investments this is 4.88%. The PIE therefore meets the requirement of deriving only foreign-sourced amounts and “allowable amounts”. The PIE’s New Zealand-sourced financial arrangements that pay interest both have a term of 90 days or less and constitute less than 5% of the PIE’s investment portfolio. The only other New Zealand-sourced income that the PIE could derive is from a non-interest bearing financial arrangement that relates to the PIE’s offshore investments. 16 Breaches of the foreign investment PIE rules Section HM 55H Section HM 55H provides special breach rules for the additional requirements of foreign investment PIEs. The existing breach rules also apply to foreign investment PIEs where a requirement of being a normal PIE is not met. As with the original PIE rules, it is intended that whether or not a foreign investment PIE meets the relevant rules is to be tested every quarter. This is because requiring more frequent testing would be excessively costly from a compliance perspective. However, there are certain requirements that, if breached, have immediate consequences. Zero-rate PIEs Zero-rate PIEs are only allowed to derive foreign-sourced and “allowable” amounts. As described above, certain thresholds apply to some of these allowable amounts – for example, there is a maximum of 1% of total assets in New Zealand shares. If one of these thresholds is exceeded, that breach must be remedied on the last day of the next quarter (when the PIE will again do its quarterly check). If the breach is not remedied, the foreign investment zero-rate PIE will become a foreign investment variable-rate PIE on the first day of the third quarter. If, on the other hand, a zero-rate PIE derives an amount other than an allowable amount or a foreign sourced amount, the PIE will become a foreign investment variable-rate PIE immediately. The reason for this difference is that it was considered very unlikely that a PIE could inadvertently derive an amount other than a foreign-sourced or allowable amount, but it is feasible that a PIE could inadvertently breach a threshold for an allowable amount from time to time. Foreign investment variable rate PIEs Variable-rate PIEs are required to meet the requirements of sections HM 55F(3) and HM 19C. Among other things, these provisions require the PIE to identify the source and type of amounts of income derived. If one of these criteria is not met, then, similar to a foreign investment zero-rate PIE, the PIE will have until the last day of the next quarter to remedy the breach. If this is not done, the PIE will become an ordinary multi-rate PIE from the first day of the third quarter. Transitional rule The rules for foreign investment variable-rate PIEs do not come into force until 1 April 2012. Therefore, section HM 55H(5) provides that if a foreign investment zero-rate PIE breaches one of the rules and loses its status before 1 April 2012, it will become a multi-rate PIE. 17 Election to be a foreign investor PIE Sections HM 71B and HM 72 Section HM 71B provides that an entity can elect to become a foreign investment PIE if it: • is, or is eligible to be, a multi-rate PIE; • has, or intends to have, non-resident investors; and • does not use the provisional tax option of section HM 44 to pay its tax if the entity is a PIE. The entity’s election will have to include which type of foreign investment PIE it wishes to become. Finally, the existing rules providing when an entity’s election to become a PIE take effect have been modified to also apply to entities becoming foreign investment PIEs. Modified grouping rules Section IC 3 New subsection IC 3(2D) provides that a foreign investment PIE cannot be part of a group of companies that includes a land investment company. In other words, a foreign investment PIE is only able to group with wholly-owned PIEs. Yearly request of information Section 31C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Section 31C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been modified to provide that a foreign investment PIE must, at least once a year, ask its notified foreign investors to confirm that: • they are still eligible to be a notified foreign investor; and • the information the PIE is required to collect under section 28D(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has not changed. If the PIE receives no response, the PIE may continue to treat the investor as a notified foreign investor.
1 1 September 2011 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Gift duty abolition Sections 2(2) and 61 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 The new legislation abolishes gift duty for dispositions of property made on or after 1 October 2011. The change follows a review of gift duty, which revealed that the compliance costs far outweigh both the revenue it collects and the limited protections it has offered to prevent tax avoidance, social assistance targeting and defeat of creditors. The definition of a “gift” in section 2 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA) is amended so that the term refers only to dispositions of property before 1 October 2011. The Bill also amends section 61 of the EGDA to ensure that gift duty is payable only for gifts made from the Act’s commencement until 1 October 2011. Background Gift duty has existed in New Zealand since 1885. Its original purpose was to protect the estate duty base (by discouraging the gifting of assets before death) and to raise revenue. When estate duty was abolished in 1992, the government of the day decided to retain gift duty to protect against income tax avoidance and social assistance targeting until alternative protection measures could be introduced. Ministers and officials have received frequent requests for exemptions from gift duty and for a review of the gift duty thresholds over the past few years. The thresholds of $27,000 for non-dutiable gifts and $12,000 for the filing of gift statements were set in 1984 and have not been revised since. In addition, administration of gift duty has become antiquated, with no provision for the electronic filing of gift statements or any form of payment other than by cheque. Further, the valuation of annuities for the purposes of gifts under the Estate and Gift Duties Act is set according to life expectancy data that is more than 25 years out of date. 2 With this background, a review of gift duty was initiated. Options considered included: • narrowing the scope of gift duty to apply only to gifts between individuals, trusts and closely held companies; • raising the thresholds at which gift duty applies; • removing the requirement to file gift statements for non-liable gifts; • introducing electronic systems for the filing of gift statements and payment of gift duty; and • updating life-expectancy tables for valuing annuities under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. As the review progressed, a strong case for outright abolition emerged. Some of the concerns which existed in 1992 have been addressed or reduced by the strengthening of existing legislative provisions. Remaining areas of concern were scrutinised in consultation with the Treasury, the Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Health, New Zealand Police, the Ministry of Social Development, and Housing New Zealand Corporation. None of these agencies opposed gift duty abolition and several have said they will make administrative changes to support its abolition. The review concluded that gift duty no longer raises any significant revenue and imposes a high level of compliance costs on the private sector. The protections offered by gift duty in the areas of income tax, creditors and social assistance have been incidental rather than intended policy goals. The analysis undertaken across government revealed that the protection gift duty offers is inefficient, limited and outweighed by the significant compliance costs that it imposes on the private sector. Therefore Ministers decided to abolish gift duty and an effective date of 1 October 2011 was chosen to provide certainty for the private sector. The government agencies mentioned above will monitor the effects of gift duty abolition on their respective areas of responsibility and a post-implementation review will ensure there are no unintended consequences. Key features • Gift duty will not be payable for dispositions of property made on or after 1 October 2011. • Gift statements will not need to be filed for dispositions of property made on or after 1 October 2011. • Gift duty and gift statements will remain due for dispositions of property made prior to 1 October 2011. 3 Application date The new legislation abolishes gift duty for dispositions of property made on or after 1 October 2011. The EGDA remains effective with respect to dispositions of property before this date. Detailed analysis Record keeping requirements Gift statements will not be required for dispositions of property made on or after 1 October 2011. However, requirements to ensure the legal certainty of gifts, such as deeds of gift for trusts, are unchanged. Taxpayers may, therefore, still need to consult a lawyer when making a gift. Income tax implications The abolition of gift duty does not have any impact on income tax anti-avoidance rules. As has always been the case, a gift may be deemed to be part of a wider arrangement of tax avoidance under section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. There is a range of provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 designed to directly ensure integrity around arrangements involving gifts, in addition to the general anti-avoidance provisions. These include: • Section HC 35 minor beneficiary income rule; • Section EW 38 rules for the disposal of financial arrangements for less than fully adequate consideration; 1 • Section HD 15 joint and several liability of company directors and controlling or interested shareholders where a company enters into an arrangement that results in an inability to meet its tax liability; • Sections CD 6 – CD 6 deemed dividends for transfers of value from a company to an individual; • Section CX fringe benefit tax rules for gifts to employees; • Sections FC 1 and FC 2 treatment of distributions from companies and trusts, gifts, and transfers of assets and liabilities upon death as disposals and acquisitions at market value; • Section GC 1 rules for disposal of trading stock for less than fully adequate consideration; and 1 Section EW 44 provides an exception to this rule where the creditor forgives the debtor’s debt because of the natural love and affection the creditor has for the debtor. 4 • Section 10(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, which treats the associated supply of goods and services as if they were for market value where there is no fully adequate consideration. Gift duty abolition – questions we’ve been asked Q: Won’t gift duty abolition increase trust use? Why not wait until after the Law Commission’s Review of Trust Law is completed, before abolishing gift duty? A: The Law Commission’s Review of Trust Law seeks to address much broader issues than gift duty, including trust regulation, trust use and judicial responses. Gift duty is not the appropriate mechanism to deal with any inadequacies in New Zealand trust law, so the outcomes of the review are unlikely to impact on the decision to abolish gift duty. Although gift duty has made gifting compliance cost intensive, it has not stopped people from doing so. The gift duty review did not find any evidence to support the claim that the abolition of gift duty will lead to an increase in the number of trusts or the value of the assets that they hold. Gift duty has not prevented the considerable growth of trusts in New Zealand over the past 30 years. It should also be noted that, although gift duty abolition will reduce the compliance cost associated with gifting, there are still significant costs involved in establishing a trust, and deeds of gift will still be required in order to make new dispositions. Aside from cost, there are other important considerations that need to be considered in deciding whether to establish a trust, such as whether the potential settlor is willing to give up ownership and control over their assets and whether there are better ways of meeting their needs. Q: Won’t getting rid of gift statements mean that gifts will no longer be recorded? A: Due to the strict secrecy requirements of the Tax Administration Act 1994, Inland Revenue has not been able to provide details of gift statements to private entities or other government agencies, except to the Official Assignee and Police in limited circumstances. Therefore, gift statements have not provided the government with a general record of trusts or gifts, and they have not been used to determine eligibility for government entitlements such as residential care subsidy. In the absence of gift statements, evidence will continue to exist in the forms of deeds of gift, land transfer records for real property, registration details for motor vehicles and banking records for cash transfers. Each of these independent records could be expected to show both the donor and the recipient of the gift, just as gift statements have done. Q: What remedies are available to creditors when the debtor has gifted away their assets? A: Three existing statutes contain provisions to allow the claw-back of dispositions for the benefit of creditors: • Sections 204 and 205 of the Insolvency Act 2006 allow the Official Assignee to automatically cancel gifts made within two years before adjudication, or within five years if the bankrupt cannot demonstrate solvency at the time the gift was made; 5 • Section 292 of the Companies Act 1993 gives the Official Assignee similar powers but over shorter timeframes (6 months and 2 years); and • Subpart 6 of the Property Law Act 2007 empowers the Courts to set aside property dispositions where there was an intention to prejudice the interests of a creditor. This provision is not time-limited. The Ministry of Economic Development has committed to monitor future cases brought under these Acts, and a government-wide post-implementation review will consider any impacts resulting from gift duty abolition. Q: What remedies are available in relationship property disputes where one partner has gifted away their assets? Are there any remedies if a person is not adequately provided for under a will and the testator gifted away assets prior to death? A: The effect of gift duty abolition on relationship property rights and succession claims was considered as part of the gift duty review, in consultation with the Ministry of Justice. The review concluded that gift duty has not been a means of addressing any perceived problems with relationship property and succession law, as gift duty has not prevented dispositions from occurring, though it has had practical impact on how some dispositions have been structured in terms of their timing. Ministry of Justice officials do not consider changes to the Property (Relationships) Act, Family Protection Act and the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act are required. The underlying philosophy of these Acts is that individuals are generally free to deal with their own property as they wish – any entitlement one person may have to the property of another does not arise until the actual event of separation or death. There are several legislative provisions that may remedy gifts made in some circumstances: • The Property (Relationships) Act allows the courts to restrain or to set aside transfers of property to trusts where there was an intention to defeat a spouse’s or partner’s claim at the time the disposition was made. • If the disposition was not intended to defeat a claim, but had that effect, the courts are able to grant compensation (although in this circumstance the court cannot set aside the trust). Compensation can include other non-trust assets or the income of the trust, but does not include the capital of the trust (the power to unwind the trust could disadvantage other beneficiaries, including children of the relationship). • Section 182 of the Family Proceedings Act allows the court to vary the terms of an agreement or settlement (made before or after a marriage or civil union) if, at the end of the marriage or civil union, an applicant no longer derives the benefit he or she reasonably expected to receive from the agreement or settlement. This includes the ability for the courts to vest part of a trust in an affected partner, for their benefit. The Ministry of Justice will monitor any impacts of gift duty abolition to inform the government-wide post-implementation review.

### Speech

### Opening Address to Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand Annual Conference  
Copthorne Hotel, Waitangi  
 

Good afternoon, and thank you very much for inviting me to speak to you again.  
  
Looking back over the past year, much has changed since the last time I addressed you, but also a great deal still remains to be done.  
As we contemplate the uncertainty ahead for both New Zealand’s and the world’s economies, one thing is certain – the old ways are gone forever and we need to find ways to be more innovative if we are to map out the kind of future that we want for this country.  
  
And the events of the recent past have certainly caused massive upheaval.  
  
When I attended your conference in March last year, Christchurch was only just coming to terms with the most destructive earthquake in living memory the month before.  
  
February 22 changed everything for Canterbury and for New Zealand.  
  
We have just marked the first anniversary of the quake, and Christchurch and the nation are still feeling the on-going effects and will be for some time to come.  
  
The 2008 Global Financial Crisis changed our world forever.

Easy acceptance of massive debt changed almost overnight and now governments, business and individuals alike are much more focused on fiscal prudence.

If we are to ride out future economic shocks, we urgently need to reduce our dependence on overseas debt, build our capital and return the economy to surplus as soon as possible.

A sound tax system is a good platform for the Government to begin consolidating and strengthening the economy and getting on with rebuilding Christchurch.

The GFC and the Canterbury quakes have taught us, amongst other things that we as a people need to be more prepared and more agile.  
They have forced us to consider new ways to work more efficiently, and this, essentially, is what I want to talk to you about today.

### Work programme

Later this month I will release fuller details of the tax policy work programme for the next eighteen months.

The programme will be strongly focused on helping us return to surplus and building our economy.

It aims to do this, not by introducing new tax regimes, but through some might say mundane, but sensible measures which align neatly with the Government’s priorities as outlined in the Prime Minister’s start of year speech:

*   The responsible management of Government’s finances
*   Building a more competitive and productive economy
*   Delivering better public services to New Zealanders, within the tight budget the Government is operating under, and
*   rebuilding Christchurch.

Obviously to do these things in an environment of strict fiscal restraint and without borrowing further, we need to raise revenue to fund government services and functions.

Now there are all manner of strange and wonderful new taxes that could be introduced to raise revenue if that was our only objective.

We are not doing that.

What we are doing is working with the system we have, which is in pretty good shape after the reforms of Budget 2010, and ensuring that the tax burden is shared equally and that the current rules are working as intended.

The focus is on constantly making the system work better.

It is the sensible thing to do and we need to be sensible if we are to have an enduring, robust economy and help Christchurch.

And speaking of Christchurch, work continues in this area on the tax front, mainly with regard to depreciation.

The tax system has been able to provide tangible and valuable help for the people of Christchurch.

Most recently was the further extending of Inland Revenue’s discretion to remit interest on late payments where people are unable to meet their tax obligations because of the earthquake.

For this support to continue and to provide government services across New Zealand, it is crucial that tax collection continues, but that it does so in an efficient and fair manner.

Along with raising revenue, the work programme will also include work to:

*   Provide an environment that supports economic efficiency and growth;
*   Minimise tax administration costs and compliance costs for taxpayers;
*   Provide on-going maintenance work on the tax system to ensure its effectiveness; and
*   Provide capacity (and flexibility) to deal with emerging and critical issues.

### Public service efficiency

Another thing we learned from the Canterbury earthquakes is that government agencies can be very flexible and find new ways to work if need be.  
  
So for example, we found courts being convened on marae and different agencies, such as Work and Income and Inland Revenue working together to provide frontline services to those in need.  
  
That spirit of the public service working more cohesively together is to be encouraged and the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act passed last year provides for greater sharing of information held by Inland Revenue with other government agencies, subject to a range of restrictions.

It makes little sense that a person dealing with a number of different agencies has to provide the same basic information to each agency.

Sharing information is therefore a rational and efficient way for the public to interact with the public service.

There is a cost to collecting taxes, a cost which of course is borne by the taxpayer, so anything which reduces Inland Revenue’s costs is good for the taxpayer.

### Inland Revenue’s business transformation

And currently, Inland Revenue’s technology systems are ageing and our ability to implement complex or major policy change is declining over time .

In the last few years it has become increasingly apparent that a system designed well before the advent of the internet and e-services has become a significant challenge to the efficiency of our tax administration.

More so because of the very constrained fiscal situation.

Inland Revenue’s FIRST system, originally intended for the efficient administration of tax has over recent years, has also been used to administer a great many non-tax programmes such as student loans, Child Support and KiwiSaver.

This has resulted in greater systems complexity, loss of agility and efficiency, and increased administration costs.

The combination of new technology and rapid changes in Inland Revenue's role means we cannot rely on more of the same to work for us in the future, hence the need for a transformation of our systems to continue to ensure the efficient operation of our tax system into the future.

The economic and fiscal position calls for a tax system that is as efficient as possible in raising the revenue the Government needs to meet its funding requirements.

Work in this area is currently being progressed with an expectation of a fuller understanding of its scope by mid-year.

### Electronic filing

I have also had an on-going interest in seeing a reduction in the amount of paper generated through correspondence with Inland Revenue.  
  
I am therefore heartened by the way that you as tax agents have taken to electronic services and I congratulate you on that.  
  
It is a win-win as far as I can see — good for your clients and your business as well as being good for the public service.

More work is being done in this area and a Bill currently before the House contains proposals you may be aware of which, broadly speaking, smooth the way for electronic storage of business records.  
  
The objectives of the proposals are to support employers currently working in an electronic environment and reduce compliance costs for employers in meeting their filing and record keeping obligations.

### Fairness

Perhaps the greatest strength of the New Zealand tax system is that not only is it a broad based, low rate system, but it is one that is comparatively simple.

Tax, almost by definition, is complex, but our system makes intuitive sense.

Work continues on reducing complexity, improving fairness and maintaining the integrity of the tax system.

Anything which simplifies the tax system is a good thing.

Both the courts and Inland Revenue have made it clear that businesses are free to use company and trust structures – as long as these are not used in an artificial and contrived manner to defeat tax law.

Inland Revenue has again emphasised that it will focus only on the most serious and artificial cases, which is a very pragmatic approach in my view.

Of course the changes in Budget 2010 have gone a long way to preventing the opportunity for such cases to arise by aligning the top personal and trustee tax rates.

### Preventing debt and promoting return filing

And as we all know, prevention is better than cure.

Inland Revenue has therefore been active in preventing debt and taking proactive action to help minimise penalties and interest.

Contacting customers over the phone soon after they get into debt has seen Inland Revenue collect an extra $115.3 million, as of 30 June last year, against a target of $100 million.

Last year’s February 7 campaign involving letters, text messages and phone calls promoting the payment deadline, saw 11 per cent more customers paying on time than was achieved the year before.

The actual figures were 83 per cent; up from 72 per cent in 2010.

This is a good example of working smarter.

And the Department is working to improve on that this year.

Inland Revenue recognises and appreciates the hard work you do in supporting your clients to:

*   avoid unnecessary penalties and interest by meeting their obligations, or
*   get back on track quickly if they have missed a filing or payment deadline.

### Conclusion

So to sum up, I would like to say that the way ahead for the global and the New Zealand economy is uncertain but we have learned the lessons of the past and our economy and tax system are now better equipped to deal with economic turmoil.

Government can help to grow the economy, and through our tax system, we can help provide the environment and factors which nurture and sustain a growing economy.

We are confident that our tax system is in good shape after the Budget 2010 reforms and the way that tax shelter opportunities have been minimised.

The tax policy work programme for the next eighteen months is based on sound policy that aims to make our tax system more efficient and fairer.

What we will be looking to do is work smarter – to do more with what we have.

Thank you

Further extension to earthquake support
=======================================

An Order-in-Council originally made after the Canterbury earthquakes has been extended to ensure that support for Canterbury residents continues. This allows Inland Revenue the discretion to extend statutory tax dates on a case or class-of-cases basis.  For more information see the Minister of Revenue's [media statement](/news/2012/2012-03-12-further-extension-earthquake-support#statement)
 or the Inland Revenue [fact sheet](/news/2012/2012-03-12-further-extension-earthquake-support#Facts)

### Extension of filing time provision extended for Canterbury

“It’s one year on since the big earthquake in Canterbury and Government recognises that people in Canterbury are still dealing with very difficult circumstances,” says Revenue Minister Peter Dunne.

“The Government has therefore extended a temporary measure introduced after the February earthquakes for a further six months,” Mr Dunne announced today.

The Canterbury Earthquake (Inland Revenue Acts) Amendment Order 2012 continues until 1 October 2012, Inland Revenue's ability to extend time limits for meeting tax obligations. This measure provides extra time for businesses to prepare and file returns that in many cases, would otherwise fall due at the end of the month.

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue currently has the discretion to extend statutory tax dates on a case or class-of-cases basis. Following discussions with Canterbury based practitioners, Inland Revenue’s discretion to extend time limits has been continued for a further six months, in recognition that taxpayers and agents are still experiencing difficulties meeting some time limits specified in tax legislation, as many businesses are still dealing with lost records and disrupted systems.

“Despite everything they have to contend with, Christchurch businesses have made great efforts in complying with their tax obligations. Extending this temporary measure is a recognition of the difficulties people are still facing and is a practical measure we can take to help those businesses get back on their feet,” says Mr Dunne.

Further information on the extensions of time to comply with tax obligations is contained in a fact sheet on Inland Revenue’s policy website at taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz.

### Fact sheet - Extensions of time to meet your obligations

#### Introduction

This fact sheet provides information about extensions of time that Inland Revenue may grant when you have been unable to comply with tax obligations because of the Canterbury earthquake. It updates and replaces the previous fact sheet released on 28 March 2011.

#### Legislation

Inland Revenue may extend any time limit that appears in tax legislation, under the Canterbury Earthquake (Inland Revenue Acts) Order 2011, as amended by the Canterbury Earthquake (Inland Revenue Acts) Amendment Order 2012.

A time limit can be extended if:

*   you are unable to comply with the limit because of the Canterbury earthquake of 4 September 2010 or any of its aftershocks (including the one on 22 February); and
*   it would be fair and equitable to extend the limit in the circumstances.

For example, a person may be unable to comply with a time limit when necessary tax records are in the ‘red zone’ in the Christchurch CBD and cannot be retrieved. Or a person’s tax agent may have had their business disrupted because of the earthquake. Extensions are likely to be granted in these cases.

Examples of time limits that may be extended are:

*   dates for filing income tax returns (including extensions for 2010-11 income tax returns beyond 31 March 2012);
*   dates for providing information requested by Inland Revenue (including information you must provide to retain Working for Families payments);
*   dates for making elections; and
*   dates for making tax payments (if, for example, access to bank accounts has been difficult because of your circumstances).

Inland Revenue may impose conditions on an extension of time. For example, you may be asked to provide documents to show you have been affected by the earthquake. If conditions are imposed, you will be told about this.

If you receive an extension of time, you will need to meet the extended time limit. Otherwise, the normal use-of-money interest and penalties for lateness would apply from the expiry of the extended time limit.

If you do not meet any conditions imposed on the extension, or if you have misled Inland Revenue when providing information about your circumstances, the original time limit (and not the extended time limit) will apply and the normal consequences of lateness would apply from that original time.

The power to extend time limits under the Canterbury Earthquake (Inland Revenue Acts) Order 2011 is a temporary measure. It was first introduced on 28 March 2011 and has since been further extended to 1 October 2012; its use will be reviewed again at that time.

#### Contact us

If you are unable to meet any of your tax obligations due to the Canterbury earthquake please contact Inland Revenue on 0800 473 566 to discuss your individual circumstances and, if necessary, extension of time arrangements.

If you use a tax agent to handle your affairs, please contact them in the first instance.

### Tax policy work programme 2012/13 announced

“A sound tax system is a good platform for Government to begin consolidating and strengthening the economy and getting on with rebuilding” says Revenue Minister Peter Dunne.

Mr Dunne was speaking at the International Fiscal Association’s annual conference today where he released details of the Government’s tax policy work programme for the next eighteen months.

The new tax policy work programme consolidates the reforms to the tax system of recent years. Mr Dunne says that after the tax reforms of Budget 2010, the tax system is in good shape.

The work programme also supports the Government’s plan to get back to surplus through the responsible management of Government’s finances, says Mr Dunne.

The tax policy work programme for 2012/13 aims to support the government’s priorities to:

*   responsibly manage the Government’s finances and tax system
*   build a more competitive and productive economy
*   deliver better public services
*   rebuild Canterbury

The new tax policy work programme has a strong focus on increasing efficiency and fairness in the system. Amongst a range of initiatives intended to improve efficiency and fairness, the work programme also includes work on items first announced in Budget 2011 and further work relating to Student Loan repayments from overseas-based borrowers.

“Now, more than ever, it is essential to have a good, cost-effective tax system – one that collects the necessary revenue efficiently – meaning low economic costs, low compliance costs and low administrative costs” Mr Dunne says.

### Speech

### Address to IFA annual conference  
Queenstown  
 

Thank you very much for inviting me to speak to you again.

Much has changed since I spoke to you last year, but also a great deal still remains to be done.

This time last year we were still coming to grips the devastating Christchurch earthquakes – and there have been more since, having not only just a profound effect on the people of Christchurch, but also on the country as a whole, and the very psyche of our nation.

The imperative of helping Christchurch recover has absorbed us at almost every level of society, in a way we have never had to confront before, nor imagined we would ever face in this country.

It is not just the impact on the Budget deficit – considerable as it has been done – but also the impact on so many lives and businesses, and the way in which we deliver services to the people of Canterbury.

If that unprecedented crisis alone is not sufficient, we have also had to brace ourselves for further turbulence from offshore.

Plus ça change, as our European friends would say.

The Greek government has managed to cobble together a deal and the immediate crisis for now appears to have been averted.

The world economy however, is not out of the woods yet.

The austerity measures demanded as part of the Greek deal will not be easy to implement and while lessened, the threat of recession still hangs over Europe.

Much of Europe’s response to date appears to have been driven by the new alliance of Germany’s Chancellor Merkel and France’s President Sarkozy.

It is an open question as how much of that momentum can be retained, if President Sarkozy is not re-elected President of France in the next few weeks.

And if that were not a sufficient puzzle, we need only recall that the Asian economies appear to be going off the boil.

A downturn in Asia would surely be bad news.

China is now our second-largest trading partner.

A decline in Chinese economic growth, with a subsequent reduced demand for minerals from Australia, our largest trading partner, would have clear consequences for New Zealand.

The point is that world markets are notoriously skittish and we want to avoid a situation where we are rushing about applying quick-fix measures every time a new crisis arises.

In a situation where we are living through the most challenging economic circumstances since the Great Depression we need, above all else, to be keeping our nerve, and focusing on what needs to be done, rather than lurching from one short-term palliative, to the next.

If we are to ride out future economic shocks, we urgently need to reduce our dependence on overseas debt, build up our capital stock and return the Government’s books to surplus as quickly as possible.

All this leads me to the Government’s priorities as outlined in a recent speech by the Prime Minister.

*   The responsible management of Government’s finances
*   Building a more competitive and productive economy
*   Delivering better public services to New Zealanders, within the tight budget the Government is operating under, and
*   Rebuilding Christchurch.

A sound tax system is a good platform for Government to begin consolidating and strengthening the economy and getting on with rebuilding.

The updated tax policy work programme agreed between the Minister of Finance and me supports these priorities and I would like to share some of the details of the work programme with you.

But before I begin talking about the work programme in detail, I would like to provide some context – a philosophical entrée, if you like - to give you an insight into some of the thinking that has gone into the development of this tax policy work programme.

It goes like this.

2012 is going to hold challenges with economic uncertainty ahead.

An important contribution the government can make to help the country withstand offshore economic shocks is to get the government’s finances in order, get debt under control and reduce our over-reliance on foreign debt.

Rising debt means greater debt servicing costs, which crowds out more worthwhile expenditure.

It also leaves us vulnerable to moves by credit ratings agencies, which can impose higher economy-wide interest rates.

So it is important that New Zealand maintains robust taxes to finance government spending in ways that are as fair and efficient as possible.

To assist with returning to surplus, we need to raise the revenue we need to fund Government services and functions.

Typically the things a government can do to raise revenue are:

1.  Apply existing tax bases more broadly to reduce distortions to investment and increase fairness so that the tax burden is spread more evenly.
2.  Increase tax rates on existing bases.
3.  Extend existing tax bases so that income tax for example is widened to cover capital gains.
4.  Introduce a completely new tax base, and lastly
5.  Put more focus on enforcing current rules.

Now if simply raising a lot of new revenue is the only objective, there are all manner of things we could do.

We could raise significant amounts very quickly by increasing tax rates, extending the tax base and imposing new taxes but at what cost?

Yes, we need to raise revenue to reduce further borrowing and get us on a more secure footing, but what New Zealand needs even more is investment flowing into productive sectors of the economy.

Now, more than ever, it is essential to have a good, cost-effective tax system – one that collects the necessary revenue efficiently and at minimal cost – meaning low economic costs, low compliance costs and low administrative costs.

Crucially, what we need for our economy is a cohesive, considered policy work programme, free from ad hoc measures developed in reaction to the latest perceived crisis.

This programme gives business the certainty of where the economy is heading and how it will get there.

Another point I would make about our tax system is that it is well regarded internationally for its coherence and simplicity.

You have to ask yourself, why is that so?

I believe the answer lies in an understanding and acceptance across several past governments and the private sector that a tax system is essentially just that.

It is a means for taxing, and not a means for solving society’s ills.

Of course we do have some aspects of that in our system – the duty on tobacco is a prime example, but compared with other tax systems, we are relatively free of such instruments.

Once you start burdening the system with policy levers to engineer social change, the system begins to lose coherence and distortion creeps in.

And that will erode the ability of the tax system to carry out its primary function – to tax in order to fund government services and functions.

It is not about envy, or settling old political scores.

For a system such as ours - which relies on voluntary compliance- simplicity and coherence are all-important.

The tax system must be free to carry out its primary function and in doing so, allow investment to flow naturally.

A good tax policy work programme therefore does not set out to change the world.

Instead, it focuses on doing what a tax system does best and aims to improve that.

So the work programme I am announcing today has a strong focus on increasing efficiency and fairness in the system.

In doing so, it will also raise extra revenue – it has to.

That is the responsible thing to do and right now, we need responsible fiscal management.

A key platform for the Government’s plan to get back to surplus is through the responsible management of Government’s finances.

Part of this as I have already indicated, is achieved by sustainably raising revenue.

Perhaps more importantly, the central theme for this work programme is the desire to make the system fairer.

The tax burden must be shared equitably and this aligns neatly with the Government’s first priority of responsibly managing Government’s finances.

As an aside, I would add that now is probably not the time to be moving the line on tax avoidance.

I am more focused on making sure we collect the revenue currently legitimately due to us through our broad based, low rate system, before embarking on new taxes, which almost inevitably would fall more harshly on some than others.

The final point I want to make about the tax work programme before I go into the detail, is that it has not been developed in isolation.

Officials have consulted with the private sector on this.

### Small and medium enterprises

The Government is focused on supporting businesses to grow and there are several items on the work programme designed to assist businesses.

In particular a large number of small and medium enterprises will benefit from some of the policy initiatives being considered.

These measures will have compliance costs savings for SMEs and are part of a continued focus on growing businesses.

In 2009, for example, the Government allocated $484 million over the forecast period for a SME tax assistance package that further simplified tax arrangements for SMEs and reduced their compliance costs, giving greater support for small businesses to grow.

The Government has also recently announced that most small and medium enterprises with annual revenue of less than $30 million and assets less than $60 million will no longer be required to prepare general purpose financial reports.  
Inland Revenue will also be introducing minimum financial reporting requirements for these companies.

The application date for this has yet to be confirmed.

By minimising compliance costs, we encourage growth by making the tax system fairer.

Let me continue the theme of fairness, by discussing items first announced as part of Budget 2011.

### Mixed use assets

When assets – for instance, holiday homes, planes and yachts - are used partly for private purposes and partly to derive assessable income, it is necessary to determine what proportion of expenses can be deducted in deriving that income.

Maintaining the current treatment of these mixed use assets in my view, is tantamount to asking the taxpayer to subsidise the assets.

An officials’ issues paper released last year suggested new rules categorising mixed-use assets into different groups based on the underlying use of the asset, and prescribed the level of deductions that owners in each group can claim.

Some very useful consultation has followed and the policy is now being finalised.  
The final proposals will be in a tax bill towards the middle of the year.

### Employee benefits

The issue here is that some people are not taxed equally and/or receive unfair entitlements to social assistance programmes.

In the interests of a fairer and more economically efficient tax system the question we had to ask ourselves was whether the tax rules should be further widened to include untaxed benefits that are substitutes for salary, particularly when a salary trade-off is involved.

Furthermore, in a number of instances those benefits, and fringe benefits more generally, are often not included in the definition of income for social assistance purposes (such as entitlement to Working for Families).

This is unfair to people in genuine need and to the taxpaying public which foots the bill for these assistance programmes.

Budget 2010 broadened the definition of income for social assistance purposes to provide a better measure of family income.

This included attributed fringe benefits provided to shareholder-employees who control a closely held company, with the question being left open at that time as to whether more non-cash benefit situations should be included at a later date.

An officials’ issues paper is being prepared, providing some suggestions in these areas.

I anticipate the paper being released before the middle of this year.

### Valuation of livestock

A fairness issue appears to exist with the current livestock valuation mechanism.  
The nub of it is that at present, farmers can choose to value their livestock under two systems.

The problem arises when a farmer is able to switch back and forth at will between the two methods choosing the more favourable outcome for tax purposes.

The net result can be that the increases in market valuations go untaxed, while decreases in valuation can be eligible for tax deductions.

Livestock is an asset like any other and I think the fairness question arises when you consider that no other industry enjoys such latitude with regard to the tax treatment of its assets.

Another aspect of fairness and the responsible management of the Government’s finances and the tax system is improving the coherence of the system.

### Taxing New Zealand residents’ foreign superannuation

The taxation of New Zealand residents’ foreign superannuation can be very complex.

This complexity arises in part, from the fact that the current rules for taxing New Zealand residents on their foreign superannuation are not necessarily coherent.

Lack of coherence can also lead to outcomes that may not be fair.

A review of foreign superannuation has therefore been included in the work programme.

A discussion document is expected be released in the first half of 2012, with legislation likely to be introduced in late 2012.

### Black hole expenditure

The issue of black hole expenditure — in other words, business expenditure that does not result in a tax deduction — can be a vexed one.

Just because a business incurs expenditure does not automatically mean it should be deductible — either immediately or over time.

If the expenditure is incurred to provide an enduring benefit, generally the correct treatment is to deny a deduction.

If however, a business incurs expenditure to provide benefits over a finite period, the correct treatment is to provide a deduction over that period.

The trick in this area is deciding which category a particular expenditures falls into.

This is not always an easy exercise and private sector input has been very valuable.

The Government is aware of a number of black hole expenditure items that should qualify for a deduction.

Denying a deduction in these circumstances distorts investment decisions and therefore damages the economy.

We have therefore decided to progress a number of remedial amendments in the area of black hole expenditure as a matter of priority.  
These are in the areas of costs incurred on certain fixed life resource consents and certain company administration costs

Consideration of amortisation of capital raising costs is not on the new work programme — the Government considers this is a matter to be revisited once fiscal pressures ease, and once work begins in that area, the usual public consultation will occur.

### A competitive and productive economy

Consultation is of course key, and I mentioned before that the tax policy work programme is developed in consultation with the private sector.

Naturally, the private sector has an interest in seeing an environment that supports growth.

The work plan for the next eighteen months therefore I am pleased to tell you includes a number of items which align with the views offered by the private sector, including active income exemption for branches and seeking mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits with Australia.

These are two of a number of items raised by the private sector and adopted onto the work programme as officials considered they would add to the fairness and efficiency of the tax system.

Of course any discussion of efficiency of the tax system and the tax administration must also include mention of the systems used by Inland Revenue.

### Inland Revenue’s business transformation

Inland Revenue’s technology systems are ageing and our ability to implement complex or major policy change is declining over time.  
In the last few years it has become increasingly apparent that a system designed well before the advent of the internet and e-services has become a significant challenge to the efficiency of our tax administration.

Inland Revenue’s FIRST system, originally intended solely for the administration of tax, has seen its role expand to include the administration of a great many non-tax programmes such as student loans, Child Support and KiwiSaver.

This has resulted in greater systems complexity, loss of agility and efficiency, and increased administration costs.

Clearly, steps have to be taken to continue to ensure the efficient operation of our tax system into the future.

The economic and fiscal position calls for a tax system that is as efficient as possible in raising the revenue the Government needs to meet its funding requirements, and flexible enough to accommodate future changes.  
Work in this area is currently being progressed as a key priority with an expectation of a fuller understanding of its scope by mid-year.

### Welfare reform

Last month’s release of the Government’s intended direction with welfare reforms has indicated a strong focus for the Government in this term.

The tax policy work programme will provide input on tax issues such as Flexi-Superannuation and sharing of information, including for law enforcement purposes.

Elements of this work are likely to require legislation to support operational and other change.

The final item I will mention is also the Government’s final priority—Rebuilding Canterbury.

### Rebuilding Canterbury

Last year, the tax work programme was expanded hastily to respond to the earthquakes in Canterbury.

There are a number of tax issues arising from the Canterbury earthquakes, principally regarding the treatment of insurance proceeds and depreciation of damaged property.

We have attempted to respond deftly and flexibly to these challenges, to make it as easy as possible for Canterbury people and businesses to meet their tax obligations, while recognising all the while the many other stresses in their lives at present will often mean that tax is the last thing they want to think about.

At an operational level, Inland Revenue is now spread across many different sites in Christchurch, and new working partnerships have been developed, often through sheer force of circumstances, with other government agencies, which are leading to more joined up services, and in so doing, teaching valuable lessons for the future, not just for service provision in Christchurch, but across the country as well.

### Conclusion

These, then, are some of the high priority projects on the new tax policy work programme and I hope this has given you some idea of the thinking and conditions that have influenced its development.

The development of the work programme is a complex business requiring the consideration of a range of different factors including the public good, examination of international and domestic economic conditions, the resources and time needed for policy development, legislation and implementation, as well as communication and consultation.

It must also take cognisance of practical matters relating to tax administration, such as Inland Revenue’s technology systems.

What I feel we have produced is a cohesive, balanced work programme.

I would make the point that one thing that policy makers have learned from the onset of the Global Financial Crisis and the Canterbury earthquakes is that a well-designed, agreed work programme can be overtaken by events, and work diverted elsewhere at a moment’s notice.

So although this work programme will evolve, what I have outlined should give you a greater understanding of the Government's direction in tax policy.

More details of the work programme can be found on the tax policy website – taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz

Once again, I thank you and the organisations that many of you represent for the important contribution that you make to tax policy development in taking part in the consultative process.

I wish you a very successful conference.

Address to EMA payroll conference
=================================

In his [address](/news/2012/2012-03-29-address-ema-payroll-conference#speech)
 to the Exporters and Manufacturers Association’s annual payroll conference, the Minister of Revenue Peter Dunne discussed some of the Government’s tax work which has implications for payroll practitioners.

Hon Peter Dunne  
Minister of Revenue

### Speech

### Speech to 15th Annual Employers and Manufacturers Association Payroll Conference  
Rendezvous Hotel, Auckland

Good morning and thank you very much for inviting me to be with you again today.  
  
I always enjoy coming to speak to you.  
  
At the heart of every economy is the crucial business of people receiving their pay correctly and on time, allowing them to plan how they spend, save or invest.  
  
And as you are the people who make this happen, Payroll, in many respects, is the engine room of the economy.

### Tax obligations

Let me put that into perspective.  
  
Government services and functions include police, social welfare, conservation programmes and so on as well as building and maintaining roads, hospitals and schools.  
  
And it is your tax dollars and mine that pay for all this.  
  
Of the roughly $60 billion total tax collected each year, around $21 billion comes from PAYE alone.  
  
So thank you for your work on behalf of all New Zealanders.  
  
For the Government, it is a huge responsibility to ensure that the money that Kiwis pay in taxes is spent wisely and that changes to the tax system will not damage other parts of the system or overly disadvantage anyone.  
  
Earlier this month I announced details of the Government’s tax policy work programme which sets the tax system's direction and objectives for the next eighteen months.  
  
It contains carefully devised plans supporting the Government’s aspirations for New Zealand, including;

*   responsibly managing the Government’s finances and tax system \[coherence/integrity\]
*   building a more competitive and productive economy
*   delivering better public services, and
*   rebuilding Canterbury

Clearly the private sector has an interest in this so in developing the tax policy work programme, private sector representative groups are consulted.  
  
This consultation is crucial as the work programme will affect a wide range of aspects of the tax system and its administration.  
  
That is why we have what is called the Generic Tax Policy Process.

### Consultation

Since 1994, tax policy has been developed using the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP).  
  
This is a very open and interactive process which helps ensure that tax policy changes are well thought through.  
  
The GTPP was introduced to ensure better, more effective tax policy development through early consideration of key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals, such as their revenue impact, compliance and administrative costs, and economic and social objectives.  
  
I believe that the GTPP is a good process which has produced a sound tax policy work programme for 2012/13.  
  
Amongst a range of initiatives intended to improve efficiency and fairness, the work programme includes proposals first announced as part of Budget 2011 to review taxation in certain situations to ensure fairness.

### Employee benefits

One of those that I would like to discuss, focuses on people who, depending on how they are remunerated, are not taxed equally and/or receive differing entitlements to social assistance programmes.  
  
In the interests of a fairer and more economically efficient tax system a question we had to ask ourselves is whether the tax rules should include untaxed benefits that are substitutes for salary, particularly when a salary trade-off is involved.  
  
Furthermore, in a number of instances those benefits, and fringe benefits more generally, are often not included in the definition of income for social assistance purposes (such as entitlement to Working for Families).  
  
This is unfair to people in genuine need and to the taxpaying public which foots the bill for these assistance programmes.  
  
Budget 2010 broadened the definition of income for social assistance purposes to provide a better measure of family income.  
  
This included attributed fringe benefits provided to shareholder-employees who control a closely held company, with the question being left open at that time as to whether more non-cash benefit situations should be included at a later date.  
  
An officials’ issues paper is being prepared, providing some suggestions in these areas.  
  
I anticipate the paper being released before the middle of this year and will be available on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website.  
As important contributors to the efficient working of the tax system, I invite you to study the suggestions in that document and make a submission.  
Your views are very important.  
  
As Minister of Revenue, your participation as part of the GTPP gives me the confidence that tax proposals which have been consulted on are workable and practical and will add to the fairness and efficiency of the tax system.  
  
Of course any discussion of efficiency of the tax system and the tax administration must also include mention of the systems used by Inland Revenue.

### Inland Revenue’s business transformation

Inland Revenue’s technology systems are ageing and our ability to implement complex or major policy change is declining over time.  
  
In the last few years it has become increasingly apparent that a system designed well before the advent of the internet and e-services has become a significant challenge to the efficiency of our tax administration.  
  
Inland Revenue’s FIRST system, originally intended solely for the administration of tax, has seen its role expand to include the administration of a great many non-tax programmes such as student loans, Child Support and KiwiSaver.  
  
This has resulted in greater systems complexity, loss of agility and efficiency, and increased administration costs.  
  
Clearly, steps have to be taken to continue to ensure the efficient operation of our tax system into the future.  
  
Work in this area is currently being progressed as a key priority with an expectation of a fuller understanding of its scope by mid-year.  
  
The economic and fiscal position calls for a tax system that is as efficient as possible in raising the revenue the Government needs to meet its funding requirements, and flexible enough to accommodate future changes.

### Public service efficiency

An important part of getting the Government books back into surplus is the Government itself working more efficiently so as to reduce the burden on taxpayers.  
  
Government agencies are being encouraged to eliminate waste and find new ways to work more efficiently meaning lower administration costs and lower compliance costs.  
  
After the earthquake of 22 February 2011, and with many public buildings inaccessible, government agencies rolled up their sleeves and did what had to be done.  
  
So for example, we found courts being convened on marae and different agencies, like Work & Income and Inland Revenue working together to provide frontline services to those in need.  
  
That spirit of the public service working more cohesively together is to be encouraged.  
  
And on the policy front, steps are being taken to do just that.  
  
The Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act passed last year for example, provides for greater sharing of information held by Inland Revenue with other government agencies, subject to a range of restrictions.  
  
It makes little sense that a person dealing with a number of different agencies has to provide the same information to each agency.  
  
Sharing information is therefore a rational and efficient way for the public to interact with the public service and especially in Christchurch, anything which facilitates government service delivery is a good thing.  
  
And just on the earthquakes, may I say how gratified I have been at the generous response from people across New Zealand.  
  
Looking at the statistics for Payroll Giving alone, you can see that in March, following the earthquake, we went from 379 employers offering the scheme to 553.  
  
The amounts donated leapt from 160 thousand in February to an astronomical 556 thousand dollars in March.  
  
You may be interested to hear that a recent report has placed New Zealand in second place behind the US for charitable donations.  
  
That is astonishing!  
  
We have always known New Zealand was a big-hearted country but I am still very impressed by this fact.  
  
And the numbers are still growing, so congratulations and my grateful thanks to all of you offering Payroll Giving in your workplaces.

### Payroll Giving

If you are considering offering the scheme in your workplace, I recommend you have a look at the Payroll Giving Early Adopters website at payrollgivinginfo.org.nz  
  
The Payroll Giving Early Adopters Group which comprises a mix of small and large employers has worked very hard to make Payroll Giving more accessible for other employers.  
  
One of the most useful things for employers contemplating offering the scheme is to be able to learn from the experiences of other employers just like themselves.  
  
The site provides useful insights and learnings from employers who have successfully established payroll giving schemes.  
  
Payroll Giving is currently offered by over 1,300 employers with around 107,000 employees having access to a scheme.  
  
Payroll Giving seems to be gaining favour as a convenient way to donate and over $5 million has now been donated through the scheme.  
  
I appreciate that Payroll Giving can mean something extra that people working in payroll are asked to do.  
  
I hope I have shown that it is all part of the greater good.  
  
Similarly other changes to tax laws may mean further work for you, but the result for the nation is great.  
  
Take KiwiSaver for instance.

### KiwiSaver changes

A range of changes were made to KiwiSaver as part of Budget 2011 and in fact, one of the changes, relating to ESCT comes into effect next month.  
  
I do not mean to go over all those changes, but would like to talk to you about the context and the thinking that has gone into the changes and how this is helping our economy.  
  
A problem that we as a nation face is that we just do not save enough.  
  
We need savings to ensure that we all are secure financially in the event of another financial crisis.  
  
We also need savings so that businesses in New Zealand have adequate supplies of capital to draw on for business development and expansion in order to get to the point where we are exporting more than we import.  
  
So it is this expansion which will help us put the recession behind us.  
  
We all know that KiwiSaver has been very effective in attracting new members, but it has done so at a high cost to taxpayers, with the scheme costing the Government over $1 billion a year in subsidies and tax breaks.  
  
To put it plainly, it is not really saving if the Government is borrowing from overseas with one hand to put into an individual’s account with the other because it simply amounts to all taxpayers bearing a greater tax burden to cover the cost of the borrowing.  
  
So reducing Government contributions and increasing private contributions to KiwiSaver will also lift national savings.  
  
It is calculated that these changes to KiwiSaver will save taxpayers $2.6 billion over four years and help lift national savings.  
  
KiwiSaver is good, but to be truly valuable, its future lies in a larger share of contributions coming from members and employers, and Government providing a lower share, but better targeted incentives.  
  
I should also remind you that at the time these changes were introduced in Budget 2011, other changes were also announced, due to come into effect from 1 April 2013:

*   The minimum employee contribution rate will rise from 2 % to 3 %.
*   Compulsory employer contributions will also rise from 2 % to 3 %.

The changes to KiwiSaver, will encourage a higher level of private savings, make the scheme more financially sustainable and build a large pool of local capital.  
  
Total funds are projected to rise from $7.9 billion currently, to about $25 billion by 2015, and almost $60 billion in 10 years.

### Conclusion

I hope I have given you an insight into the thinking that goes into tax policy decision-making.  
  
You have a role in that decision-making as your work in payroll is a crucial cog in the machine of New Zealand’s economy and I look forward to your participation in consultation.  
  
I note that you have a full and interesting programme – I wish you an enjoyable and fruitful conference.  
  
Thank you

Child Support Bill progresses
=============================

The Child Support Amendment Bill first introduced to the House in October 2011, had its First Reading yesterday. See the Minister of Revenue’s [media statement](/news/2012/2012-05-09-child-support-bill-progresses#statement)
 for more information.

* * *

Hon Peter Dunne  
Minister of Revenue

Media statement

### Dunne: Child Support bill big step to fairer scheme

The Child Support Amendment Bill now before Parliament is the culmination of “the most major review of the Child Support scheme since its inception”, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne told Parliament at the Bill’s first reading today.  
  
He said issues of fairness had come to dog the scheme, with around 40 percent of the correspondence he received as Minister relating to child support issues.  
  
“The scheme is long overdue for updating and today it has come a big step closer to becoming fairer for all concerned,” Mr Dunne said.  
  
The bill proposes changes which fall into three categories:

*   a new child support calculation formula that reflects changed social and work realities faced by New Zealand families today
*   secondary changes to update the child support scheme more generally, and
*   amendments to the payment, penalty, and debt rules for child support.

The main change is to the formula used to calculate child support. Mr Dunne said that changing the formula was necessary as it had failed to keep up with changes in society and the reality of life for many families, such as shared parenting and both parents going out to work.

He said the scheme needs to provide a better balance to reflect the needs of children and parents today.

“For instance, there is now a greater expectation that both parents should share responsibility for the financial support and emotional well-being of their children. The child support system should reflect this expectation, whilst also providing better incentives to pay,” Mr Dunne said.

Along with calculating child support more fairly, it is also important to help ensure the stability of child support payments. The Child Support scheme has reached record levels of debt with a large part of the debt made up of penalties. Mr Dunne said that when penalties are seen as insurmountable, they effectively became an obstacle to paying parents meeting their responsibilities.

“For the sake of the children and parents involved, we need a scheme which is both fair and accurate and which helps ensure payments are made on time.

“If paying parents see that we have taken more account of their situations and are applying a more transparent formula then they will see the scheme as fairer and be more likely to comply,” he said.

### Questions and Answers

#### Why is the child support scheme being changed?

The current system was introduced in 1992. Some of the assumptions that underlie the current system, the formula, and the penalties and write-off rules that underpin it are out of date. There is now a greater public expectation that both parents should share responsibility for the financial support and emotional wellbeing of their children. The child support system should reflect this expectation, while also providing effective incentives for parents to pay.

#### How many children are in the child support scheme?

The Government child support scheme helps provide financial support to approximately 210,000 children.

#### What are the changes to the child support formula being proposed?

After receiving over 2,000 submissions during the 2010 public consultation, it was considered that the child support formula should:  
\- be based on more up-to-date estimated expenditures for raising a child;  
\- recognise shared care of a child at lower levels than the current 40 percent of nights test – instead, shared care will be recognised using a tiered system starting at 28 percent of nights; and  
\- take the income of both parents into account, rather than just the paying parent’s income.

#### Why are more up-to-date estimated expenditures being used?

Child support payments should reflect a fair estimate of what it costs to raise a child and what a parent would normally be contributing towards meeting that expenditure if both parents were living together.

#### Why are greater degrees of shared care to be taken into account?

There are concerns that the current shared care rules do not recognise the contributions of some paying parents who have regular and substantial care of their children, but do not satisfy the 40 percent of nights test.

#### Why are the incomes of both parents taken into account?

The current scheme is based on the assumption that the parent who is the primary caregiver will perform this task full-time, and will not be engaged in paid employment. This assumption is less relevant given that women’s workforce participation has risen in recent years. Taking both incomes into account for child support purposes better reflects the financial responsibilities of both parents.

#### What are the other main changes being made to the child support scheme?

These include:  
\- changing the definition of “income” for child support purposes so that it excludes tax losses and includes certain trust income;  
\- making it compulsory for child support payments to be automatically deducted from salary and wages;  
\- changing the late payment penalty rates for child support; and  
\- relaxing the circumstances in which penalties can be written off (for example, when a payment arrangement is entered into).

#### Why is the definition of “income” for child support being changed?

To improve the child support scheme’s integrity and fairness, and to ensure that the definition used better reflects the real income that parents actually have available to them.

#### Why are child support payments to be compulsorily deducted from salary and wages?

Paying parents will have their payments automatically deducted from their salary to ensure that as many child support payments as possible are made, and made on time.

#### Is it fair that all salary and wage earners must have compulsory automatic deductions?

It is recognised that some paying parents will have concerns with this, for example about their employers knowing that they are making child support contributions, however the public interest in operating an effective child support scheme should outweigh these individual concerns.

#### Why are some late penalty rates being reduced?

Although penalties play an important role in encouraging parents to meet their child support obligations, if they are excessive they can discourage the payment of child support. This is to the detriment of the children concerned. Reducing penalty rates in certain circumstances, combined with other effective enforcement measures (such as more intensive case management), will help parents resume making child support payments.

#### Why are changes being made to the penalty write-off rules?

Writing off penalties in certain circumstances – for example, when entering into a payment arrangement with a paying parent – may help facilitate the regular payment of child support. Alternatively, it may be justifiable on certain hardship grounds.  
Is reducing child support payments for some receiving parents fair?

The Government’s concern is about increasing the fairness of the child support system. Although it is recognised that, for some parents, changes to the formula will result in lower amounts being received, any move to a revised formula would be made with the aim of reducing current inequities to ensure the system is more balanced, that paying parents honour their responsibilities to their children and that it is perceived to be fairer overall. It should also be noted that the other (non-formula) changes to the child support scheme are designed to improve child support payment rates, meaning that more receiving parents will receive child support payments than is currently the case.

#### What are the current child support debt figures?

As at 31 March 2012, child support debt assessed and unpaid was $637 million. In addition there are $1,668 million worth of unpaid penalties, giving a combined total child support debt of $2,305 million as at 31 March 2012.

Since the scheme’s introduction in 1992, Inland Revenue has collected over 89.2 percent of all child support payments assessed.

Address to NZ Payroll Practitioners' conference
===============================================

The Minister of Revenue today [addressed](/news/2012/2012-06-21-address-nz-payroll-practitioners-conference#speech)
 the annual conference of the NZ Payroll Practitioners' Association and provided an insight into upcoming work within the tax system.

* * *

Hon Peter Dunne  
Minister of Revenue

Speech

### Keynote Address to NZ Payroll Practitioners’ Association Annual Conference  
Crowne Plaza Hotel, Auckland

Thank you once again for inviting me back to speak to you.  
  
It is always a pleasure to attend your conferences.  
  
Each year as I prepare to attend your conference I think about the various tax initiatives being delivered and how they might affect you, and there are many.  
  
Today, I would like to look forward, to things that will happen and to things that could happen.  
  
I want to talk about upcoming changes to tax rules and about changes to the tax administration as we know it.  
  
The business of collecting tax is not a matter of going out and plundering the citizens for their first-born and their hard-earned cash.  
  
We are not talking about the Sheriff of Nottingham and I want to come back to this question of the role of the department a little later.  
  
The objective is not to collect as much tax as possible, but to collect the fair and correct amount from each taxpayer, and to do it efficiently so as to minimise costs on the taxpayer.   
  
Taxation and the tax system have to be both fair and efficient.  
  
My job, as the Minister of Revenue therefore, is primarily to oversee the development of fair and efficient tax policies which will deliver the necessary revenue to fund government services and support the Government’s objectives for the economy.  
  
A good tax system can and does support economic development.  
  
I think we all know that the Government is committed to a return to surplus in 2014/15.  
  
This is an important goal for New Zealand.   
  
These are uncertain economic times we live in and while we have weathered the Global Financial Crisis, the threat of recession continues to hang over Europe and that will have implications for us if Australia and China, our two biggest trading partners, are adversely affected.   
  
While it has been acceptable in the past to simply borrow money from overseas to fund Government spending, this is no longer palatable and every New Zealander is now far more conscious of the need for saving and prudent spending.   
  
The debt crises various European states that have borrowed far more extensively than we would have ever considered appropriate, and the consequences they now are facing, serves to ram home the point.  
  
Even though large scale is no longer a credible option, we need to continue to maintain a high standard of public services.  
  
The Government’s response is a win-win for taxpayers.   
  
By working through the tax system and steadily eliminating inconsistencies and inequities, we make the tax system fairer and along the way we also collect more of the revenue that should be gathered.

### Budget 2012

Budget 2012 was largely focused on improving fairness in the system.  
  
Tax credits which were outdated and had no clear policy rationale for their continued existence were repealed and the tax credit for the active income for children was replaced with a more targeted approach.  
  
Because the tax credit changes apply from the current tax year (2012/13), transitional rules have been developed to help businesses as they make the necessary adjustment to their systems.   
  
Details of these can be found on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website.   
  
Also repealed was the student loan voluntary repayment bonus.  
  
Like the tax credits, the bonus scheme has been overtaken by events and the Government has since introduced a number of initiatives to increase student loan repayments – and, as last week’s figures showed, these are succeeding.  
  
The bonus was repealed as it did not did not appear to be improving the value of the Student Loan Scheme, and the level of savings from the voluntary repayment bonus was lower than originally estimated.   
  
The objective of the bonus scheme was to encourage faster repayments by borrowers who were slow to repay their student loan, by encouraging them to pay off their loan more quickly and, as a consequence, to reduce the costs to the Government of the Student Loan Scheme.   
  
Yet the take-up of the policy has largely been by individuals who were already paying back their loans quickly, and not by those who were slower to repay their loans.   
  
It therefore made sense to repeal it.  
  
Budget 2012 also signalled the intention of the Government to put the headline change to livestock valuation rules in Budget legislation to prevent farmers who change valuation schemes receiving an unintended tax break.   
  
The detailed legislation will follow later this year dealing with consequential matters.  
  
There are other items also focused on improving fairness which are at different stages of the parliamentary process.

### Upcoming legislation

One of these is the review of the rules relating to the tax treatment of assets used for both earning income and for private use.   
  
It is a principle of our tax system that when you incur costs in earning income, that income can be offset by those costs.   
  
However, costs cannot offset income if they are private in nature.   
  
The fact that an asset is used privately as well as to earn income does not mean that no deduction should be available – but it is not fair that the entire amount should be deductible, either.   
  
Proposals have been through public consultation and I am expecting to introduce the resulting proposed new rules to the House in the next few months.  
  
The usual process for new tax legislation is for all proposals to go through such a public consultation process before legislation is drafted and then introduced to the House.  
  
Another set of proposed new rules due to be introduced to the House later this year will focus on salary or wages traded off for a non-cash benefit which is not taxable under the current tax rules.  
  
An example would be a car park provided on the employer’s premises or a benefit provided to an employee of a charitable organisation.  
  
An issues paper on this was released for public comment in April this year.   
  
This suggested these benefits should be taxable when provided as part of a salary trade-off.  
  
The paper also suggested “salary trade-off” being defined to pick up both explicit and implicit trade-offs.   
  
It would include untaxed benefits when the salary alternative has not been specifically identified or valued, provided the employee had a legally enforceable right to the benefit as part of their contract.  
  
I think that if the tax system is to be fair, then people on equivalent salary packages should be taxed equally, irrespective of how they are paid.   
  
Similar reasoning applies when determining entitlements to social assistance, such as Working for Families.   
  
I expect to introduce legislation in this area to the House late this year, after we have considered officials’ final recommendations in light of submissions on the issues paper.  
  
There is a cost to collecting taxes, and that is a cost borne by the taxpayer.  
  
So one way that the tax system can help the Government meet its goal is by minimising those costs through the efficient collection of taxes. 

### Return filing

Some years ago, 1999, if memory serves me correctly, a big step forward was taken to help simplify tax affairs for most people and at the same time, maintain fairness.   
  
This was the elimination of the requirement for the majority of salary and wage earners to file annual tax returns.  
  
Cast your mind back – many of you here today will remember the old IR 5 tax return.  
  
At a stroke, an onerous tax compliance burden was lifted off the majority of New Zealand’s salary and wage earners.  
  
The system relies on the fact that in some years a person may pay slightly more tax than required while in other years they pay slightly less.   
  
It is swings and roundabouts and in the end it all evens out.  
  
To me, it seems like a very good trade-off for being let off having to do a tax return each year.  
  
And the other advantage is that that the taxpayer no longer bears the cost of Inland Revenue processing millions of tax returns each year.  
  
To my mind, a model of efficiency.  
  
Yet this marvellous advantage is being steadily eroded by people who are selecting individual years in which they know they will get a refund while ignoring the other years in which there is tax to pay.  
  
The net effect therefore is that small refunds are paid out but no corresponding tax to pay is paid.  
  
A bill before the House at the moment contains a measure to try to restore a measure of fairness by proposing that people cherry-picking individual years to file a return should also file returns for the previous four consecutive years as well.  
  
I think that should help to restore the balance.

### Electronic filing

In that same bill there are other proposals which will provide benefits for businesses.  
  
In tax administration, an important way to simplify the system and gain greater efficiency is through greater use of electronic systems.

It is clearly the way to go as companies are increasingly managing their tax obligations through payroll and accounting software as you no doubt are fully aware.

The bill therefore proposes to modernise the record-keeping requirements of businesses by making it easier for taxpayers to store records offshore through applications from their data storage providers and by allowing taxpayers who submit returns electronically to store them electronically and not have to retain paper copies of returns.

This is a simple step, but a significant one which will reduce their record-keeping costs and reduce compliance costs.

All of this is interesting, but to some extent, it is business as usual.

I want to talk now about the future of Inland Revenue because any discussion of electronic filing and efficiency in tax administration must also include mention of Inland Revenue’s own systems.

### Inland Revenue’s business transformation

As you know, Inland Revenue’s technology systems are ageing and the department’s ability to implement complex or major policy change is diminishing over time.

When FIRST was launched way back in 1991, all of Inland Revenue’s communication with taxpayers was on paper and when people spoke about electronic communication, they meant the radio. 

Today FIRST needs to perform tasks undreamt of by its designers, and the reality is that it is a stretch at times.

Inland Revenue now stands at a cross roads.

Partly driven by its technological constraints, changing customer expectations and the economic environment, the department is taking a good hard look at itself.

I said before that IRD is not about going out and grabbing tax.

In my time serving as Revenue Minister for some years now, I have had the opportunity to witness the evolution of the department and come to appreciate more fully New Zealand’s expectations. 

The department is no longer simply a tax administration.

As well as administering taxes, Inland Revenue is now also being called upon to handle KiwiSaver, child support and working for families.

In my view, the department will continue to have those responsibilities.

Inland Revenue now has a central role in customer service as it relates to the public service and this has put further strain on FIRST

Just as in the old days of the IR 5 tax return when Inland Revenue used to be the biggest publisher in New Zealand reaching every taxpayer in the land, today Inland Revenue interacts with more New Zealanders than any other government agency.

So what is the role of the department in the future? 

What constitutes a good tax system?

If the department can accommodate social policy programmes such as KiwiSaver, what else could or should be within its ambit?

I do not know the answer to those questions – they will need to be answered by the department as it scrutinises every aspect of how it does business and those questions will also need to be answered by the public.

So I am inviting you, in the payroll industry to take this very rare opportunity to be part of that discussion. 

It is your opportunity to influence the shape of the organisation – the very DNA of Inland Revenue and indeed of the whole of government for generations to come.

Over the next few years IRD will want to engage with practitioners as it looks for the best way to administer the tax system. 

It will be most likely a time of dramatic change, as we both upgrade our technology to meet today’s challenges and continue to streamline the system to ensure both that outmoded provisions – like the tax credits I spoke of earlier – are eliminated and procedures that hark back to earlier more paper and process driven times are reformed.

I want your voice heard in that discussion.

### Conclusion

Our economic environment and changing customer expectations mean that the tax system needs to continually adapt, but at the same time keep ensuring that the system remains fair and is efficient in gathering taxes.  
  
Exactly how the department works in the future is now being redrawn and you, the people working in payroll, have an opportunity to help shape how the tax department works with you.  
  
I urge you to grasp that opportunity.  
  
I wish you a very enjoyable conference.  
  
Thank you

Address to New Zealand Credit & Finance Institute
=================================================

In his opening [address](/news/2012/2012-07-12-address-new-zealand-credit-finance-institute#speech)
 to the NZ Credit & Finance Institute’s national conference, the Minister of Revenue discussed the role of the tax system in supporting the Government’s objectives for the economy.

* * *

Hon Peter Dunne  
Minister of Revenue

### Address to NZ Credit & Finance Institute  
Crowne Plaza Hotel, Auckland

Good morning.

Your conference programme looks to the future, looking at challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

Looking at the economic environment around us, one could be forgiven for being pessimistic as we contemplate the deepening crisis in Europe, but I want to outline for you why I think we are now poised at a point in New Zealand’s history where our future looks promising.

Of course, there will be challenges along the way – and no doubt some significant ones – but compared to some countries, our challenges are perhaps not as great as those facing some, and I see a great many opportunities ahead for our economy which is built on a solid foundation.

At the outset, it is important to acknowledge that we are in all this together – government, business and the people – and that we each have our particular part to play.

An important contribution the Government can make to help the country weather the economic storm clouds gathering overseas is to get the Government’s finances in order and get debt under control.

Rising debt means greater debt servicing costs, which crowds out more positive expenditure.

It also leaves us vulnerable to moves by credit ratings agencies, which can impose higher economy-wide interest rates.

As Minister of Revenue, I am fundamentally aware of how important a part our tax system is playing in reinforcing our economy.

We accept taxation as the price we pay for the amenities and services of a modern and developed society. 

Our system relies on voluntary compliance and in that, we have a good rate.

Why? 

Because we essentially feel the tax system is fair and know that our taxes pay for the roads we drive on, the hospitals that care for our sick, the police, schools and so on.

We see a good return for our tax dollars and we essentially have a say in how the revenue is spent.

But an efficient and well-functioning tax system is not just the means for collecting revenue for state expenditure; it can also help provide the sort of environment that supports economic growth. 

It has been suggested that Greece’s woes stem from an overly relaxed attitude to debt, imprudent spending and a misguidedly proud tradition of tax evasion.

I read recently that the efforts of a tax collector on the island of Naxos who went looking for tax evaders were thwarted when his car’s licence plate number was broadcast on a local radio station. 

Another, on arriving to conduct an audit was confronted by a whip-wielding Athenian.

Clearly the role of a tax official is not regarded as a noble one in Greece.

However that aside, I think that clear and causal links can be drawn about a community’s attitude towards tax and the strength or otherwise of its economy.

In times of economic adversity, it is necessary to ensure that government revenue is protected because certain government services and functions must continue – preferably without having to borrow to fund them.

Indeed, Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the IMF, has expressed the view that Greece can help lift itself out of its economic woes by simply paying its taxes. 

Acknowledging the truth in this for his own country, the Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti has vowed to hunt down tax evaders.

So maintaining a stable revenue stream is absolutely critical in retaining international confidence.

### Raising revenue fairly

But maintaining such a stream is not simply a matter of gathering as much tax as possible.

To ensure the stability of our revenue stream, rather than the panic-stricken imposition of new taxes or hikes in tax rates, the focus in New Zealand has been on making changes at the margin within our current framework to make it fairer and more efficient.

These themes have been an ongoing feature of our Budgets since the GFC began, if not before, and were well illustrated in this year’s Budget handed down in May.

That Budget included measures that through a combination of better enforcement and collection will collect over a billion dollars in additional revenue over the next five years, without one tax rate being raised. 

And as I say, we have found that for the most part people pay their taxes if they think the system is fair.

Therefore, I believe that we can take some level of satisfaction with our broad based, low rate tax system with its general alignment of tax rates. 

We are aiming for the best possible tax system supported by the best possible tax administration. 

That is a goal that keeps us on track and constantly improving and fine-tuning.

There is more to be done and we will continue to root out inequities in the system as we become aware of them.

### The role of taxation

Because relatively low tax rates and broad bases help minimise economic distortions, a good tax system has an important role in helping New Zealand build a stronger economy and increase productivity. 

If we take account of taxes on both companies and shareholders, New Zealand tax settings are very favourable for retaining and attracting good entrepreneurs and businesses to our shores.

But let us be clear on the role of taxation.

It is what it is. 

It cannot suddenly produce a high income economy.

Suggestions that growth will come from taxing more those who earn and produce most are simply nonsensical. 

What a good tax system can and should do is minimise obstacles to growth.

I am not interested in calls for imposing taxes to influence behavior or provide incentives for business growth.

As Revenue Minister, I can tell you that there are numerous demands of this kind.

Therefore I say that a major challenge ahead is to resist the urge to tamper with the tax system in this way. Now is not the time to experiment with rates and new taxes and it is also not the time to be moving the line on tax avoidance.

I am more focused on making sure we collect the revenue currently due to us through our broad-based, low rate system, before embarking on new taxes, which almost inevitably would fall more harshly on some than others.

Therefore in Budgets 2010 and 2012 the Government committed extra funding to Inland Revenue to bolster its successful tax compliance activities in dealing with the hidden economy, debt collection, and following up on unfiled returns.

The tax system is performing its role well, I believe, in minimising distortion, serving the Government’s revenue requirements and supporting the Government’s objectives.

### Savings

The priority for the Government is moving back into surplus. This will position our economy well to ride out any future economic shocks.

As Minister of Revenue, I also have a particular interest in the role of the tax system in promoting the Government's priorities. 

I believe the tax system can, and is, already doing a great deal to support the Government’s overarching objectives.

One of the key paths forward for an economy righting itself after a period of recession is to reduce the distortionary effects of taxation. 

Tax advantages should not influence investment decisions, thereby skewing investment away from the productive sector.

Another important point is that where national indebtedness is of concern to the economy, then government savings are crucial and of course, this is achieved by the Government earning more than it spends – a fiscal surplus.

Efficient tax collection – within the constraints of fairness – becomes more important.

The tax system therefore is the vehicle for achieving government savings.

Which brings me to a significant challenge that we as a nation face.

As taxes are the lifeblood of government, so savings represent growth and stability for our economy and for individuals. 

We need savings to ensure that we all are secure financially in the event of another financial crisis.

We also need savings so that businesses in New Zealand have adequate supplies of capital to draw on for business development and expansion in order to get to the point where we are exporting more than we import.

It is this expansion which will help us put the recession behind us.

### Investment

At a policy level, the Government is focused on lifting New Zealand's long-run growth rate and reducing the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks.

It will do this by focusing its attention on providing stimulus for better economic outcomes: 

*   responsibly managing the Government's finances
*   building a more competitive and productive economy
*   delivering better public services, and
*   rebuilding Christchurch

There is a strong focus here on investment for the future.

While increasing levels of investment should in general lift our long-run growth rate, it is the quality of investment that matters most.

New Zealanders’ record around investment is not a happy one.

We have invested heavily but poorly, principally in property. 

The tax system has supported this and distortion has resulted.

Over the longer term, part of the Government's economic strategy is to move away from unsustainable reliance on credit.

Until we address that, our economy will continue to be vulnerable.

The Government is concerned that New Zealand places too high a reliance on foreign capital to fund investment and consumption – a reliance that makes New Zealand more vulnerable to foreign shocks. For example:

New Zealand has run a current account deficit every year since 1973. 

National investment has continuously exceeded savings, with the difference funded by offshore borrowing.

There is an increasing net debt to the world. 

One only needs to look at the problems in Europe today to see the risks that can arise from imbalances of this sort.

It is important however to keep things in perspective.

We start out with an internationally low ratio of government debt, meaning that there is no concern about our ability to fund our obligations.

And borrowing from abroad is a good thing if it funds investments that earn more than the cost of that borrowing.

Investment is a positive thing, but where New Zealanders are making investments, we want investment decisions to be driven by the inherent quality of that investment, and not just the manufactured tax advantages that may derive from them.

A fair and efficient tax system creates the right incentives for quality private sector investment.

We have resisted the temptation to reintroduce tax incentives – a path that has proven inefficient and ineffective in the past.

Rather we sought to remove distortion caused by investment in property in Budget 2010.

The concern was that the tax rules might have been encouraging excessive investment in property. 

Lowering income tax rates and removing depreciation deductions were aimed at reducing these biases.

Reduced income tax rates – balanced by an increase in GST – also addressed a key goal of the Budget 2010 – to reduce biases discouraging saving and investment. 

These measures are helping New Zealand to be a great place for people to set up businesses and produce the jobs which make New Zealand an attractive place to live, work, raise a family and have the means to enjoy a comfortable retirement. 

### Retirement savings

On the latter count, a big challenge ahead is superannuation and saving for retirement.

Firstly, and I am speaking here in my other capacity as Associate Minister of Health, I would like to make the point that having an ageing population is by no means a bad thing as various commentators seem to suggest. 

On the contrary. 

One could argue that an ageing population is an indication of the effectiveness of our health system – people are staying well enough to live longer.

From the revenue perspective, as our population ages, we face a future where there are likely to be fewer taxpayers bearing the tax burden of what is being called a silver tsunami. 

That tax burden includes the cost of New Zealand Super itself as well as the rising healthcare costs for an older population.

### NZ Superannuation

Consequently, there is currently much debate about the affordability of NZ Superannuation and the age of entitlement.

The Government remains committed to New Zealand Superannuation, and it will remain a crucial safety net for older New Zealanders.

We fare well against other OECD nations on measures of old age poverty.

New Zealand super is a solid foundation on which further supplements such as KiwiSaver can be added to enhance financial security.

The universal aspect of New Zealand Superannuation means that it does not provide the disincentives for retirees to work and save that are associated with means- and income-tested overseas schemes.

With our ageing population this becomes increasingly important.

An advantage of New Zealand Superannuation is that it enables people to maintain participation in the workforce in their own way and on their own terms, often in a reduced hours or part-time capacity.

Such ongoing workforce participation is often what people want and has benefits other than financial.

It keeps people socially engaged and active.

I look forward to the debate when a discussion document on my party, UnitedFuture’s Flexi-Super policy proposal is released for public consultation probably next year.

This was a key component of our confidence and supply agreement with National, and I have to say it has received a very good reception from both the public and other parties in the political spectrum.

The important point about it is that moves us away from the sterile debate about age limits by passing the choice to the individual to make, based on their savings and their assessments of their circumstances at the time. 

### KiwiSaver 

You may well also have noticed that KiwiSaver has just turned five years old at the beginning of this month, and what a precocious five year old it is!

More than 1,950,000 people have joined it since KiwiSaver was launched on 1 July 2007 and the first 17,500 members – those who joined in their 60s and have now been in KiwiSaver for the full five years – will be eligible to withdraw their funds this month.

New Zealanders have embraced KiwiSaver in numbers and with an enthusiasm far beyond all initial expectations.

In the past five years, $11.8 billion dollars in individual and employer contributions have gone into the funds run by over 30 providers – and that is not counting voluntary contributions members may have also made which have taken the total up to around $12 billion.

The number of members continues to rise, which shows that New Zealanders really see KiwiSaver’s value and how it can play a key part in their future financial security.

However we cannot let this go to our heads.

Yes, KiwiSaver has been very effective in attracting new members, but previously it has done so at a high cost to taxpayers, with the scheme costing the Government over $1 billion a year in subsidies and tax breaks.

To put it plainly, it is not really saving if the Government is borrowing from overseas with one hand to put into an individual’s account with the other.

Doing it that way simply amounts to all taxpayers bearing a greater tax burden to cover the cost of the borrowing.

Budget 2011 put the brakes on this somewhat because reducing Government contributions and increasing private contributions to KiwiSaver will also lift national savings.

It is calculated that these changes to KiwiSaver will save taxpayers $2.6 billion over four years and help lift national savings.

KiwiSaver is good, but to be truly valuable, its future lies in a larger share of contributions coming from members and employers, and Government providing a lower share, but better targeted incentives.

And looking ahead, the inevitable question is, should KiwiSaver be compulsory?

It is a question worth asking with arguments for and against. 

Personally, I have always favoured the idea, and I believe New Zealanders are coming around to it.

Kiwis have an increasingly mature and real view of the big world out there, and how they need to prepare for their future. In 1997 New Zealand categorically rejected a referendum on the issue. 

The rejection was huge – in the vicinity of 93 percent.

Times have changed and I believe the views of New Zealanders have shifted quite substantially in this area.

So the very fact that New Zealand is asking these questions now is a good sign for the future.

I must acknowledge that compulsory KiwiSaver is not, however, Government policy.

But what the wider debate indicates an understanding of the importance of national savings and a willingness to engage in debate on the issue.

So, the question, it seems to me is no longer about whether we save, but how.

Perhaps social historians will record that KiwiSaver’s biggest contribution was to instil a change in thinking about savings among New Zealanders.

On that score it has been phenomenal and that along with New Zealanders’ new-found fiscal prudence are engineering the biggest change in thinking about saving.

For the first time in a generation, New Zealanders are putting money aside and taking steps to live within their means.

This is what gives me great hope for our future.

### Conclusion

In closing, let me say that these are the things which give me heart.

Every economy needs a solid foundation. 

If it is a fair and equitable system, the tax system can contribute to that. 

I believe ours is fair and is contributing to our economy’s solid foundation. 

And my officials continue to work to find ways to improve the system. 

It will continue to be a focus for the Government.

On the crucial question of savings and investment, while New Zealand’s previous track record has not been stellar, we are making great strides. 

We are getting better. 

We are improving.

There is no room for complacency — a lot of work remains to be done, but I am confident we are on the right track. Thank you

### Dunne: new tax bill for fairer tax system, stronger economy

A new tax bill introduced to Parliament today continues the Government’s focus on ensuring everyone pays their fair share of tax, while continuing to support the economy, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said.

The Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure and Remedial Matters) Bill includes supporting provisions proposed to the livestock valuation rules which made elections to use the herd scheme generally irrevocable.

“The situation had previously been too loose, allowing some farmers to switch between the two main livestock valuation methods to receive an unfair tax advantage over those farmers who applied the rules as they were intended,” Mr Dunne said.

The core herd scheme irrevocability rule was enacted as part of Budget 2012 legislation. This bill details the exception to this. The proposed new rules for the disposal of herd scheme livestock are also detailed.

The bill also contains a proposal to tighten the rules for deducting costs of assets such as holiday homes, boats and aircraft that are used by the owner, both privately and to earn income. The proposal was announced in Budget 2012 and has been consulted on publicly.

Mr Dunne said it is a complex matter.

“It is important that the so-called mixed-use rules work properly when the property is held in a company. Achieving this is not straightforward as companies are generally allowed automatic tax deductions for interest expenditure. As a result the bill proposes rules that apportion company interest deductions,” he said.  
  
Mr Dunne said that the bill also had a focus on helping businesses.

“It is important to the Government that New Zealand businesses are supported in becoming more competitive against the rest of the world,” he said.

“Our current GST laws can present an obstacle to that and we need to address this to stay globally competitive. GST is a tax on consumption—not a tax on business and therefore should be neutral for both resident and non-resident businesses.

“The bill proposes to allow non-resident businesses to register for, and claim back, GST in a broadly similar way to a comparable resident business,” Mr Dunne said.

Another GST issue affecting global trade will be resolved in the bill.

Where a New Zealand resident manufacturer charges an overseas customer for the creation or modification of tools required to produce specific exported products, a new rule is proposed that will allow these tooling costs to be zero-rated for GST.

The bill also confirms that farmers’ riparian planting is immediately deductible. Also the rules concerning the tax treatment of certain capital payments and receipts, and capital losses in the horticultural industry, are clarified. These will generally help those kiwifruit orchardists affected by the Psa virus.  
  
In addition, donee status is proposed for three organisations: The Hunger Project New Zealand, OneSight New Zealand, and Fund for Timor.

Excepted financial arrangements
===============================

Media statement

### Dunne: Govt tightens financial arrangements rules  
 

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today that the Government will move swiftly to tighten the rules relating to financial arrangements.  
  
Mr Dunne said the current rules have a loophole that can allow an unfair tax deduction for what are, in real terms, capital amounts.  
  
“The rules allow taxpayers to elect to treat short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services as financial arrangements to minimise compliance costs,” he said.  
  
“However, an unintended consequence has come to light, meaning it is possible to claim a deduction for either the cost of acquiring agreements or any losses on disposal of those agreements by electing financial arrangement treatment.  
  
“It was never the intention of the rules to allow a deduction in this fashion for what is a capital amount,” Mr Dunne said.  
  
The amendment will apply retrospectively from the beginning of the 2008/09 income year, being the date that the current Income Tax Act came into force.  
  
He said that the legislation will be retrospective because of the length of time some financial arrangements can cover and to prevent exploitation of the loophole over the remaining term of an arrangement.  
  
A savings provision will be available for taxpayers who have filed a tax return making an election and taxpayers who have obtained a binding ruling (including a determination) on the tax treatment of financial arrangements under the election rule, before the date of this announcement.  
  
Mr Dunne said it was important for the Government to address this issue.  
  
“Failing to act will leave our tax system vulnerable. At a time when the Government is seeking to reduce national debt, it is more important than ever that we all pay our fair share of tax,” he said.  
  
The amendment will be included in the next available tax bill.  
  
A draft of the proposed legislation is available on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz

### Questions and Answers

#### What will change?

An amendment will be made to the treatment of short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services under the financial arrangements rules.  
  
Where a vendor or purchaser of a short-term agreement for sale and purchase elects to treat the agreement as a financial arrangement, the amount of consideration that will be taken into account for the purposes of spreading or undertaking a base price adjustment will be limited to debts outstanding under the agreement. This will mean that the taxpayer will not be able to claim a deduction under the financial arrangements rules for either the cost of acquiring the agreement or any losses on disposal of the agreement.

#### Why is the change being made?

The current rules allow taxpayers to take advantage of a loophole in the law to obtain a tax deduction for what are in-substance capital amounts. This is because taxpayers can elect to treat a short-term agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services (ordinarily, an excepted financial arrangement) as a financial arrangement.  
  
The result is that it is possible to claim a deduction for either the cost of acquiring such an agreement or any loss on disposal of an agreement by electing financial arrangement treatment. This was never the intention of the rules which were aimed at reducing compliance costs by allowing any short term debt under the agreement to be treated for tax purposes as it is for accounting purposes. The agreement itself should be on capital account.  
  
An example will help to illustrate the problem:  
  
A company acquires the assets of another company, which includes profitable contracts for the provision of certain services. The purchase price for the contracts is $5 million. Electing that the service contracts be financial arrangements and then applying the financial arrangements rules, a tax deduction of $5 million is available to the purchaser over the life of the contracts, resulting in tax savings of $1.4 million. If the contracts were treated as excepted financial arrangements (as conceptually they should be) the general deductibility rules would treat the amounts as capital (non-deductible) expenditure, just as the income to the vendor would be capital and therefore non-assessable.

#### Does the amendment have a fiscal impact?

The amendment will not count fiscally as it is largely a preventative measure. However, officials consider there could be a significant revenue cost if no amendment were made.  
  
There will be a savings provision for taxpayers who have taken a position on the basis of treating a short-term agreement for the sale and purchase of services as a financial arrangement before the date that the change is announced.

#### When will the change apply?

The amendment applies from the start of the 2008-09 income year (which aligns with the date that the current Income Tax Act came into force).  
  
However, there is a saving provision for taxpayers who have filed a tax return making an election and taxpayers who have obtained a binding ruling (including a determination) on the tax treatment of financial arrangements under the election rule, before the date of Ministerial announcement.

#### Why is it necessary for the amendment to apply from a date that is before the announcement of the Government’s decision to amend the law?

There is a high hurdle for tax legislation to be applied retrospectively.  
  
In this particular case, the Government is concerned about the possibility that past transactions might be post-facto re-characterised with a potentially significant fiscal effect. This is because of the length of time that some financial arrangements can cover and to prevent exploitation of that loophole over the remaining term of an arrangement.

### Dunne: lease inducements changes reflect feedback

Lease inducement payments by commercial landlords to tenants will be made taxable, but with some important changes as a result of the recent consultation process, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.  
  
Changes to the initial proposal to tax lease inducement payments include:

*   Responding to concerns about business certainty, the reform will apply to lease inducement payments on commercial leases entered into on or after 1 April 2013.
*   The proposed reform will make lease inducement payments tax deductible by overriding the ‘capital limitation’ on deductions.
*   Income and expenditure arising from these payments will be spread evenly over the term of the lease.

Mr Dunne said that another important change is that the reform will cover other lease-related payments such as lease surrender payments. Lease surrender payments made by tenants to exit a lease early are, at present, generally taxable to the landlord, but non-deductible to the tenant.

As part of a balanced package, lease surrender payments made on or after 1 April 2013 will be made tax deductible to the payer and taxable income to the recipient.  
  
Mr Dunne said this will reduce non-deductible business expenditure, or so-called black hole expenditure.  
  
“This is consistent with the Government’s efforts to reduce black hole expenditure as part of the 2012-13 tax policy work programme,” he said.

Mr Dunne said it was significant that changes had been made in response to the consultation process.  
  
“A key strength of our tax policy process is its emphasis on consultation, which makes for better legislation.  
  
“The reform package will make the tax treatment of lease-related payments fairer and more efficient for businesses, while removing an existing tax advantage that is distorting business decisions on leases,” he said.  
  
The reform package will be included in a tax bill scheduled for introduction later this year, Mr Dunne said.

### Questions and Answers

#### What will change?

The tax treatment of commercial lease-related payments will be changed. Lease-related payments will become taxable income to a recipient and tax deductible expenditure to a payer.  
  
For example, non-taxable/deductible lease inducement payments will be made taxable/deductible. Similarly, taxable/non-deductible lease surrender payments will be made taxable/deductible.  
  
Lease-related payments will be spread evenly over the term of the lease.

#### Why is the change being made?

The current tax treatment of non-taxable/deductible lease inducement payments poses a revenue risk. It creates a tax arbitrage opportunity for taxpayers to substitute taxable rent payments with non-taxable lease inducement payments.  
  
Lease inducement payments are tax advantaged compared to other forms of lease inducements such as a rent-free holiday or a contribution for fit-out costs. This tax advantage therefore distorts business decisions on leases.  
  
The revenue concern has increased following the recent downturn in the commercial property market, when there has been an increase in lease inducement payments. In addition, there has been increasing market promotion, highlighting the tax effectiveness of lease inducement payments.

#### Who will be affected by the change?

Businesses (landlords and tenants) with lease-related payments such as lease inducement or surrender payments will be affected.  
This reform will not affect residential tenants.

#### When will the change apply?

The reform will apply to lease inducement payments on commercial leases entered into on or after 1 April 2013.  
  
The reform will apply to lease surrender payments made on or after 1 April 2013.

#### The initial proposal referred to a 26 July 2012 application date. Why was this suggested in the first place and what is the reason for the change to a 1 April 2013 date?

The 26 July 2012 application date was initially suggested by officials to minimise risks to the tax base. Strong concerns about business certainty regarding the suggested application date were raised during the consultative process.  
  
In response to these concerns, the Government decided on an application date of 1 April 2013. This application date balances business certainty concerns raised during consultation with the revenue risk associated with lease inducement payments.

Hon Peter Dunne  
Minister of Revenue

### Speech

### Keynote Address to NZ Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA) 2012 Tax Conference

Michael Fowler Centre,  
Wellington Friday 26 October 2012

Good morning.

I am delighted to be here with you again, particularly for your twentieth annual conference.  
  
Over the last twenty years some of the country’s top tax experts have come together at this conference to focus on the big issues of the day.  
  
And there is always something new to occupy us in the world of tax.  
  
Let us not forget that the big tax story twenty years ago was that Budget night 1992 introduced the contentious entertainment tax.  
  
It was an event many of us remember well – and probably still bear the battle scars from!  
  
It was at a time when the process by which the government made tax changes was not nearly as well defined or transparent, and I would not be at all surprised if part of the catalyst for the establishment of your annual conference was the number and scale of tax changes, not to mention the capricious and arbitrary nature of some of them.  
  
But looking back over that period, I would say that the tax landscape has had a sense of continuity about it, across successive governments.  
  
Of course each new government has its own aspirations for the country and the economy and the tax system is a means for achieving that, yet despite that, we have had remarkable stability, and I think that your contribution has been a key part of that.  
  
That continuity and stability in the midst of change is what I want to talk to you about today.  
  
And there is change in the wind, at home and abroad.  
  
New Zealand along with the rest of the world is facing large and important fiscal pressures which we need to respond to in a measured way and without a sense of panic.  
  
It should be done by keeping with our broad-based, low-rate tax settings rather than throwing these away.  
  
We also need to keep our tax system well maintained to manage big external influences as well as the many small remedial matters that need to be considered.  
  
I will return to this theme a little later.  
  
But perhaps the area generating the most change on the immediate horizon and stretching away for some years is Inland Revenue’s business transformation.

### Inland Revenue’s business transformation

As you know, Inland Revenue is transforming its business to provide better value for money across the vast range of activities it performs and in line with Government’s expectations for the public service.  
  
Another milestone event twenty years ago for the tax system was the advent of Inland Revenue’s computer system, FIRST.

For its time, FIRST was ground-breaking and it still continues to do good service.  
  
However, it has become increasingly apparent that the system has become a significant challenge to the efficiency and effectiveness of our tax administration.  
  
Since the advent of FIRST, various policy initiatives like Child Support, Student Loans, Working for Families and KiwiSaver, have become part of Inland Revenue’s core business, and inevitably have placed their own pressures on the system.  
  
At the same time, taxpayers, both corporate and personal, have been calling for a more interactive system to enable them to better manage their tax affairs on-line, a little like the way we do our banking these days.  
  
Let me be clear – while FIRST is under pressure, it is likely to remain a core part of Inland Revenue’s architecture for some time to come.  
  
Those, like for example the Parliamentary Opposition, who allege the whole system is in danger of imminent collapse, and that we are doing nothing about it are as irresponsible as they are plain ignorant.  
  
The briefing paper I received after the 2011 election made it clear that it was now timely to consider afresh the future role and function of Inland Revenue, given that its role now extended far beyond that of just a traditional tax collector.  
  
Inland Revenue today is the government agency most New Zealanders have most dealings with, and is responsible for raising around 77% of the government’s revenue.  
  
So, while modern technology is obviously an important part of Inland Revenue’s future, the issues we are considering go far beyond a simple replacement of our current technology.

In order to continue to raise the revenue and disburse benefits in the future, Inland Revenue also needs to examine its business processes alongside its modern role.

The Department will need to have processes that lower compliance costs and make it easy for customers to deal with them, and will also need to be able to work across government.  
  
As it transforms itself, Inland Revenue will have a particular role to play in two of the PM’s ten result areas for the public service by reducing the compliance burden on business and supporting the transition of government services to the digital environment.  
  
None of this can be achieved quickly or easily – as recent information technology experiences demonstrate.  
  
In passing, I find it more pathetic than amusing that our critics can on the one hand berate MSD for allegedly not consulting widely enough in the development of its IT systems, and then in the next breath attack Inland Revenue for its steady and thorough approach, involving the judicious use of consultants from New Zealand and abroad.  
  
My commitment is simple: I want the best outcome, the best system, and the best advice to achieve the best outcome, and I make no apology for that.

More generally, taxpayers, tax professionals, the general public and Ministers need to consider what New Zealand requires of a good tax system.

My view is that Inland Revenue needs a focus on supporting business and to continue to focus on providing value for money.

I would emphasise the focus on “value” as well as “money” because reducing unnecessary contacts with the Department and making them as low cost as is possible for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue, while highly desirable, will also mean moving staff from lower value tasks to higher value tasks.

There are undoubtedly a range of improvements that can be made to Inland Revenue’s processes and systems.  
  
An example would be to improve the PAYE system, with a particular focus on the Employer Monthly Schedule.  
  
This schedule provided to Inland Revenue by all employers is a key payment and data collection mechanism within the overall tax system.  
  
We rely on it for collecting 39% of Government tax revenue and Inland Revenue also relies on it for vital information.  
  
So it performs a hugely important function, yet it is inflexible and cannot accommodate changes.  
  
And I would hazard a guess that many employers view it as an irksome chore.  
  
A fundamental issue with it is that it is labour-intensive, thus making it a significant burden on employers.  
  
To avoid repeat contacts from Inland Revenue and double-handling, we really need a system which allows accurate, validated information from employers at the first interaction providing near real time confirmation and improved status reporting.  
  
Such a system would also enhance information sharing across government, unlocking further efficiencies in the public service.  
  
But I think that what would be most helpful for employers would be if such a system were integrated as part of the employer’s everyday business system – simple, seamless, no fuss or bother.  
  
Having features such as these would mean that employers would reduce the amount of time they spend on PAYE obligations and time spent interacting with IRD.  
  
Over the next few years, it is my expectation that IRD will want significant engagement with practitioners to find the best way to administer the tax system.  
  
It is an exciting time for the department and the tax community and will be your opportunity to influence the shape of the organisation and indeed of the whole of government for generations to come.  
  
I encourage you to take up that challenge, and to become involved with us in the process of change.

Now all of that is a big change programme for Inland Revenue.  
  
Over the next few months, the Government will be considering all these issues and making a series of major decisions.  
  
They will be big and far-reaching, but the challenge will be for Inland Revenue to be able to pull this off while still performing the core tasks required of it and delivering the Government’s tax policy work programme.  
  
Those who seek a silver bullet, single bold solution will be as disappointed as they are out of touch.  
  
We are talking about the face of Inland Revenue, and beyond that the wider face of government integration with its citizens, for probably the next 20 years or so.  
  
This transformation will be thorough, staged, and wide-ranging, and will ensure at the same time that Inland Revenue will continue to be able to carry out its core functions in a way the New Zealand public would expect.  
  
That is the continuity in the face of change that I was referring to.  
  
Important ongoing functions that I, as Revenue Minister require of Inland Revenue are the development and implementation of the tax policy work programme and the annual Budget.

### Budget 2013

Officials are turning their minds to Budget 2013 proposals at the moment and their thinking is set firmly in the context of the need for careful fiscal management.

Twenty years ago, New Zealand had reached an unenviable achievement.

New Zealand’s net government debt had risen steadily from the early 1970s and in 1992 peaked at over 50 per cent of GDP.  
  
It then took another 16 years of near continuous economic growth and careful fiscal management to get it down and almost eliminate it by 2008.  
  
We all know what happened next.  
  
The twin body blows of the Global Financial Crisis and the Christchurch earthquakes have been a setback, but the Government has been working strenuously to wrestle that debt back under control.  
  
If there is one thing that the Global Financial Crisis has taught us, it is that we urgently need to protect our economy from overseas economic turmoil.  
  
To assist with returning to surplus, we need to maintain robust taxes in order to raise the revenue we need to fund Government services and functions.  
  
But we will do it in ways that are as fair and efficient as possible and that means that we apply existing tax bases more broadly to reduce distortions to investment and increase fairness so that the tax burden is spread more evenly.  
  
This year’s Budget tax announcements inspired some to accuse the Government of scraping the bottom of the barrel, casting around desperately for any dollar we could.  
  
While that is a colourful description, it is simply missing the point entirely.  
  
If the objective was to raise as much revenue as possible, we could do that very easily by raising rates or imposing new taxes, whereas the Budget decisions were about tidying up the system and removing outdated some tax credits.  
  
Even as we speak, some EU countries are lining up to support the introduction of a financial transactions tax, and there is a sad but predictable chorus here calling for similar moves.  
  
That is not the road for New Zealand.  
  
Nor is the path of higher personal taxes and capital gains taxes.  
  
Taxes that were dumb to introduce in the past are likely to still be dumb to introduce in the future.  
  
We are not in the business of rushing about applying quick-fix measures every time a new crisis arises.  
  
What we are doing is ensuring careful management of the Government’s finances and the tax system.

I am not making Budget announcements today – we are not yet at that point, but I can tell you that in line with successive Budgets and recent tax changes we will continue to make the system fairer and more efficient.

I have encouraged officials to continue seeking out further improvements to the system and any changes proposed will in due course be consulted on in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process.

It is also an important part of business transformation – modernising the various taxes we impose sits very comfortably alongside modernising the way we do our business, and so it should.

### GTPP

The Government cannot design tax changes in isolation and I believe the Generic Tax Policy Process has been hugely influential in raising the quality of tax policy reforms in New Zealand.

Since its inception, which followed some of the dark days that I spoke of earlier, tax officials and tax practitioners have been building a strong working relationship which, it seems to me, has been highly beneficial for New Zealand, producing tax policy all the better for the consultation between officials and practitioners.

There will of course always be differences of opinion on policy proposals, such as the matter of retrospectivity.

### Retrospectivity

Let me first assure you that in developing policy, retrospective application dates are not the norm.

Instead, the Government can propose tax law changes that apply for example, from the date of announcement in limited circumstances when:

*   A significant risk to the tax base exists, or when
*   The coherence of the tax legislation requires it, for example, fixing an obvious error or clearly unintended gap.

These exceptions are recognised under the generic tax policy process.

At the same time, I completely accept that these circumstances must be balanced against the need for business certainty.

The way forward from this point for policy development is consultation in order to test out proposals and adjust where necessary based on feedback.

As a result of consultation, details of the original proposals are often changed.

A good example of this is the proposed tax treatment of assets used both privately and for earning income.

### Mixed use assets

The central issue with mixed-use assets is one of apportionment and how to treat the time when an asset lies idle and theoretically available for private or business use.

It has always been the case that assets used privately do not qualify for a tax deduction, while those used in earning income can be eligible for a deduction.

That is a principle of our tax system.

Presently the general apportionment proposition for a mixed use asset is that the asset was acquired primarily for business purposes, so non-use is business use and therefore deductible.

This seemed unfair and a proposed solution considered by officials was to treat non-use as private.

However after policy development and consultation, Government has decided that the apportionment should be based on a comparison of private use to business use.

In other words, the Government has chosen a reasonably generous approach.

A trade-off for this more generous approach is that the proposed rules are more complex.

A complicating factor arises when the property is held in a company as companies are generally allowed an automatic tax deduction for interest expenditure.

As a result the bill proposes rules that apportion company interest deductions potentially across both companies and their shareholders, which adds a level of complexity.

The new rules have been included in the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill which is currently before the House.

If you choose to make submissions on the proposed rules, I urge you to do so as the bill goes through the select committee process.

Meanwhile, change is also occurring beyond our borders which we need to contend with.

### FATCA

You may be aware of the US requirements arising out of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.

To combat tax evasion, the Act (known as FATCA) requires financial institutions internationally to provide details relating to US citizens’ accounts to the IRS.

That is fine for the United States, but FATCA’s waves wash widely, and could have profound implications for a number of New Zealand financial institutions.

So to reduce the compliance cost for New Zealand financial institutions, the Government will seek to negotiate an Inter-Governmental Agreement with the US.

This would see our financial institutions providing the information to Inland Revenue which would exchange the information with the IRS.

This also removes risks around financial institutions being in breach of domestic law.

At the same time there has been important work to ensure that the tax system is maintained and that tax settings work well for New Zealand with its highly mobile labour force and capital stock which brings me to the issue of mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits with Australia.

### Mutual Recognition

Mutual recognition has been an issue for quite some time and is one of the issues currently being examined by the Productivity Commissions of Australia and New Zealand.  
  
The Productivity Commissions have noted that the absence of mutual recognition was of great concern to a number of business participants but that the matter required further assessment.  
  
Consequently, the Productivity Commissions are examining mutual recognition further ahead of the release of their final report, which is due to be submitted to respective Governments by 1 December 2012.  
  
Tax officials have been closely engaged with that process and the Government remains committed to pursuing mutual recognition.

### Rewrite Advisory Panel

There is one other significant item that I would like to mention about consultation.

We often focus on “big splash” tax reforms.

But a good tax system also needs on-going systematic maintenance, and tax bills introduced into the House routinely carry a large proportion of small remedial items.

Consultation on these items tends to be narrower than for the big splash items.

Because of their importance to the health of the system, I have asked the Chair of the Rewrite Advisory Panel to take remedial items into their ambit as a cohesive body of work and to act as an additional consultative body.

The panel will provide consultation to Inland Revenue on remedial matters on the tax policy work programme under a process consistent with the generic tax policy process.

It will assist with identifying and setting the priority of remedial items and provide input into policy analysis and recommendations.

There are major benefits to be gained for the tax system through this approach.

### Conclusion

I said at the outset that much has changed over the last twenty years.  
  
On the whole those changes have been for the good.  
  
Our system is more robust, and the quality of our policy-making is better.  
  
But change is never static.  
  
If what we did after 1992 was radical by the standards of what had gone before, the changes we are now contemplating are even more dramatic.  
  
Inland Revenue is preparing to embark on a profound programme of change that will create challenges but also opportunities for an improved tax system over the next ten years.  
  
But in the face of all this change, we cannot stand still.  
  
We need to make sure that the tax system provides a fair, efficient and robust base for raising the revenue the Government needs to finance its spending and keep debt under control.  
  
I hope that the good working relationship forged between your organisation and the IRD will help both organisations drive big improvements to the tax system through this period.  
  
Once again, I thank you for the important contribution you make by taking part in the consultative process.

I wish you a very successful conference.  
  
Ends.

### Government seeks feedback on mining reviews 

The Government is calling for public feedback on proposed changes to royalties and the taxation of minerals.   
  
Two papers – _Reviewing the Royalties Regime for Minerals_ and _Taxation of Specified Mineral Mining_ – have now been released for public consultation. The royalties paper sets out proposals related to Government revenue from minerals, not oil and gas. The tax paper also excludes oil and gas from its proposals, as well as coal.  
  
“Minerals are important to New Zealand’s economy,” Mr Heatley said.  
  
“New Zealanders are generally comfortable with mining so long as it’s done safely and responsibly, with a strong regulatory framework.   
  
“And they know that the royalties and taxes the Crown gets from mining companies pay for hospitals, school and roads. There is real potential for that contribution to grow,” he said.  
  
The royalties review recommends higher royalty rates for large and highly profitable mining operations. However, the new rates would only apply to new permits – existing permits and licences would retain the royalty rate that currently applies.  
  
“The suggested rates in the royalty review would ensure that New Zealand receives a fair financial return from future development of its mineral estate, while keeping New Zealand’s royalty rates internationally competitive, particularly when compared to Australia,” Mr Heatley said.   
  
Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said it was also important that mining companies paid an appropriate level of tax.   
  
The taxation paper suggests more closely aligning the current concessionary tax regime for certain minerals with general tax principles that apply to other forms of investment.   
  
Specifically, the review suggests removing immediate tax deductions, or in some cases tax deductions in advance, for expenditure that would normally be capitalised and depreciated over the useful life of the asset.  
  
“This approach is in line with the Government’s continuing focus on ensuring that everyone pays their fair share of tax,” Mr Dunne said.  
  
“The mining sector is important but we must ensure that the tax rules do not give the sector an unfair advantage over other investments which may have higher pre-tax rates of return.”  
  
The _Reviewing the Royalties Regime for Minerals_ paper focuses on the royalty rates applied to coal, gold, silver, platinum group elements, ironsands, phosphates and seafloor massive sulphides.   
  
The _Taxation of Specified Mineral Mining_ focuses on the tax rules that apply to miners of specified minerals, including gold, silver and ironsands.   
  
Both sets of proposals aim to enhance economic efficiency by ensuring that scarce resources are directed to economic activities that provide the highest returns before the imposition of tax and royalties.  
  
Submissions on the proposals close on December 7.

Taxing multinational companies
==============================

The Minister of Revenue issued a media statement today explaining some of the issues relating to taxing large multinational companies. For more information, please see the [media statement](/news/2012/2012-12-04-taxing-multinational-companies#statement)

### Dunne explains NZ’s tax approach to multinationals

Tax systems around the world are adjusting to corporate giants with huge internet footprints, but very little physical presence, Revenue Minister Peter said today in addressing issues around the tax treatment of large multinational companies.

“The reality is that tax regimes internationally have generally been developed for an industrial age, and have struggled to keep pace with new business models and technologies not contained by location or national borders,” Mr Dunne said.

“That is the challenge that we face in New Zealand, but it is very much a global issue faced by other nations too. The problem is not just that these large companies are not paying substantial tax here, but that they tend not to be paying substantial tax anywhere.

“We see Britain and Australia facing exactly the same issues, and our rules are already very similar to those adopted by Australia last week,” he said.

Mr Dunne said the answer to taxing multinationals appropriately in various jurisdictions would be found through international projects and agreements, and that New Zealand is involved in these talks, particularly through the OECD.

“A key issue is that foreign companies are taxed on the activities that they actually perform in New Zealand, so under international norms, New Zealand, like any other OECD nation, may have no right to tax profits from revenues generated from New Zealand.”

“Again, for cross-border transactions, the New Zealand tax system, like those of tax jurisdictions around the world, focuses on a physical presence and taxable activity occurring here,” Mr Dunne said.

“However, the internet has made it possible to provide an increasing range of services to distant customers from anywhere in the world. This means that overseas-based internet companies have a very limited physical presence in most countries in which they operate – including New Zealand.

“Since the bulk of what these companies do, in terms of programming, designing websites, running servers, selling advertising, is done overseas, New Zealand, like other countries, may have very limited taxing rights.

Mr Dunne said concerns that such multinationals are not paying appropriate levels of tax need to be balanced against those complex realities.

“There are no easy answers or quick fixes here, but there are definitely fundamental issues that need to be tackled to get a fairer system,” he said.

“This is, as I say, a global problem requiring a global response and New Zealand will be involved in working up that response,” he said.

He said New Zealand participates closely in the OECD project on profit shifting by multinationals and the global erosion of the corporate tax base.

“Part of the OECD’s work will focus on how tax structures such as the double Irish technique may be used to minimise the tax which is payable in Ireland and other foreign countries.

“We are also closely involved with related initiatives such as the systematic reviews of country regimes being undertaken by the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes and the OECD’s Forum on Harmful Tax Practices.

“I can assure you that any activities multinational businesses, or their New Zealand subsidiaries, perform in this country will be taxed appropriately,” he said.

Mr Dunne said on the international front measures such as transfer pricing, thin capitalisation, and general anti-avoidance rules are already in place to make sure international firms pay an appropriate level of tax in New Zealand.

“We also have a growing network of tax treaties to help stamp out tax avoidance through information sharing with other countries.”

As part of Budget 2010, the Government took steps to stop foreign multinationals from reducing their New Zealand profits through debt funding by tightening the thin capitalisation ratio from 75% to 60%. The Government’s tax policy work programme includes a project to ensure that certain investment structures cannot be used to escape the application of these rules.

Mr Dunne has requested a report from Inland Revenue into the tax treatment of such companies.

“Our tax laws need to evolve and they will. This is a challenge, and it is about fairness, and it will be met.”

### Dunne: Govt to simplify financial arrangements rules

The Government will move to simplify the rules relating to financial arrangements that are agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

Mr Dunne said the changes reflect concerns expressed by a number of business taxpayers and their representatives over the past few years.

“The proposed changes will have a beneficial impact on business taxpayers who sell or buy property or services. They will be particularly welcomed by businesses who export and import capital equipment,” he said.

Taxpayers who prepare financial reports using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) will now follow their accounting treatment for taxation purposes for almost all of these arrangements. The exception will be capital account transactions other than depreciable property. Other taxpayers will use simplified rules that will give similar results.

The amendments will apply from the 2013/14 income year. However the legislation will allow IFRS taxpayers to elect to apply the accounting treatment to new arrangements from the 2011/12 income year.

The changes will also validate the past treatment of arrangements which have effectively used methods allowed under the new rules.

Mr Dunne said that simplifying the rules was consistent with the Government’s objective of making it easier for customers to interact with government.

“The rule changes will mean lower compliance costs, increased technical compliance and for some, less volatility of taxable income from year-to-year,” he said.

The amendments will be included in the next available tax bill, with draft legislation expected to be released for comment in March 2013.

More technical details on the proposed rules and their application can be found in a fact sheet at [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](/news/2012/2012-12-14-proposed-changes-financial-arrangements-rules#factsheet)

### Financial arrangements for the sale and purchase of property or services

Fact sheet

#### Introduction

Business taxpayers have made submissions to Inland Revenue concerning the complexity of the taxation rules regarding financial arrangements where they are agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services.

Put simply, the complexity of the rules is now inappropriate.

#### Detail

The advent of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) provides an opportunity to simplify the rules.

It will be mandatory for IFRS taxpayers to follow their financial reporting treatment for almost all of their agreements for the sale and purchase of goods and services.

The exception will be agreements for capital items, other than capital items that are depreciable. Non-depreciable capital items will be dealt with at spot, and any hedging of these non-capital items will be treated separately as usual.

Non-IFRS taxpayers will use a simplified version of the IFRS treatments.

The Issues Paper released in July 2012 originally proposed that the new rules be made effective for new arrangements from the 2012-13 income year, with a choice for taxpayers to apply them in the 2011-12 income year. However, based on a number of submissions that officials received, it is now proposed that the new rules apply for the 2013-14 income year. It is considered that this will be the least disruptive application date for the majority of taxpayers, and will not impact on provisional tax payments for current income years.

However, it is proposed that IFRS taxpayers can make a once-and-for-all election to apply the IFRS accounting treatment to new arrangements from the 2011-12 income year. This would include any designated hedges, the cost of the underlying item and any interest component.

It is also proposed that the tax treatment for any existing arrangements, associated hedges and the underlying property or services for income years before IFRS taxpayers adopt the IFRS tax treatment, or the 2013-14 income year for non-IFRS taxpayers, be validated as follows:

*   The proposed IFRS accounting treatment (as outlined above) has been followed for tax purposes. This includes the treatment of any designated financial arrangements which hedge FX risk on the arrangements; any interest involved; the calculation of the tax book value of the resultant “underlying” property or services; and the determination of the “rights” date (the time when the property or services are recognised for accounting and tax).
*   The tax treatment of the arrangements in foreign currency and the valuation of the underlying property or services in those arrangements have used spot exchange rates at payment and/or rights dates.
*   The tax treatment of the arrangements was otherwise based on the new rules applying from the 2013-14 income year.

Existing agreements will continue to use the tax treatment applied before IFRS taxpayers adopt the IFRS treatment for new arrangements, or the 2013-14 income year, until they mature – that is, the tax treatment of existing arrangements will not be allowed to change to another current or new alternative method. However, IFRS taxpayers will be able to elect that forward exchange contracts (FECs) entered into from the 2013-14 income year (or the 2011-12 income year if they elect as above) that are designated as hedges of the foreign exchange risks on existing arrangements can follow the IFRS accounting treatment for tax. This election will have to be adopted for all new FECs which are designated as hedges of existing arrangements from that income year. The calculation of the resultant “underlying” property or services for these arrangements for tax will include any amounts for FECs subject to the election.

#### Legislation

It is intended that draft legislation will be included in a tax bill early in 2013. about the draft legislation is expected to be made available for comment in March 2013.

Officials’ report released
==========================

A report examining issues relating to taxing large multinational companies prepared by Treasury and IRD officials was released today by the Minister of Revenue, Peter Dunne. For more information, please see the Minister’s [media statement](/news/2012/2012-12-19-officials-report-released#statement)

### Dunne: NZ in global push for multinationals to pay fair tax share

New Zealand is on the right track on the issue of taxing large multinationals and is committed to working with the OECD and co-ordinating closely with Australia, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today in releasing an officials’ report on the issue.  
  
“It is a problem facing many countries, but no one country can solve it alone. It is a global issue and it will have a global solution, and New Zealand is constructively working on being part of that solution,” Mr Dunne said.  
  
He said New Zealand will have a representative at the OECD’s Committee of Fiscal Affairs meeting in Paris next month, where taxing multinationals will be an important agenda item.  
  
“There is no doubt that more needs to be done, but I am satisfied that we are on the right track.”  
  
The Inland Revenue and Treasury report examines concerns that large multinationals are paying little or no tax in the countries they operate in, such as New Zealand, as well as in their home countries.  
  
Mr Dunne called for the report earlier this month.  
  
“There is growing international outrage over this issue. People are offended that these large companies are often not paying any tax anywhere at all.  
  
“The global community is saying this is not good enough and we are going to do something about it,” he said.  
  
The report says that the issue can only be dealt with effectively as part of a global effort with other OECD nations. It also indicates areas within New Zealand’s domestic tax laws which may be further strengthened to protect the tax base.  
  
“And we are already working on addressing those issues, and there will be proposals put out for consultation early in the new year,” Mr Dunne said.  
  
He said the issue was in a highly complex area of tax law, and made more difficult by the need for international co-operation.  
  
“Tax regimes around the world have largely been developed for an industrial age, and have had trouble keeping up with new business models and technologies in the internet age where companies are not contained by location or national borders,” Mr Dunne said.  
  
“That is the shared challenge New Zealand and a lot of other nations face today.  
  
“The problem is not just that these large companies are not paying substantial tax here, but that they tend not to be paying substantial tax anywhere.  
  
Mr Dunne said that in the last quarter New Zealand has committed to negotiating a FATCA agreement with the US Government; signed the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters; and expanded its network of double-tax agreements.  
  
“With the recent signing of the new agreement with Papua New Guinea, New Zealand now has 38 double tax agreements for exchanging information,” he said.  
  
“Step by considered step, we are closing the gaps, and will continue to do so with the international community, so large multinationals will pay their fair share of tax,” he said.  
  
The full report is available at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz  
  
Mr Dunne said that he was aware that people would have views on the matter and that he had instructed officials to keep him updated on the issue. He has also asked officials to take opportunities to engage with interested parties in the new year.  
  
Mr Dunne said people are welcome to submit comments on the report to Inland Revenue at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

Hon Peter Dunne Minister of Revenue 24 May 2012 Budget changes raise revenue, increase fairness The Government is taking a number of steps to tighten the tax system by closing loopholes and updating the tax credit system, which will generate hundreds of millions of dollars of extra revenue over the next four years. “This continues the Government‟s work over the previous three Budgets to protect its revenue base and ensure the tax system is fairer for all taxpayers,” Revenue Minister Peter Dunne says. The changes include:  Tightening the rules around the deductibility of costs relating to assets that are both used by their owners and rented out for income, such as holiday homes, boats, and aircraft. The changes are expected to save about $109 million over the next four years.  Putting changes to livestock valuation rules into Budget legislation to prevent farmers who change valuation schemes receiving an unintended tax break. The changes will reverse what would otherwise have been an estimated $184 million fall in operating revenue over the next four years.  Removing three tax credits which no longer fit the purpose for which they were set up – the income-under-$9,880 tax credit, the childcare and housekeeper tax credit, and the tax credit for the active income of children, which will be replaced by a limited exemption. The changes will save $117 million over the next four years. “These changes will help modernise the tax system and ensure tax deductions and tax credits are being targeted to areas where they are intended and needed,” Mr Dunne says. “In the case of mixed-use assets, such as a holiday home, it is unfair that owners can claim a tax deduction for the majority of their costs because it is available for rent or hire, even if it is mainly used privately. In effect, they are getting a taxpayer subsidy for their private use of the asset.” The new rules will require mixed-use asset owners to apportion their deductions based on the actual income earned and private use of the asset. For example, owners who rent out their holiday home for 30 days in a year and use it themselves for 30 days in a year will be able to claim a deduction for 50 per cent of their general costs, rather than the 90 per cent they can claim now. “In the case of livestock valuations, the previous rules were too loose and allowed some farmers switching between the two main livestock valuation methods to receive an unfair tax advantage over those farmers who applied the rules as they were intended,” Mr Dunne says. In March, the Government announced it would disallow them to move from the „herd scheme‟ to the alternative „national standard cost scheme‟, except in narrow circumstances, effective from 18 August 2011. Budget legislation will put that into law. Details will be included in the next omnibus tax bill. “The three tax credits we are removing in Budget 2012 have become poorly targeted. For example, the bottom 30 per cent of households make up just 11 per cent of childcare and housekeeper tax credit claimants,” Mr Dunne says. “Their use, in most cases, is now quite different from what was originally intended. For example, the income-under-$9,880 tax credit was originally put in place in 1986 to protect full-time workers on low wages, but it no longer applies to that group. “The childcare and housekeeper tax credit has been superseded in recent years by other government support, such as Working for Families and 20 hours free early childhood education. “Times have changed, society has changed, and wider government policies have changed. The Government believes its spending on these tax credits could be better directed to areas of higher need.” The tax credit for children will be replaced by a limited tax exemption to ensure that children will not need to file a tax return if they earn small amounts of „in the hand‟ income that would not usually be taxed at source – for example, from babysitting or mowing the neighbour‟s lawn. However, children will no longer be able to claim a refund of tax that has already been correctly deducted and paid by an employer. These changes will take effect from the 2012/13 tax year. People filing their 2011/12 tax returns can still claim these credits. “These tax credit changes will also help make Inland Revenue more efficient. A lot of people are filing tax returns simply to claim these outdated tax credits. “The changes will free up some of Inland Revenue‟s resources, allowing it to focus on delivering the services New Zealanders want in the future,” Mr Dunne says.

Policy Advice Division factsheet May 2012 1 taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz Budget 2012 proposed tax credit changes — transitional rules and the proposed tax exemption for children Changes to three tax credits – the income under $9,880 tax credit, the tax credit for childcare and housekeeper expenditure, and the tax credit for the active income of children – have been proposed as part of Budget 2012. The proposed changes would see the tax credit for the active income of children replaced with a limited tax exemption. This exemption would mean that a school child would not need to declare untaxed income of less than $2,340. The exemption would not apply to salary or wages, or other income on which tax has already been paid. The income under $9,880 tax credit and the tax credit for childcare and housekeeper expenditure are proposed to be repealed. Taxpayers would not be able to claim these credits if they file a tax return at the end of the tax year. These proposed changes would have effect from the 2012/13 tax year. Taxpayers can still make claims for the year ending 31 March 2012 (the 2011/12 year). Transitional rules Two of the tax credits, the income under $9,880 tax credit and the tax credit for the active income of children, can be claimed during the year through the PAYE system. For the income under $9,880 credit, this is done by an employee informing their employer of an “ML” or “ML SL” tax code. For the credit for the active income of children, employers can choose to not deduct PAYE from school children employees who are expected to have a total annual income of less than $2,340. Because the tax credit changes apply from the current tax year (2012/13), proposed transitional rules have been announced. Under the proposed rules, an employee on an “ML” or “ML SL” tax code can continue to use that code up until 31 March 2013. After that they will have to use another tax code, such as “M” or “M SL”. For a school child earning less than $2,340, employers would not be required to deduct PAYE from their pay until 31 March 2013. These transitional arrangements would mean people on an “ML” or “ML SL” tax code, or children who have not had PAYE deducted, may be able to keep the benefit of these tax credits in the 2012-13 tax year despite their repeal. There would be no requirement for these people to file a tax return or request a personal tax summary solely for having received the credits during the year; however, if they do file a return or request a summary they may be assessed as having tax to pay. Policy Advice Division factsheet May 2012 2 taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz Many people in this situation will not be required to file a return or request a summary at all. Details of the proposed new tax exemption for children The proposed new tax exemption has the same eligibility criteria as the tax credit for children. That is, it is available to people who: • are 14 or under, or • are 15, 16 or 17 and still attending school\*, or • turned 18 on or after 1 January in the previous tax year and continued to attend school\*. \* including schools for people with disabilities, but excluding tertiary institutions. The exemption would mean that children would not need to pay tax on up to $2,340 of income which is not taxed at source (such as money for mowing the neighbours’ lawns). The exemption would not apply to income on which tax has already been paid, such as salary and wages or interest. If a child earned more than $2,340 from income which is not taxed at source, the proposed exemption would not apply to any of the income. The child would have to pay tax on the full amount. Example of the proposed exemption Kate is at secondary school and has a part time job at the local retail store earning about $2,000 a year. Her employer deducts PAYE from her wages each week. Kate also gets paid for the occasional babysitter job for neighbours. She makes around $300 a year from babysitting. She also earns $50 in interest on her savings for which Resident Withholding Tax (RWT) is deducted. Under the previous tax credit for a child’s active income, Kate could file a tax return to claim back her PAYE, but not her RWT. The tax credit would also offset the tax payable on her babysitting income. With the new child’s income tax exemption, Kate would not be required to file and pay tax on the babysitting income. She would not be able to claim back the PAYE or RWT.

This Budget 2012 legislation followed the release of the officials’ issues paper, Herd scheme elections, on 18 August 2011 and the subsequent consultation. There are generally two ways that farmers can value their livestock (mainly beef and dairy cattle, and sheep (but also deer, goats and pigs)), at balance date for tax purposes. The herd scheme treats livestock more as if they were a capital asset by using national average market values (commonly called “herd values”) with changes in values from year to year on tax-free capital account. National standard cost or NSC is similar to a typical trading stock scheme where changes in values from year to year are on tax account. The major difference from a standard trading stock scheme is that on-farm costs for breeding, rearing and growing home-bred livestock are, for simplicity, standardised nationally. As could be expected for a home-breeding operation, herd values generally exceed NSC. This difference is tax-deductible to a farmer who elects to exit the herd scheme, usually over about six years as replacement livestock are home-bred. It is this difference that gives rise to the tax advantage that was addressed in the Budget 2012 legislation. Further, farmers could elect out of the herd scheme with a short advance notice period. However, there can be legitimate reasons for electing out of the herd scheme. This is particularly the case when there is a change in a farming regime from breeding to fattening for which a cost-based regime is more natural. The proposals in the bill will explicitly recognise this by allowing an election to exit the herd scheme for a type of livestock when there has been a change to a fattening regime. Section EC 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which presently provides for an election to be made about which herd values to use when the farmer has sold up and ceased farming before 1 February of a year, will be amended. The use of section EC 20 will be compulsory when the sale occurs before 1 November of a year, except when the sale is to an associated person. The proposed new rules will require persons who acquire livestock from an associated person to use that associated person’s herd scheme election and base herd numbers, if any. This associated persons’ rule will apply to matrimonial property settlements and to the tax consequences of death. Therefore section EC 21, which currently deals with death in some circumstances, will be repealed. There will be an exception to this for inter-generational disposal if the vendor ceases farming and the children or grandchildren previously had no interest in the livestock. The Friesian and Jersey dairy classes, and Red and Wapiti deer classes will be combined. Currently, the line between these classes is not clear, making this change the simplest and most appropriate response. 4 EXCEPTION TO HERD SCHEME ELECTIONS BEING IRREVOCABLE (Clauses 28(1) and 29) Summary of proposed amendments Section EC 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains some of the rules concerning restrictions on the use of the herd scheme. When a farmer has elected to use the herd scheme, unless that election was revoked before 18 August 2011, a Budget 2012 amendment to section EC 8 provided that it cannot be subsequently revoked. The current bill rewrites section EC 8 so that the restrictions on the use of the herd scheme and exceptions from those restrictions are clearer. As part of this, a new exception to the Budget 2012 amendment is proposed in clause 28(1) and will allow a farmer to elect to exit the herd scheme when they change to a fattening regime because a cost-based valuation regime much more naturally suits a fattening operation. Clause 29 amends section EC 11 to provide that this is by way of a “same year notice”. Other changes are also proposed to section EC 8 by way of clause 28(2) – these are discussed separately. Application date The rewrite to section EC 8 will apply from 18 August 2011, the date the Budget 2012 legislation on irrevocability applies from. Key features It is proposed that section EC 8 be rewritten to more clearly set out its intent as follows:  Subsection (1) will re-enact the Budget 2012 irrevocability legislation.  Subsection (2) will contain the exception to this, which is for a change to a fattening regime.  Subsection (3) will re-enact the “alternative valuation option” which allows that increases in the number of a class of livestock for which a herd scheme election has been made do not need to be valued under the herd scheme.  Subsection (4) will re-enact the requirement that where the herd scheme has been chosen for a type of livestock, the male breeding stock must be valued under the herd scheme (this is an exception to subsection (3)). The subsection (2) exception to the irrevocability rule applies to a type of livestock for which a herd scheme election is in place and allows for a one-off election to be made to exit the herd scheme. This is in the year that the female breeding livestock are intended to cease being used for breeding purposes and when the livestock of that type are used in a fattening farming business. Clause 29 proposes to amend section EC 11(2) to allow the farmer to give same-year written notice of the change with the tax return for the year. 5 CESSATION OF FARMING – GENERAL RULE (Clause 30) Summary of proposed amendments Section EC 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be amended to provide that when a farmer completely sells their specified livestock before 1 November of a year and ceases deriving income from the disposal of specified livestock, they do not complete the herd scheme adjustment to opening livestock for that year. This date is about half- way between the annual mid-May announcements of the herd values, and so provides a more reasonable basis of valuation of opening herd scheme livestock in the year of the sale. Currently, this section is optional so long as the farmer qualifies, which provides farmers with a tax opportunity. By making it compulsory, appropriate certainty is provided to both farmers and to the Government. An exception is noted in section EC 1B where the disposal is to an associated person. This is discussed separately below. Application date The amendment is effective from 28 March 2012 (in practice, from the 2012–13 income year). 6 DISPOSAL OF LIVESTOCK TO AN ASSOCIATED PERSON (Clauses 26, 28(2), 31, 57(8) and (11)) Summary of proposed amendments New section EC 4B of the Income Tax Act 2007 will provide that the acquirer will be required to use the disposer’s herd scheme elections and base numbers, if any, if the two parties are associated persons. This is to prevent an associated person’s disposal being used to circumvent an election to use the herd scheme. An exception will be made if there is an inter-generational disposal in certain circumstances. To qualify, children or grandchildren must have had no direct or indirect interest in income from the livestock before the transaction (as a discretionary beneficiary or otherwise) and the disposer will be required to cease farming and have no remaining interest in income from the disposal of the livestock after the transaction. Proposed new section EC 4B will contain the core associated person’s transaction rule and the inter-generational exception. Section EC 8 will be amended so that when a farmer has acquired herd scheme livestock from an associated person, the “alternative valuation” rule works by increasing the minimum number of livestock the farmer is required to have to be in the herd scheme. Application date The amendments will apply from 28 March 2012, the date they were announced. Key features Subsection EB 4B(1) proposes that the section applies when livestock that otherwise would have been valued under the herd scheme are transferred to an associated person other than in the ordinary course of business. Subsection (2) proposes that an exception applies when the transfer is inter-generational and the “person” making the transfer is either the parents or the grandparents of the person receiving the livestock. The major requirements will be that:  the person making the transfer ceases owning and earning income directly or indirectly from the disposal of specified livestock as a result of the transfer; and  before the transfer, the person receiving the livestock had no direct or indirect interest in the livestock except through the blood relationship with their parents or grandparents. 7 The sale or other disposal by a dairy farmer of dairy cows to his or her children who then begin 50/50 sharemilking would typically qualify for the exception (because the transferor would not be receiving income from the disposal of specified livestock). Likewise, earning interest or rent from the new farming enterprise would also typically qualify for the exception. However, because of the common use of companies (or sometimes, trusts) for farming purposes, this exception is conceptually complex. It applies to a transfer by an entity associated with the parents or grandparents so long as the children or grandchildren have no association with the entity (for example, they aren’t shareholders or beneficiaries) other than by way of the blood relationship they have with their parents or grandparents. Likewise, the transferee can be an entity associated with the children or grandchildren so long as the parents or grandparents have no association with the entity other than by way of the blood relationship they have with their children or grandchildren. Subsection (3) proposes that, when section EC 4B applies, the transferee is considered to have made an election to use the herd scheme. Subsections (4) and (5) contain the mechanics of the section, as follows:  The classes of livestock transferred to the associated person are classified into the classes they would have been in at the end of the transferor’s income year if the transferor still had them on hand.  The actual number of livestock of that class that the transferor has on hand at the end of that income year is increased by the reclassed number transferred to the associated person determined immediately above.  Then the transferor’s actual number of livestock on hand at the end of this year is subtracted from the lesser of the adjusted number on hand determined immediately above and the number actually on hand at the end of the last year. If positive, any base “alternative valuation” number that the transferee has from the previous year will be increased by this amount. This increase in base number is effected by clause 28(2), which proposes new subsections EC 8(3) and (4) (and subsection EC 8(4) (part of the 18 August 2011 rewrite of section EC 8) is renumbered subsection EC 8(5). The inter-generational exception is handled by way of new definitions of “descendant” and “descended associate” in sections EC 4B(6) and YA 1. The associated persons rules will apply to subparts FB (matrimonial property transactions and FC (death and distributions). Section EC 21 will be consequentially repealed. 8 Examples of the associated persons rule and its inter-generational exception Example 1: Associated persons rule Joe has 250 mixed age (MA) dairy cows on hand that he sells to Joe Farm Limited, a company he owns. Joe would have had to value these cows in the herd scheme at year-end if he hadn’t sold them. Regardless of how it values any other livestock it might own, Joe Farm Limited must value these 250 MA dairy cows in the herd scheme and, if necessary, will be deemed to have made an election to use the herd scheme in the year of acquisition. Joe Farm Limited will be, for the purposes of what is called the “alternative valuation method”, be deemed to have a minimum number of herd scheme livestock on hand at the end of last year and will be required to have regard to that minimum number at year-end. Further, Joe will have to make an opening herd scheme livestock adjustment so that the tax values that Joe and Joe Farm Limited are the same in the year of the sale. This neutralises any taxation impact. For example, Joe Farm Limited might already own 450 MA dairy cows and have valued 300 of those in the herd scheme at the end of the previous year. Joe Farm Limited will be required to value 550 (300 + 250) MA dairy cows in the herd scheme at year-end. Example 2: Inter-generational exception Jill Farm Limited is solely owned by Jill, the daughter of Jack. Further, Jack is ceasing farming as a result of the sale of his 250 dairy cows to Jill Farm Limited. So long as Jill Farm Limited makes the appropriate election, Jill Farm Limited may value the 250 dairy cows using the national standard cost regime under the inter-generation exception to the associated persons rule. Jack may leave part of the purchase price in and derive interest on this and, as well, may work for Jill Farm Limited for wages (so long as these arrangements did not amount to profit sharing). Further, Jill Farm Limited and Jack could enter into a 50/50 sharemilking arrangement. None of these transactions will disturb the inter-generational exception. The key point is that Jill Farm Limited and Joe are not associated persons except for the blood relationship between Jack and Jill. However the exception would not be available if Jack was also a shareholder in Jill Farm Limited, or a beneficiary of a trust that was a shareholder, as both of these ownership models would make him an associated person of Jill Farm Limited other than by the blood relationship. 9 LIVESTOCK CLASSES (Clause 59) Summary of proposed amendment During submissions on the 18 August issues paper, Herd scheme elections, it became clear that there was confusion (and according to some, opportunity) around the boundary between Friesian and Jersey cattle, and Red and Wapiti deer. Combining these deer and cattle classes was suggested to address this. To address these concerns, the weighted average figures will be used to determine values in the future. At the margin, the value of Friesian cattle will decrease and Jersey values will increase, and the same will apply to Wapiti and Red deer. However, over the life of a farming enterprise these amounts will be immaterial. Application date The amendment will apply to values declared in May 2013 for the 2012–13 income year. 10 11 Assets expenditure 12 13 OVERVIEW Some assets, such as holiday homes, aircraft and boats are often used to earn income for their owners and are also used privately. These are commonly referred to as mixed-use assets. Currently, the tax rules allow deductions for expenditure incurred in earning taxable income and disallow deductions for expenditure that relates to the private use of an asset. However, these rules can be difficult to apply to expenditure that does not clearly relate to either the income-earning or private use of an asset. Examples include expenditure that arises while a holiday home, boat or aircraft is unused, and expenditure on general repairs and maintenance. The general presumption is that owners will claim that their asset is available for income-earning use while the asset is not being used privately. This provides them with a basis for claiming tax deductions for expenses relating to this period. However, if the asset is primarily used privately, or the income-earning and private use is relatively equal, the level of deductions owners can claim is often not aligned with the actual income-earning use of the asset. The bill proposes new rules that prescribe the amount of deductions that owners of certain assets can claim. Generally, the rules will apply to assets used to earn income, are used privately and are unused for more than 62 days in an income year. The rules apportion general expenditure on the basis of actual income-earning use divided by the total actual use of the asset. The resultant expenditure will be an allowable deduction. The proposed new rules are designed to improve fairness in the tax system by ensuring that tax deductions are broadly aligned with the income that is earned. They are also intended to increase economic efficiency by reducing the extent to which investment in such assets is driven by tax considerations. The proposed new rules have been developed in response to submissions received in response to the officials’ issues paper, Mixed-use assets, released in August 2011 and subsequent consultation with interested parties. 14 APPLICATION OF THE RULES (Clauses 19 and 35) Summary of proposed amendments The new rules will apply to assets that are used to earn income, are used privately and unused for a period during the year. Assets typically used in this way are holiday homes, boats and aircraft. Expenditure on motor vehicles and assets that are subject to apportionment of expenditure based on space (such as a room used as an office) is excluded from the new rules. The new rules will apply to assets held in a range of structures, such as assets held by individuals, partnerships, trusts and certain companies. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2013–14 income year. Key features The new rules will apply to all forms of ownership, whether the asset is held by an individual, a trust, a partnership or a company. However, when the asset is held in a company the rules will only apply to close companies. Only assets that are used in a particular way will be subject to the new rules. New section DG 3 states that assets will be within the rules if they are:  used to earn income;  used privately; and  not used for at least 62 days (62 working days if the asset is typically only used on work days) in an income year. An asset used in this way will not be subject to the new rules unless it is land (including improvements to land) or has a cost greater than $50,000 (“cost” refers to the cost of the asset to the person). Section DG 3(2) excludes from the rules motor vehicles and assets when existing methods of apportioning expenditure based on space are used. For example, a person who uses a room in his or her family home for business purposes will still be required to apportion expenditure on a floor area basis. “Private use” is defined in the new rules under section DG 4. Private use includes use, regardless of whether market value is paid, by the person who holds the asset or a person who is associated with that person. For the purposes of these rules, associated persons include a partner, siblings, parents, children, grandparents and grandchildren. However, private use will not include use by the person if the asset is of a type that requires expert or specialist knowledge in order for it to be used, the person uses it in 15 that capacity, the income derived directly or indirectly from the use is at market value, and the income derived includes an amount paid for the services of the person. For example, a helicopter used by the owner, for the owner’s commercial farming operation, would not be considered to be private use. Any use at below market value will also be regarded as private use of the asset. Market value is considered to be the price for the use of an asset at a particular time in an open market, freely offered, made on ordinary terms, and to a member of the public at arm’s length. Background Under current legislation a person is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred in earning income or in the course of carrying on a business. No deduction is allowed, however, if the expenditure is private or domestic in nature. These two general rules are difficult to apply to expenditure that has both income- earning and private elements. This type of expenditure often arises when assets such as holiday houses, aircraft and boats are used partly to earn income, partly used privately, and are unused for a portion of the year. Example A holiday house is used by the owner and the owner’s family for 30 nights and rented out for 30 nights in an income year. There is no concern about the owner claiming deductions for expenditure which directly relate to the 30 nights the house is rented out. It is equally clear that no deductions can be claimed for expenditure that directly relates to the 30 nights when the house is used by the owner and the owner’s family. However, it is unclear to what extent the owner can claim a deduction for expenditure that arises when the house is not in use, or expenditure that does not clearly relate to either the income earning or private use of the house, such as repairs and maintenance. Present rules presume that provided the asset is “available for income-earning use”, the associated expenditure is deductible. Consequently, the new rules focus on assets that are used to earn income, that are used privately and are unused for a period during the year. They do not apply to assets where existing rules provide a reasonable basis for apportioning expenditure – such as motor vehicles, that are subject to fringe benefit tax or the log book rules. Further, the rules will not apply when rules and existing practice operate to apportion expenditure based on floor area. Since assets used in this way can be held in various entities, the rules apply to a range of entities types and structures. The new approach is intended to avoid creating an incentive for owners to shift assets from one entity type to another to achieve a more favourable tax outcome. However, when such assets are owned by companies, this has led to complex and detailed rules, particularly for interest apportionment. 16 FULLY DEDUCTIBLE EXPENDITURE (Clause 19) Summary of proposed amendments Expenditure will be fully deductible if it is incurred only to derive income from the asset and delivers no private benefit, or is incurred to meet regulatory requirements. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2013–14 income year. Key features Expenditure will be fully deductible under section DG 7 if it relates solely to using the asset for deriving income and is either:  incurred to earn income, and cannot reasonably be expected to deliver any private benefit – for example, advertising expenditure; or  a reasonable amount and incurred to meet a regulatory requirement that enables the owner to earn income from the asset and would not have been incurred but for the requirement. For example, if all the conditions are met, Maritime New Zealand survey costs that boat owners must incur so they can charter out their own boats would be fully deductible under this rule. Expenditure that is fully deductible does not include expenditure on repairs and maintenance. Background It is intended that the majority of expenditure incurred in relation to assets subject to the new rules will be apportioned. However, there are circumstances when apportioning expenditure would be inappropriate. For example, the costs associated with advertising an asset for rental use deliver no material private benefit and therefore should not be apportioned. Consequently, these costs will remain fully deductible. However, any costs that can be reasonably expected to deliver a private benefit, such as installing a new television, will not be fully deductible. Expenses of this type will typically be apportioned or a deduction will be denied completely if they only deliver a private benefit. Some costs must be incurred to meet regulatory requirements in order to earn income from an asset. For example, certain boats must undergo Maritime New Zealand surveys before the boat is legally allowed to be chartered out. These costs would not normally have been incurred but for the income-earning use of the asset. Consequently, these costs will be fully deductible. However, these costs cannot exceed what would normally be considered reasonable to meet these requirements, nor will they be fully 17 deductible if the owner would have incurred the cost anyway. For example, if an owner of a boat purchases equipment required by regulation in order for the boat to be chartered, and the items purchased are of a higher quality than required under the regulations (and therefore more expensive), the owner can claim a full deduction for the amount up to the amount that is reasonable to meet the requirement for the equipment. The additional cost would be apportioned, as discussed later in this Commentary. 18 APPORTIONMENT OF MIXED-USE EXPENDITURE (Clause 19) Summary of proposed amendments This is the key element of the proposed new rules. Expenses which are neither solely private in nature nor eligible to be deducted in full will be required to be apportioned by dividing the income-earning use by the total use (income-earning use plus private use) of the asset. The resulting amount will be an allowable deduction. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2013–14 income year. Key features Section DG 8 applies to apportion the expenditure incurred by persons that hold a mixed-use asset and section DG 9 sets out the method for apportioning expenditure relating to the asset. Under section DG 9(2), the amount of deductible expenditure, including depreciation, will be calculated as: Example A boat is chartered for 30 days and used by its owners for 30 days. Fifty percent of the general expenditure will be deductible (30 days income-earning use / 60 days total use). The expenditure subject to the formula is the total expenditure incurred minus purely income-earning expenditure under section DG 7 (discussed earlier) and purely private expenditure. “Income-earning days” is defined in section DG 9(3)(b) as the total number of days or other appropriate unit the asset is used to earn income at or above market value. This excludes any days on which the asset is used by the owner, unless that use is an incident of ordinary commercial use (as described in the definition of private use under section DG 4). “Private days” is defined in section DG 9(3)(c) as the total number of days or other appropriate unit the asset is in active use and is not regarded as an income-earning day. For example, days when the owner of a holiday home rents it out to friends and family at below market value will be regarded as private-use days. 19 Example The owner of a boat uses the boat for private enjoyment. The owner also charters the boat to unrelated parties on an arm’s-length basis. The unrelated parties pay market value and the owner skippers the boat during the time the boat is chartered. The owner’s private use of the boat is not regarded as an income- earning day and is, therefore, regarded as a “private-use day”. The chartering to unrelated parties is regarded as an “income-earning day”, even though the owner skippers the boat, as the type of use by the owner is part of the ordinary commercial use of the boat. The unit of measurement used in the formula is a unit that achieves the most appropriate apportionment of expenditure. This might be by reference to days, nights, or hours depending on the asset and how that asset is used. Example The owner of a holiday home rents it out during the year. The owner charges rent by reference to the nights it is occupied. Consequently, the appropriate unit of measurement the owner should use in the formula is nights. 20 INTEREST EXPENDITURE (Clauses 15, 16, 17, 19 and 66) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed new rules require that when a close company holds an asset subject to the rules, any interest expenditure incurred in relation to debt within the company, where the debt is equal to or less than the cost (or rateable value if land) of the asset, will be subject to apportionment. If the debt within the company is less than the cost of the asset, the rules may require group companies, corporate shareholders and non-corporate shareholders, if applicable, to apportion interest on the shortfall of debt. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2013–14 income year. Key features Sections DG 11, DG 12, DG 13 and DG 14 contain the rules that track interest expenditure within and outside of close companies that hold mixed-use assets. Asset-holding company Section DG 11 applies to a close company that holds a mixed-use asset. It requires the company to compare the value of its interest-bearing debt to the value of the mixed-use asset. Interest on debt that is equal to or less than the value of the mixed-use asset is apportioned, under the apportionment formula in section DG 9(2). Interest on debt that exceeds the value of the asset would be subject to existing interest deductibility rules. The asset value is either the cost of the asset or, in the case of land, the rateable value (or its cost on acquisition, if that occurs later). The company’s debt value is the average outstanding amount of debt at the beginning and end of the year. Example Company A holds a mixed-use asset with a cost of $100,000. The company has a total interest-bearing debt of $75,000. The company is required to apportion the interest expenditure on the $75,000 of debt. Company B holds a mixed-use asset with a cost of $100,000. The company has a total interest-bearing debt of $150,000. The company must apportion the average interest expenditure on the $100,000 of debt. Interest on the remaining $50,000 is subject to existing interest deductibility rules. 21 If the company’s interest-bearing debt is less than the value of the asset, that shortfall is referred to as the “net asset balance”. Using the first example above, Company A has a net asset balance of $25,000 ($100,000 – $75,000). Group companies If there is a net asset balance after the application of section DG 11, section DG 12 applies to apportion interest expenditure incurred by group companies, if that is applicable. A group company is defined by reference to the loss grouping rules, being a company that has a 66 percent common voting interest in the company that holds the mixed-use asset. The group of companies is also treated as a wholly owned group. Section DG 12 requires group companies to compare the value of its interest-bearing debt to the net asset balance. Interest on debt that is equal to or less than the net asset balance is apportioned, under the apportionment formula in section DG 9(2). Interest on debt that exceeds the net asset balance would be subject to existing interest deductibility rules. Example Building on the earlier example, Company A is 100 percent owned by another company (Group Company). The Group Company has total interest bearing debt of $10,000. Company A attributes the net asset balance of $25,000 to the Group Company. Group Company must apportion all of its interest expenditure. Debt: $10,000 Interest required to be 100% apportioned: $10,000 Net asset balance: $25,000 The net asset balance reduces by the amount of debt in relation to which interest is required to be apportioned. Using the example above, the net asset balance is now $15,000 ($25,000 – $10,000). Section DG 12 applies to all group companies until the net asset balance is reduced to zero, or there are no longer any group companies in relation to which interest can be apportioned. Corporate shareholders If after the application of sections DG 11 and DG 12 a net asset balance remains, section DG 13 applies to apportion interest expenditure incurred by corporate shareholders that are not group companies. It requires corporate shareholders to compare the value of the company’s interest-bearing debt to the shareholder’s share of the net asset balance. Interest on debt that is equal to or less than the shareholder’s share of the net asset balance is apportioned, under the apportionment formula in section DG 9(2). Interest on debt that exceeds the shareholder’s share of the net asset balance would be subject to existing interest deductibility rules. Company A Group Company 22 The shareholder’s share of the net asset balance is the shareholder’s voting interest, or market value interest (if applicable) expressed as a percentage multiplied by the net asset balance. Example Building on the previous example, Group Company has two corporate shareholders, Company C and Company D who have total interest-bearing debt of $10,000 and $5,000 respectively. Each company’s share of the net asset balance is $7,500 ($15,000 x 50 percent). Therefore, Company C is required to apportion interest in relation to $7,500 of debt, and Company D is required to apportion interest in relation to $5,000 of debt. Company C debt: $10,000 Company D debt: $5,000 Share of net asset balance: $7,500 Share of net asset balance: $7,500 Interest required to be Interest required to be apportioned: $7,500 50% 50% apportioned: $5,000 Net asset balance: $15,000 100% Net asset balance: $25,000 The shareholders’ share of the net asset balance reduces by the amount of debt in relation to which interest is required to be apportioned. Using the example, above Company C’s share of the net asset balance is reduced to zero, and Company D’s share of the net asset balance is reduced to $2,500 ($7,500 – $5,000). Section DG 13 applies first to corporate shareholders that have a shareholding in the close company that holds the asset, and corporate shareholders that have a shareholding in a group company that has a voting interest in the close company that holds the asset. If a net asset balance remains, the section then applies to their shareholders, and so on, until the net asset balance is reduced to zero, or there are no longer any corporate shareholders in which interest can be apportioned. Non-corporate shareholders If after the application of sections DG 11, DG 12 and DG 13, a net asset balance remains, section DG 14 applies to apportion interest expenditure in relation to interest- bearing debt held by non-corporate shareholders. It requires non-corporate shareholders to compare the value of its interest-bearing debt to the shareholders’ share of the net asset balance. Interest on debt that is equal to or less than the shareholders’ share of the net asset balance is apportioned, under the apportionment formula in section DG 9(2). If the non-corporate shareholder is an individual (natural person), the interest expenditure that is subject to apportionment is only the interest expenditure incurred to purchase shares in the company. Company A Group Company Company C Company D 23 Example Building on the previous example, Company D has two natural person shareholders. Shareholder A borrowed $1,000 and Shareholder B borrowed $10,000 to purchase 50 percent each of Company D. Shareholder A and Shareholder B’s share of the net asset balance is $1,250 each ($2,500 x 50 percent). Shareholder A is required to apportion interest in relation to $1,000 of the debt that was incurred to purchase a share in Company D, and Shareholder B is required to apportion interest in relation to $1,250 of the debt that was incurred to purchase a share in Company D. Shareholder A debt: $1,000 Shareholder B debt: 10,000 Share of net asset balance: $1,250 Share of net asset balance: Interest required to be $1,250 apportioned: $1,000 Interest required to be 50% 50% apportioned: $1,250 Net asset balance: $0 Net asset balance: $2,500 50% 50% Net asset balance: $15,000 100% Net asset balance: $25,000 Since Company C’s net asset balance is zero, the rules do not require further interest expenditure to be apportioned by Company C’s shareholders. Notification To enable the operation of sections DG 11, DG 12, DG 13 and DG 14, new section 30D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires companies to provide their shareholders with information to enable them to calculate the correct amount of allowable interest expenditure. Background Interest expenditure relating to mixed-use assets is an expense which must be apportioned like any other. This is straightforward for entities that are not companies. Tracing rules are currently used to identify interest expenditure that is related to the mixed-use asset for entities other than companies. The rules work by identifying what money has been borrowed and look at how that money has been applied. The proposed new rules apply the same approach to interest deductions incurred by entities that are not companies. However, two specific issues arise when mixed-use assets are held in companies. The first issue arises because current legislation provides that all interest incurred by companies is fully deductible, unless a specific limitation applies. Consequently, rules are required to track interest on debt in companies and allocate it to mixed-use assets so it can then be apportioned. If this were not done, mixed-use assets funded by debt could be shifted into companies to avoid the apportionment of interest expenditure. Company A Group Company Company C Company D Shareholder B Shareholder A 24 The second issue arises because an alternative to the company borrowing funds to acquire the asset is for a shareholder to borrow money and use it to subscribe for shares in the company. The overall economic effect is the same – funds have been borrowed and used to acquire a mixed-use asset – but the borrowing is outside the company. Without specific rules, interest on such debt would be outside the apportionment rules. Current law typically provides a deduction when funds are borrowed to acquire shares. To ensure that this kind of structuring is not used to circumvent the proposed new rules, and to capture all relevant interest deductions when complex structuring has been entered into for other commercial reasons, the new rules will track interest incurred by the company’s shareholders and other companies which could loss-group with the company which owns the asset. 25 QUARANTINING EXCESS EXPENDITURE (Clause 19) Summary of proposed amendments Broadly, the new rules will quarantine excess expenditure when the gross income derived from the asset is less than 2 percent of the cost of the asset. The quarantined expenditure will be denied as a deduction in the current income year and can be used in a later year when there are sufficient profits derived from the asset. The new rules will apply to quarantine expenditure incurred by the person who holds the asset, group companies, corporate shareholders and non-corporate shareholders. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2013–14 income year. Key features New sections DG 16 and DG 18 contain the rules that quarantine excess expenditure. The rules apply when the gross income derived from the asset, excluding income from associated persons, is less than 2 percent of the cost of the asset or, in the case of land, the rateable value (or its cost on acquisition, if that occurs later). “Excess expenditure” is defined as the amount of apportioned deductions and previously quarantined amounts that exceed the income derived from the asset. Excess expenditure can be incurred by the person or company that holds the asset, group companies, corporate shareholders and non-corporate shareholders. Section DG 16 – Asset-holding person or company Section DG 16 applies to the person or company that holds the asset. It operates to quarantine excess expenditure that would otherwise be deductible in years when the person’s gross income from the asset is less that 2 percent of the cost or, in the case of land, the rateable value (or its cost on acquisition, if that occurs later). Excess expenditure is the amount by which the person’s total deductions under sections DG 7, DG 8 and DG 11, plus previously quarantined amounts exceed the income derived from the asset (including income from associates). The excess expenditure is denied as a deduction in that year and cannot be used to offset income from other sources. The quarantined expenditure must be carried forward and may be an allowable deduction in future years if the requirements of section DG 17 are met. (This is discussed in more detail later in this Commentary.) 26 Example Company A owns a mixed-use asset that costs $500,000 and derives $5,000 from non-associates and $6,000 from associates for the use of the asset in an income year. Expenditure in that income year (after apportionment) is $12,000. Therefore, Company A has $1,000 of excess expenditure ($12,000 – $11,000). Since the income from the asset, excluding income of $5,000 from associates, is less than 2 percent of the cost of the asset, the excess expenditure incurred by Company A is quarantined and denied as a deduction in the current year. The amount quarantined may be an allowable deduction in a later income year if the requirements of section DG 17 are satisfied. It is possible for a company that holds a mixed-use asset to be in profit, but for the activity to be in overall loss (because group companies and/or shareholders’ interest deductions exceed the company profit). In this situation, no expenditure incurred by the company will be quarantined. However, section DG 18 may apply to quarantine apportioned interest expenditure incurred by group companies and/or other shareholders. Income derived from the asset that exceeds the deduction allowed under sections DG 7, DG 8 and DG 11 (including previously quarantined amounts), is referred to as the “outstanding profit balance”. The outstanding profit balance is then used in section DG 18 to determine how much group company or shareholder-apportioned interest expenditure will be quarantined. Section DG 18 – Group companies and other shareholders Section DG 18 applies to quarantine excess interest expenditure incurred by group companies (under section DG 12) and other shareholders (under sections DG 13 and DG 14) when the income derived from the asset is below the percentage threshold. The amount quarantined is the amount of interest expenditure calculated under sections DG 12, DG 13 and DG 14 (including previously quarantined amounts), which exceeds the outstanding profit balance (or person’s share of the outstanding profit balance if the person is not a group company), calculated under section DG 16. The shareholder’s share of the outstanding profit balance is the shareholder voting interest, or market value interest, if applicable, expressed as a percentage multiplied by the outstanding profit balance. If the outstanding profit balance is zero under section DG 16, all of the group companies’ and other shareholders’ interest expenditure identified under sections DG 12 to DG 14 will be quarantined. Section D 18 first applies to group companies, until no other group companies exist that have apportioned interest expenditure, and then to other shareholders, until no other shareholders exist that have apportioned interest expenditure. As each group company or shareholder applies the section, the outstanding profit balance reduces by the amount of apportioned interest expenditure that is not required to be quarantined. The example below demonstrates the application of section DG 18 when the outstanding profit balance is zero: 27 Example Building on the previous example, Company A is 100 percent owned by another company (Group Company). The Group Company has apportioned interest expenditure under section DG 12 of $10,000. Group Company has two equal natural person shareholders, Shareholder A and Shareholder B who have apportioned interest expenditure under section DG 13 of $2,000, and $4,000 respectively. As Company A’s expenditure exceeded the income derived from the mixed-use asset, the outstanding profit balance is zero, and therefore, Group Company, Shareholder A and Shareholder B are required to quarantine all of their apportioned interest expenditure. Apportioned interest: $2,000 Apportioned interest: $4,000 Quarantined amount: $2,000 Quarantined amount: $4,000 50% 50% Apportioned interest: $10,000 Quarantined amount: $10,000 100% Quarantined expenditure: $7,000 Outstanding profit balance: $0 The example below demonstrates the application of section DG 18 when an outstanding profit balance has been calculated under section DG 16: Example Company B has an outstanding profit balance of $10,000. Company B is 100 percent owned by Group Company, which has apportioned interest expenditure under section DG 12 of $4,000. Group Company has two equal natural person shareholders, Shareholder A and Shareholder B who have apportioned interest expenditure under section DG 12 or DG 13 of $2,000, and $4,000 respectively. Section DG 18 requires that Group Company apply that section first and since the outstanding profit balance exceeds Group Company’s expenditure, it is not required to quarantine any of its apportioned interest expenditure. The outstanding profit balance is then reduced by the deductions claimed by Group Company. The new outstanding profit balance is $6,000 ($10,000 – $4,000). Section DG 18 then requires Shareholder A and Shareholder B to apply the section. Each shareholder’s share of the outstanding profit balance is $3,000 ($6,000 x 50 percent). Shareholder A is not required to quarantine any interest expenditure and Shareholder B is required to quarantine $1,000 of interest expenditure ($4,000 – $3,000). Apportioned interest: $2,000 Apportioned interest: $4,000 Share of outstanding profit Share of outstanding balance: $3,000 asset balance: $3,000 Quarantined amount: $0 50% 50% Quarantined amount: $1,000 Apportioned interest: $4,000 Outstanding profit balance: 100% $6,000 Outstanding profit balance: $10,000 Company B Group Company Shareholder A C Shareholder B D Company A Group Company Shareholder A C Shareholder B D 28 Notification To enable the operation of section DG 18, new section 30D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires companies to provide shareholders with information to enable them to calculate the correct amount of expenditure that is required to be quarantined. Background There is a concern that assets that earn only low levels of income may consistently incur losses, despite the apportionment of expenditure. Some owners of these assets are likely to hold the asset primarily for private enjoyment. Other owners may genuinely hold the asset to earn profits, but be in loss in one particular year due to circumstances outside their control, such as a poor rental season. It is not practical for the tax rules to distinguish between these two situations in the year in which they occur. However, quarantining excess expenditure in particular years when the owner of a mixed-use asset earns low levels of income from the asset avoids the need to make such a distinction. Asset owners who are consistently incurring excess expenditure are very likely to be owners who hold the asset primarily for private enjoyment. They may never have the opportunity to use the quarantined amounts. Owners who genuinely hold their asset for income-earning purposes can still use quarantined amounts in future profitable income years. Since expenditure can be incurred by group companies and other shareholders, the proposed new rules also quarantine expenditure outside the company that holds the asset. There would otherwise be an incentive to shift borrowings on assets subject to the rules to outside the company holding the asset to avoid quarantining. Lastly, to prevent owners influencing gross income in order to satisfy the 2 percent threshold, and therefore gain access to excess expenditure arising from the asset to offset against other income, the rules exclude income from relatives and associates as defined in section DG 3. 29 ALLOCATING QUARANTINED EXPENDITURE (Clause 19) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed new rules allow expenditure that has been quarantined in previous income years to be allocated to income years when there are sufficient profits derived from the asset. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2013–14 income year. Key features Sections DG 17 and DG 19 allow a deduction for expenditure previously quarantined under sections DG 16 and DG 18 in years when income from the asset exceeds deductible expenditure under sections DG 7, DG 8, and DG 11 to DG 14. Section DG 17 – Asset-holding person or company Section DG 17 applies to the person that holds a mixed-use asset. It allows the person a deduction for expenditure previously quarantined under section DG 16 in years when income from the asset exceeds deductible expenditure under sections DG 7, DG 8 and DG 11. Previously quarantined expenditure which is allowed as a deduction is the lesser of the previously quarantined amount or the amount of company profit (current year income derived from the asset minus deductible expenditure under sections DG 7, DG 8 and DG 11). Example An owner of a mixed-use asset derives $12,000 from the use of the asset, and has $8,000 of deductible expenditure under sections DG 7 and DG 8 in the current income year. The owner also has $10,000 of quarantined expenditure from the previous income year. In the current income year, the owner is able to claim a deduction of $4,000 on previously quarantined expenditure ($12,000 – $8,000). Company A holds a mixed-use asset and derives $15,000 from the use of the asset and has $4,000 of deductible expenditure under sections DG 7, 8 and 11 in the current income year. Company A also has $6,000 of quarantined expenditure from the previous income year. In the current income year, the company can claim all of its previously quarantined expenditure. 30 If income derived from the asset exceeds both deductible expenditure under sections DG 7, DG 8 and DG 11 and previously quarantined expenditure, the excess is referred to as the “outstanding profit balance”. Using the example above, Company A has a $5,000 outstanding profit balance ($15,000 – ($4,000 + $6,000)). The outstanding profit balance can then be used under section DG 19 to unlock previously quarantined expenditure incurred by group companies, corporate shareholders and non-corporate shareholders. Section DG 19 – Group companies and other shareholders Section DG 19 applies to group companies, corporate shareholders, and non-corporate shareholders when there is an outstanding profit balance calculated under section DG 17. This section allows a deduction for expenditure previously quarantined under section DG 18 in years where the outstanding profit balance exceeds apportioned current-year interest deductions under sections DG 12, DG 13 and DG 14. Previously quarantined expenditure allowed as a deduction is the lesser of the previously quarantined amount or the amount of outstanding profit balance (or the shareholder’s share of the outstanding profit balance if the shareholder is not a group company) minus current-year apportioned interest deductions. The shareholder’s share of the outstanding profit balance is the shareholder voting interest or market value interest, if applicable, expressed as a percentage multiplied by the outstanding profit balance. Section DG 19 first applies to group companies until the outstanding profit balance has been reduced to zero or no other group companies exist that have previously quarantined expenditure. The section then applies to other shareholders until the outstanding profit balance has been reduced to zero or no other shareholders exist that have previously quarantined expenditure. As each group company or shareholder applies the section, the outstanding profit balance reduces by the amount of quarantined expenditure allowed. 31 Example Building on the previous example, Company A has an outstanding profit balance of $5,000. Company A is 100 percent owned by Group Company, which has apportioned current year interest expenditure under section DG 12 of $2,000 and previously quarantined expenditure of $1,000. Group Company has two equal individual (natural person) shareholders, Shareholder A and Shareholder B, and has apportioned interest expenditure under section DG 14 of $2,500 and $1,000 respectively, and previously quarantined expenditure of $4,000 and $500 respectively. Section DG 19 requires that Group Company apply that section first. Since the previously quarantined amount ($1,000) is less than the outstanding profit balance minus current year deductions ($5,000– $2,000), Group Company is able to claim a deduction in the current year for $1,000. The outstanding profit balance is then reduced by the deductions claimed by Group Company. The new outstanding profit balance is $4,000 ($5,000 – $1,000). Section DG 19 then requires Shareholder A and Shareholder B to apply that section. Each shareholder’s share of the outstanding profit balance is $2,000 ($4,000 x 50 percent). Shareholder A is unable to claim a deduction in the current year for any previously quarantined amounts and Shareholder B is able to claim a deduction in the current year for $500. Apportioned interest: $2,500 Apportioned interest: $1,000 Previously quarantined Previously quarantined amount: $4,000 amount: $500 Share of outstanding profit Share of outstanding balance: $2,000 asset balance: $2,000 Allowable amount: $0 50% 50% Allowable amount $500 Apportioned interest: $2,000 Allowable amount: $1,000 Previously quarantined Outstanding profit balance: amount: $1,000 100% $4,000 Outstanding profit balance: $5,000 Notification To enable the operation of section DG 19, section 30D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires companies to provide shareholders with information to enable them to calculate the correct amount of previously quarantined expenditure that is allocated to the current year. Background In years when income from the asset is below the specified threshold, excess deductions are quarantined. The quarantined expenditure should then be allowed as a deduction in years when the income from the asset exceeds the current year expenditure. Company A Group Company Shareholder A C Shareholder B D 32 ASSETS USED IN BUSINESS (Clause 19) Summary of proposed amendments The new rules will exclude assets predominantly used in business from the quarantining provisions. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2013–14 income year. Key features The new rules will apply to assets which are used in business as well as rented out. However, section DG 20 provides that the quarantining provisions will not apply when the asset is used in business activities and, because of the nature of that activity, income derived by that asset is not separately identifiable. An exception to this is if 80 percent or more of the income-earning use of the asset is a use to which income can be separately attributed to. Income that can easily be attributed to the asset use will normally be rental income. Example A helicopter is used both in a farming business and for the farmer’s personal enjoyment. The total farming operation earns $100,000 of gross income. It is difficult to determine how much of the total farming operation’s gross income is derived from the use of the helicopter. Therefore, the quarantining provisions will not apply unless the exception applies. If the helicopter is used in the farming operations for 10 hours in an income year and is also rented out for 90 hours, the helicopter is subject to the quarantining provisions. This is because the rental use is 90 percent of the total income-earning use of the asset, which is greater than the 80 percent exception threshold. Background It is difficult to apply the 2 percent quarantining threshold to assets used in business. This is because it is impractical to distinguish the gross income derived directly from the mixed-use asset from the income derived from other assets or from labour. 33 Consequently, assets that are predominantly used in business will be excluded from quarantining rules. However, the expenditure relating to an asset will still be required to be apportioned based on the asset’s income-earning days and private-use days. Assets that have an income-earning use of 80 percent or more from rental (or other use where the monetary return on the use is clear) are still subject to the quarantining rules. This is necessary to prevent owners avoiding the quarantining rule by using their asset for a token amount of business use when the majority of the income-earning use was from rental. Example In an income year a helicopter is used in a farming operation for 50 hours, rented out for 100 hours, and used privately for 20 hours. Of the total income-earning use of 150 hours, 100 hours is rental use. This is 66.7 percent, and less than the 80 percent exception threshold. This means that quarantining does not apply expenses related to the helicopter. Apportionment still applies to the expenditure – with the apportionment calculation here being 150/170. 34 OPTION TO TREAT INCOME AS EXEMPT (Clauses 4, 10 and 19) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed new rules will enable owners with low amounts of income, or losses incurred from the asset, to treat the income as exempt. Application date The amendment will apply from the beginning of the 2013–14 income year. Key features New section DG 21 will enable owners whose gross income from the asset in an income year is less than $1,000 to choose to treat the income earned from the asset as exempt income. The owner will not be taxed on any income earned from the asset and cannot claim a deduction for expenses that are incurred in earning that income. Owners who incur a loss from the asset can also choose to treat the income earned from the asset as exempt income. When the mixed-use asset is owned by a company and the company chooses to treat the income earned from the asset as exempt, a deduction will be denied for interest expenditure incurred by shareholders and other group companies identified under sections DG 11, DG 12, DG 13 and DG 14. No formal election or notification process is proposed. Asset owners can choose this approach by omitting the income and the relevant deductions from their tax calculations. However, asset owners must keep sufficient records to be able to verify that they are entitled to apply the section. Background New section DG 21 is designed to address compliance costs. If the potential tax revenue generated by the asset is very small, it is not considered cost effective to require asset owners to file returns and to have Inland Revenue process them. To further reduce compliance costs owners that expect to systematically make tax losses that are quarantined under the rules can opt out of the rules. 35 APPLICATION OF RULES TO PART-YEARS (Clause 19) Summary of proposed amendments The various calculations necessary under the new rules will be adjusted on a pro-rata basis if the asset is held for only part of the year. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2013–14 income year. Key features Section DG 22 contains formulas for calculating the 62-day non-use threshold and a 2 percent quarantining threshold when the asset is held only for part of the year. The formulas are:  The first is for calculating the 62-day unused threshold under section DG 2: Unused threshold Days 365 62  The second is for calculating the 2 percent quarantining threshold under section DG 15: Quarantining threshold Days 365 Asset cost (or rateable value if land) 2 Days in the formulas are the number of days in the income year in which the asset meets the definition of an asset under these rules. Example If an aircraft is purchased 100 days into an income year at a cost of $100,000 and for the rest of the income year that aircraft is used both to earn income and used privately, the total amount of unused days that are needed to satisfy the unused time threshold in section DG 2 is 45 days (265/365 x 62). The gross income required to exceed the 2 percent loss ring-fencing threshold in section DG 8 is $1,452 (265/365 x $100,000 x 2%). 36 Section DG 22 also provides the rules for calculating a company’s debt value and a company’s interest expenditure when the asset is held for only part of the year:  The debt value of the company is defined in section DG 11 as the average outstanding amount that gives rise to the interest payable by the company, measured by reference to the amounts outstanding at the start and at the end of an income year. However, if the asset was acquired or disposed of during the year, the average outstanding debt value is measured from the time the company acquired the asset or from the time the asset was disposed of.  The interest expenditure of a company is also measured from the time the company acquired the asset or from the time the asset was disposed of. Background The proposed 62-day unused threshold and the 2 percent quarantining threshold are designed to work on an income-year basis. The two formulas in section DG 22 appropriately pro-rate the thresholds in years when the asset has been purchased or sold, and therefore only used for part of the year. No pro-rating applies to the $1,000 gross income threshold below which the person who has the asset can treat it as being outside the tax system. This threshold is set for compliance cost reasons, so it is appropriate that it applies at the same level regardless of how short a period in the income year the person has the asset. 37 MIXED-USE ASSETS: GST CHANGES (Clauses 77(1), (2) and (4), 83(1), (3), (4) and (7), 84, 85, 86 and 87) Summary of proposed amendments Changes are being made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 consistent with those being made in the Income Tax Act 2007 for mixed-use assets. These changes will ensure that asset owners that are registered for GST will be able to claim input tax deductions in a similar way as they would be able to claim income tax deductions for the same item. Some GST-specific rules are required to cater for the fact that:  The “main” asset will have a GST component that will need to be apportioned over the ownership period (whereas for income tax purposes this would be capital expenditure).  Some items of expenditure relevant for the income tax calculation will not be relevant for GST (such as interest).  GST is not calculated on an annual basis. Application date The amendments will apply to taxable periods starting from 1 April 2013. Key features Owners of mixed-use assets will, under the proposed changes, be required to apportion their input deductions in a way that reflects their relative taxable and non-taxable use of the asset. This is consistent with the proposed treatment of income tax deductions. The formula used for calculating GST deductions (contained in new section 20G) incorporates the income tax definitions as far as possible. Having the GST calculations as close as possible to those for income tax is intended to reduce the compliance costs associated with the proposed rules. The main differences between the income tax and GST definitions relate to what is “expenditure” and reflect the different nature of the two taxes. In particular, the GST formula replaces “expenditure” with “input tax”. The replacement of expenditure for input tax ensures that GST deductions are based on what the GST Act allows. Expenditure on some assets will be subject to GST, but irrelevant for income tax purposes. The most obvious example is likely to be the main asset itself, which is likely to have a GST component (either explicitly or through the secondhand goods rules). It is also to clarify that input tax on durable assets (such as a holiday house) is relevant for each subsequent adjustment period in the same way as it is for the general apportionment rules. On the other hand, interest is a relevant expense for income tax but not for GST purposes. 38 Detailed analysis Link with apportionment rules The Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 introduced a new set of rules that require registered persons to apportion input tax in accordance with the taxable and non- taxable use of the supply. For example, if a registered sole-trader acquired a car that she estimated was to be used half of the time for business purposes, she would be entitled to claim half of the input tax on the car as a deduction in the first period of ownership. As mixed-use assets are also used partly for private and partly for business purposes, the apportionment rules should also apply to expenditure in relation to these assets. To this end, under the proposals in the bill, the definitions used in the apportionment rules: “percentage intended use”, “potential actual use” and “percentage difference” will be extended to apply to the mixed-use asset formula (section 20G). As with the general apportionment rules and the formula used for income tax, section 20G will require a registered person to perform annual calculations to determine the level to which they can claim input tax deductions. Section 20G will then require the registered person to pay any output tax or allow them to claim input tax on any positive or negative adjustment produced by the formula. As with the income tax rules, no apportionment is required for input tax that relates solely to the income-earning use of an asset and no deduction is available for amounts that relate solely to the private use of the asset. Applying the new formula One issue specific to GST is that GST is not generally calculated on an annual basis, so GST-registered owners of mixed-use assets will be required to file returns on a monthly, two-monthly or six-monthly basis. Although the general apportionment rules provide for annual adjustments, the bill provides guidance for determining when the calculation is performed and what to do for intervening taxable periods. Proposed sections 20(3JB)(b) and 20G require a person to perform the calculation at the end of an adjustment period, as defined. This is usually an annual period. However, the proposed rules require the registered person to estimate their taxable use of a supply in the intervening periods and calculate their actual taxable use at the end of each adjustment period. This wash-up calculation will determine the person’s true tax position for each of the taxable periods within the adjustment period. To ease the compliance burden on registered persons, the rules require input tax in the adjustment period to be aggregated. Only if the estimated deductions are 10 percentage points or greater than the actual taxable use (or less than 10 percentage points but more than $1,000) is a wash-up necessary (see section 20G(6)). 39 Example In May, John, a registered person who accounts for GST on a six-monthly basis, acquires a holiday house on the open market for $575,000 including GST. John’s taxable periods conclude at the end of October and April, and he has a standard balance date. On acquisition, he estimates that his taxable use of the house will be 50 percent. John’s expenditure in the first period is: Item Cost GST component House $575,000 $75,000 Rates, insurance and utilities $1,725 $225 Based on his 50 percent taxable use estimate, John claims deductions of $37,612 in his first return. In the following six-months, John continues to incur rates, insurance and utilities expenses of $2,070. The end of the following period is also John’s balance date, and John chooses to make this the end of his first adjustment period. 1 After performing the calculation for mixed-use asset expenditure, John discovers his actual taxable use of the asset for the adjustment period was 35 percent. This is greater than a 10 percentage points difference from his estimate, so a wash-up calculation is required. John’s total expenditure for the year is therefore: Item Cost GST component House $575,000 $75,000 Rates, insurance and utilities $3,795 $495 Based on his actual use of 35 percent, John’s input entitlement for the year is $26,423 ($75,495 x 0.35). John’s claimed deduction of $37,612 in his first return was an over-estimate. As a result of the wash-up calculation, he is required to account for output tax of $11,189 (being the difference between the $37,612 claimed and his actual entitlement of $26,423) in his return following the end of the adjustment period. An alternative approach, which ensures greater accuracy but that might reduce cash- flow, would be for the registered person to delay claiming input deductions in the intervening periods and instead claim their annual entitlement at the end of each adjustment period when the calculation is performed. 2 Disposal Proposed section 20G(7) provides that the disposal of the relevant asset by a registered person will be a taxable supply and sections 8 and 21F will apply. This means that output tax will be payable on the disposal and a registered person will be able to apply the section 21F formula to claim additional input tax. 1 John does have the option of delaying the end of the first adjustment period for 12 months under section 21G(2)(a)(ii). 2 Section 20(3) allows deductions from output tax to be claimed any time up to the second anniversary of the relevant supply. 40 41 Other policy matters 42 43 GST: CROSS-BORDER BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS NEUTRALITY (Clauses 68, 75(1), 79, 80(2), 83(2), (5) and (6), 89, 90, 91 and 92) Summary of proposed amendments The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) is being amended to change the rules governing when a non-resident business can register for GST and claim input tax deductions. As GST is intended to be a tax on final consumers rather than businesses, the amendments are intended to allow non-resident businesses to register and claim deductions in a broadly similar manner to a comparable New Zealand-resident business. Non-resident businesses will, however, only be able to register if they are either registered for a consumption tax (such as GST, or value added tax in Europe) in the jurisdiction of which they are resident. If they reside in a country that does not have a consumption tax, the non-resident will need to satisfy the Commissioner that they carry on a taxable activity overseas with a turnover exceeding $60,000 per annum. Other provisions are also being proposed to protect the revenue base from fraudulent refunds. These provisions include the Commissioner having the ability to deregister a non-resident in certain circumstances. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2014. Key features Registration Under section 51(3) of the GST Act, the Commissioner has the discretion to register any person that carries on a taxable activity, even if their taxable supplies are below the compulsory registration threshold. This section currently applies to both residents and non-residents that carry on a taxable activity. New section 54B will apply to a non-resident that wishes to voluntarily register in New Zealand. New section 20(3L) will allow non-residents to claim input deductions without the need to be making taxable supplies in New Zealand. Section 54B sets out that a non-resident can only register if they satisfy the Commissioner that:  they are registered for a consumption tax in the jurisdiction they are resident in. This would include, for example, GST in other jurisdictions or VAT in Europe; or 44  if they are resident in a jurisdiction that does not have a consumption tax, they carry on a taxable activity in another country that would require them to register for GST if that activity were carried out in New Zealand. This means the person must be able to demonstrate that they make taxable supplies of greater than the $60,000 registration threshold. The second criterion is necessary because not every country operates a GST or similar consumption tax. To protect the tax base, non-resident businesses who wish to register in New Zealand should have a significant offshore business presence. In either case, the person must satisfy the Commissioner that their input tax in New Zealand for the first period of registration will be more than $500. This measure recognises that the registration and return processing procedures require the Commissioner to incur administration costs. Having a minimum input tax amount, removes the ability to claim very small amounts, which are disproportionate to the administrative costs of processing the claim. There is a further limitation on a non-resident’s ability to register, proposed in section 54B(1)(c). This section provides that a non-resident is ineligible to register if they on- supply services when it is reasonably foreseeable that those services will be received in New Zealand by a non-registered person. An example of this is tourism, where tourism products (such as coach tours and accommodation) are received in New Zealand by individual non-residents who are not themselves registered for GST. Given that these products are ultimately enjoyed in New Zealand by individuals, the policy is that GST applies to them. Although allowing registration would require the non-resident business to charge GST to the tourist, this would be difficult to enforce. For migrating registered persons, section 54B(2) will require the person to treat the day of change of residency status as the end of a taxable period. This means that returns filed by the person will be either as a resident or a non-resident, with no requirement for a return reflecting both statuses. Groups of companies As a supplement to the registration rules, proposed section 55(1B) sets out that a GST group established after the date of introduction of this bill cannot include both resident and non-resident members. This is a departure from the current rules, but is considered necessary as a base protection measure. When a group comprises both resident and non-resident members, the input tax attributable to the activities of the non-resident members cannot be distinguished in the amalgamated return provided by the representative member. A tax advantage could be provided through offsetting input claims of a non-resident with the output liabilities of resident group members, which would be more apparent for non-residents with no economic activity in New Zealand. It would be preferable from a tax administration perspective to have some visibility on the level of input deductions being claimed by non-residents so that any tax base risk can be more readily identified. Having this change apply only from the date of introduction will save existing groups from having to separate. 45 If a cross-border group does form after the date of introduction, sections 55(9) and (10) will require it to split into its resident and non-resident components – with the Commissioner having the ability to limit the group to its resident members if such separation is not volunteered. Claiming deductions New section 20(3L) will provide the main deduction rule for registered non-residents. It effectively mirrors the main deduction rule in subsection (3C), but clarifies that the non- resident’s ability to claim deductions is based on an assumption that all of their supplies were both made and received in New Zealand. This means that, for example, if a person makes worldwide supplies, some of which would be taxable and some exempt under New Zealand’s domestic GST system, their ability to deduct will depend on the ratio of their taxable supplies. Such a system ensures that the non-resident is placed in roughly the same position as a New Zealand resident that provided a similar range of services. Example 1 Air Africa is a passenger airline operating out of Cape Town. It flies domestically within South Africa and internationally. It sends some trainee pilots to New Zealand for some specialised training and incurs GST on those training costs. If Air Africa were a New Zealand-resident airline making only domestic flights, its supplies would all be taxable. The training is expenditure for services that are used in making its general supplies of passenger transport. As a result, Air Africa is entitled to claim all of the GST incurred as a deduction. Assuming it makes no taxable supplies in New Zealand, the GST incurred will be available as a refund. Example 2 Bank Co is a financial services and insurance provider that is registered for GST in Australia and is looking to expand into New Zealand. It registers for GST in New Zealand and incurs GST on professional services fees it receives from a New Zealand provider. Its Australian business comprises 50% household mortgages, 25% life insurance and 25% health and contents insurance. Both the mortgage provider and life insurance components of its business would be exempt if they were made and received in New Zealand on the basis that they are financial services. Bank Co can therefore claim 25% of the GST incurred as a deduction in its New Zealand return. A proposed amendment to section 20(3K) will also clarify that the input deduction rules that apply to non-profit bodies are limited to New Zealand resident non-profit bodies. Registration status and administration It is proposed that non-residents will only be able to be registered on a payments basis. New sections 19(1A) and 19A(1)(iv) will facilitate this. The provision is designed to limit the possibility of a non-resident claiming a refund on the basis of invoices provided by registered residents on which no payment is made and, therefore, no GST is paid. This is a tax base protection measure. 46 Similarly, proposed section 46(1B) will extend the timeframes for the Commissioner under section 46 from 15 days (as applies to residents) to 90 days for non-residents in certain circumstances. These are:  issuing a refund;  requesting further information; and  investigating the circumstances of a return. Extending the timeframes in these circumstances will afford the Commissioner more time to establish that a refund claim by a non-resident is valid. The extended period will allow the Commissioner time to establish contact with and engage the non-resident – recognising that there could be language barriers and other unforeseen delays in this communication. Where there is a more significant risk, it may also allow the Commissioner time to reconcile the claim with the GST return of the counter-party to a particular transaction. A related change to section 120C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 also switches off use-of-money interest for the purposes of providing GST refunds to non-residents. No special rules are proposed for the taxable periods of non-residents, so they will be registered on a monthly, two-monthly or six-monthly basis, as appropriate. Cancellation of registration Currently, section 52(7) allows the Commissioner to cancel the registration of a non- resident if they are not carrying out a taxable activity in New Zealand. This rule is incompatible with the aims of the changes in the bill, so this section is being repealed and replaced with a specific set of deregistration rules for non-residents in section 54C. The Commissioner may cancel the registration of a non-resident if:  The Commissioner is satisfied that the person no longer meets the requirements of section 54B(1)(a). This means that if the Commissioner is satisfied that the person is no longer registered for consumption tax in their resident jurisdiction or does not make taxable supplies of greater than the New Zealand registration threshold (as applicable), their registration may be cancelled.  The non-resident fails to file a return, or files late returns for three consecutive periods. If a person is deregistered under this rule, they are deregistered effective from the first day of the third period and cannot apply for re-registration for five years. This exclusion also applies to non-resident associated persons to avoid effective re-registration under another name.  The non-resident registers between the date of introduction of this bill and 1 April 2014, or migrates offshore at a later date, and does not satisfy the Commissioner that they are entitled to remain registered. This is to ensure consistent treatment across all non-residents that register after the announcement of the proposed rules. 47 Effect of cessation of registration New section 5(3B) will apply to non-residents that cease to be registered. Similar to the general deregistration rule in section 5(3), this provides that output tax is payable on the relevant assets of the person’s taxable activity. However, section 5(3B) recognises that it would not be appropriate to tax the worldwide assets of a non-resident at the time of deregistration. Instead, it provides that only goods present in New Zealand and services that would be supplied in New Zealand at the time of deregistration are subject to the deemed supply rules. 48 GST: ZERO-RATING OF TOOLING COSTS (Clause 78) Summary of proposed amendment A new zero-rating rule is proposed that will allow GST-registered manufacturers to zero-rate the supply of certain tooling costs charged to a non-resident customer. Application date Given it is seen as part of a broader package of neutrality changes, this amendment also applies from 1 April 2014. Key features The tools must be:  supplied to a non-resident that is not registered; and  used solely to manufacture exported goods. The rule will not be available for tools supplied to a non-resident when the goods produced will be used for both the domestic and export markets. Background The proposed rule is part of increasing business-to-business neutrality (the bulk of these changes are set out above in the proposals to allow non-resident businesses to register for GST). As the tooling costs are related to the broader export of goods, there are sound policy reasons for effectively treating these costs are part of the export. This is consistent with the rule in section 11A(1)(m) that zero-rates services provided directly in connection with exported goods. The proposed rule also imports language used in Australian and European legislation, bringing New Zealand into line with international norms around the charging of tooling costs to non-residents. 49 TIME PERIOD FOR REFUNDS UNDER THE INCOME TAX ACT 2007 (Clauses 6, 7, 41 to 44, 46 to 56 and 67) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being made to reduce the time period when refunds can be claimed under the Income Tax Act 2007 to four years from the year of assessment. Application date The amendment will apply from the 2013–14 income year. Key features The Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to reduce the time period for refunds under the Act to four years from the year of assessment. This time period would be applied consistently to all refunds. In the case of the donations tax credit which is cashed out separately from the income tax process, the time period for taxpayers requesting refunds will become four years from the end of the tax year in which the donation was made. Background If too much tax has been paid, the excess amount is refundable to the taxpayer. Over the years, the time periods for requesting refunds under the Income Tax Act have varied from between three and eight years. The refund period was aligned with the time bar (four years) in 1944. At the time, it was considered that the time period for a taxpayer to claim a refund should be aligned with the time period for the Commissioner to amend an assessment. With the introduction of PAYE in 1957, the refund period was increased to six years in recognition of the possibility that employers could make mistakes in their calculations. It was increased to eight years in 1968. In 2004, the refund period was amended. The current period is four years from the date of assessment, with an eight-year period applying when the overpayment results from a clear mistake or simple oversight. The longer periods for refunds were established in an era when the administrative environment was based on assessments carried out by the Commissioner. Departing from four years for a refund was aimed at ensuring taxpayers were not unduly prejudiced by any errors made by employers or the Commissioner when the PAYE scheme was introduced (as systems were not computerised). The time limits on refunds of tax paid in excess, and on the Commissioner amending assessments when insufficient tax has been paid, represent a trade-off between achieving finality and ensuring the correct amount of tax has been paid. 50 In today’s modern tax administration environment, there is some question whether an eight-year refund period is consistent with the policy objective of reaching a balance between the finalising of a taxpayer’s tax position at the earliest practicable stage and the accuracy of that position. The time limit on the Commissioner to increase an assessment of tax is generally four years from the year of assessment. The Commissioner requires a period in which to determine the accuracy of taxpayer assessments. Setting the time period for refunds at four years aligns the time period for taxpayers requesting refunds with the time period for the Commissioner increasing an assessment. This approach will also mean that taxpayers requesting refunds will be treated similarly. The refund period for taxpayers who are personal tax summary taxpayers is currently four years. Under the proposed amendment all taxpayers will have a refund period of four years from the year of assessment. The proposed new refund period is similar to that in other jurisdictions – for example, the time period in the United States is three years, and in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia it is generally four years. 51 FAIR DIVIDEND RATE FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES (Clauses 9, 24, 33 and 57) Summary of proposed amendment At present, there is a mismatch in the tax treatment of foreign currency hedges and certain offshore assets – those that are taxed under the fair dividend rate (FDR) rules and certain Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) listed shares. This mismatch makes it more difficult to effectively hedge investments in certain offshore assets. To address this, the bill provides for a new, optional rule that effectively allows eligible taxpayers to apply FDR to their foreign currency hedges rather than the financial arrangement rules. This new rule is designed to, as much as possible, eliminate the tax mismatch. To ensure this new rule is robust, there will be restrictions on when the new rule can be applied to ensure that it is used as intended. Application date The new rule will come into effect from the beginning of the 2013–14 income year. Key features  The bill will create new subpart EM, which provides for a new tax calculation method for certain foreign currency hedges entered into for assets taxed under FDR or ASX-listed shares that are not subject to the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules provided the sale of those shares would not be taxable.  The new rule will be optional. Eligible taxpayers will be able to elect what hedges it will apply to, and to what extent it will apply for each hedge (subject to maximums to ensure the use of the new rule is appropriate).  The new rule will apply only to widely held entities to help ensure it is used only as intended. Such entities generally have muted incentives to take aggressive tax positions, have investment mandates and other documentation that disclose investment strategies. Background At present, there is a mismatch in the tax treatment of foreign currency hedges and certain offshore assets. For example, under the FDR rules, changes in an asset’s value are not taxed. Instead, FDR assets are generally taxed on an imputed return of 5 percent. Conversely, changes in a hedge’s value are fully taxed under the financial arrangement (FA) rules. This mismatch in treatment means that a hedge that is effective in removing the impact of unexpected currency fluctuations before tax ceases to be effective after tax. 52 To illustrate, say a person has an offshore asset portfolio worth US$10,000 and the NZD/USD exchange rate unexpectedly rises from $0.75 to $0.80. The person’s asset portfolio is taxed under the FDR rules. In New Zealand dollars, the portfolio’s value falls from NZ$13,333.33 to NZ$12,500.00. If the person had used a foreign currency hedge to completely remove exchange rate risk, before tax is taken into account, the hedge will increase in value by NZ$833.33, exactly cancelling the change in their portfolio’s value. The hedge is totally effective before-tax. The story is different after-tax. The offshore assets have lost NZ$833.33 of value. However, under the FDR rules, no deduction is given for this decrease. Despite this, the $833.33 increase in the hedge’s value is taxable. After-tax, the person has lost NZ$833.33 from their asset portfolio but gained only NZ$600.00 from their hedge; the shortfall of $233.33 is created by the tax payment. Concept of a hedge In essence, a basic foreign currency hedge is a currency swap. At some future date (the “contract date”), a person promises to exchange a fixed amount of foreign currency (“foreign amount hedged”) with a fixed amount of domestic currency (“domestic amount hedged”). Because the amount of foreign and domestic currency is fixed when the swap is entered into, this has the effect of “locking in” a future exchange rate for the person. The value of a foreign currency hedge is measured as the difference between the hedged exchange rate and the market’s best guess of what the exchange rate will be on the contract date. The fair value of a hedge should begin at zero as the “locked in” exchange rate will equal the market’s best guess of what the exchange rate will be on the contract date. In later periods the forward rate for the contract date may change. If this happens it will drive a wedge between the contract rate and the forward rate, increasing or decreasing the value of the hedge. For example, say a hedge allows an individual to exchange (sell) US$100 (i.e. the foreign amount hedged) for NZ$200 (ie the domestic amount hedged) (contract rate of 0.50) for value 1 January 2011 (the contract date). This contract rate will be the same as the market calculated forward rate of 0.50 for 1 January 2011. The value of the hedge contract is therefore $0 – the contract and forward rates are the same. If at a later date the forward rate for value 1 January 2011 moves to $0.60, the unrealised value of the hedge will increase to $33.33. The reason for this is because the change in the forward rate indicates that it is now expected for the exchange rate on 1 January 2011 will be $0.60. Accordingly, when the hedge is realised the individual would expect to make $33.33 (they will give up US$100, which at the current exchange rate is worth NZ$166.66, and in return will receive NZ$200). Importantly, in order for something to be a “hedge” it must be used to back an asset denominated in a foreign currency. This means that changes in the value of the hedge will offset changes in the foreign denominated asset. The foreign amount hedged in the currency being hedged cannot exceed the value of assets denominated in that currency. To illustrate, say in the example above the individual had US$100 of USD-denominated assets. Because of the change in the exchange rate from $0.50 to $0.60, the value of these assets in NZD would fall from NZ$200 to NZ$166.66. However, the hedge has increased in value by NZ$33.33, cancelling out this fall. If, however, the individual had no USD-denominated assets, they would have suffered no loss but have made a gain on the foreign currency swap. Thus the swap is not a true “hedge” – it is just currency speculation. Such speculation should rightly be taxed under the financial arrangement rules. The apportionment rules and quarterly test described below are designed to ensure the new rule covers only true hedges. 53 Detailed analysis New calculation for income or deductions from a hedge New section EM 6 is the core of the new rule. It will provide that a taxpayer has income or an expense of: FDR portions’ value is the current market value of a taxpayer’s hedges to the extent that the taxpayer has elected for this rule to apply to those hedges. This calculation will need to be carried out every day. Because hedges are generally short term, this calculation must be performed numerous times over a hedge’s life for it to be effective. This daily calculation aligns with how eligible entities calculate their tax liability on eligible assets. The tax calculation for FDR assets is based on an imputed 5 percent return and is done on a daily basis – a calculation that is very similar to the above. The calculation also closely matches the tax treatment of ASX-listed shares that are not subject to the FIF rules (meaning tax is simply levied on dividends received) as the estimated dividend yield from such a share is 5 percent per year. The bill also inserts new sections CV 18 and DV 25, which will provide that the income or expense calculated using the above formula is taxable or deductible (as applicable). Note that section DV 25 does not override the general permission, so any deemed expense that arises under section EM 6 will need to be related to a taxpayer’s business in order for it to be deductible. The capital limitation will be overridden to ensure that a negative result of the above formula arising due to eligible ASX-listed shares held on capital account is deductible. Financial arrangement rules will not apply New section EM 1(3) provides that the financial arrangement rules do not apply to a hedge to the extent a taxpayer has elected for this new rule to apply under section EM 4 (its fair dividend rate hedge portion). Tax on the hedge will be calculated solely under subpart EM. The financial arrangement rules will apply as normal to the remainder of the hedge. Eligible assets The new tax calculation method will be available in relation to hedges that hedge:  assets that are taxed under the FDR method; and  shares listed on the ASX exchange which are not subject to the FIF rules provided the sale of those shares would be exempt under section CX 55 or would be a capital receipt as the shares are held on capital account. 54 The purpose of the new rule is to align the tax treatment of foreign currency hedges with the assets those hedges are entered into for. This mismatch is most significant for hedges entered into for the asset types listed above. For other assets the mismatch is either much less pronounced or does not exist, so the current treatment is more appropriate. In addition to this asset-type requirement, an asset’s market value must also be calculated on a daily basis in order for it to be an eligible asset. This is so the calculation in section EM 6 can be carried out daily, as set out above. Eligible entities The new rule is designed to apply only to widely held investment funds and other similar entities. This restriction is designed to help ensure the new rule will be used only as intended. Widely held funds generally have muted incentives to take aggressive tax positions and have investment mandates and other documentation that disclose investment strategies. This restriction will be provided by new section EM 2, which will largely mimic the widely held entity criteria in the Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) rules (sections HM 14 and HM 15, together with the exemptions in sections HM 21 and HM 22). Eligible hedges and hedge portions The new rule can only be used in relation to genuine foreign currency hedges – financial arrangements that are entered into with the sole purpose of offsetting exposure to foreign currency exchange movements in the value of their assets. To reflect this, new section EM 3 provides the criteria for an eligible hedge. For example, a hedge must not be entered into with an associated person and, when it is first entered into, must have a fair value of zero. An eligible hedge will not automatically be subject to the new tax calculation. A taxpayer will need to elect, on the day it enters into a hedge, that the new tax calculation is to apply. The new calculation will be able to be applied to part or all of a hedge. Accordingly, the taxpayer’s election will need to include the portion of the hedge to be subject to the new calculation (the fair dividend rate hedge portion of the hedge), although there are limits on this (see below). There will be no prescribed way for how this election is to be made, but sufficient record of elections must be kept in order to satisfy the general record-keeping requirements placed on taxpayers. 55 Maximum fair dividend rate hedge portions The intention of the new rule is that it should only apply to hedges entered into for certain types of offshore investment – those assets where the tax mismatch is most significant. It is appropriate that hedges entered into for other types of offshore investment continue to be taxed as they are currently. Accordingly, new section EM 5 provides rules that set out the maximum fair dividend rate hedge portion that a taxpayer can elect. There are two possible methods that a taxpayer will be able to use to determine this maximum. A taxpayer will be required to use the same calculation method for all of its hedges. The first method is designed to be accurate but may be relatively complicated to apply. The second method is simpler but may be less accurate so, to balance this, it is more restrictive. These calculations will only need to be performed on the day a hedge is first entered into. There will be a quarterly test, described below, to ensure that a hedge’s initial fair dividend rate hedge portion remains appropriate over time. Method one The first calculation method will use the formula: ( ) Eligible currency assets will be eligible assets (as described above) denominated in the same currency as the hedge being entered into (the calculation currency). Proxied currency assets will be eligible assets denominated in a different currency but the taxpayer hedges that currency with the calculation currency. 3 All amounts in the formula will be expressed in the calculation currency. FDR hedges amount will be the amount of the calculation currency that is hedged by the taxpayer’s hedges, excluding the hedge that the calculation is being carried out for (the calculation hedge), to the extent that they have elected for this new tax calculation method to apply (i.e. each hedge’s fair dividend rate hedge portion). Calculation hedge amount is the amount of foreign currency that is hedged by the calculation hedge. 3 It is generally impractical to hedge every currency a fund is exposed to. Funds therefore often do what is referred to as “proxy hedging”. They find correlations between the smaller currencies and larger ones (such as the USD), and hedge their exposure to the smaller currencies using the larger ones. 56 Example Z has a portfolio of:  US$20,000 worth of shares in US-based companies (eligible assets, worth NZ$40,000)  AU$10,000 worth of shares in Australian companies (eligible assets, worth NZ$15,000)  AU$20,000 worth of Australian bonds (non-eligible assets, worth NZ$30,000) Z has currently has two foreign currency hedges:  A hedge for US dollars with a foreign amount hedged of $20,000 (equivalent to NZ$40,000) and a fair dividend rate hedge portion of 0.50.  A hedge for Australian dollars with a foreign amount hedged of $20,000 (equivalent to NZ$30,000) and a fair dividend rate hedge portion of 0.25. Z is looking to enter into a new hedge for AU$10,000. The maximum fair dividend rate portion for the hedge would be 0.55: ( ) ( ) Method two The second calculation method uses the formula: Unlike method one, this calculation will be made with reference to a taxpayer’s assets regardless of the currency they are denominated in, not just the calculation currency. This may make it simpler for some taxpayers. Non eligible currency assets will be the total value of a taxpayer’s foreign assets excluding eligible assets, converted to New Zealand dollars. Hedges amount will be the total amount of foreign currency that is hedged by a taxpayer’s hedges including the calculation hedge, again converted to New Zealand dollars. Importantly, this is not the amount of New Zealand dollars hedged; it is the amount of foreign currency hedged expressed in New Zealand dollars at the day’s prevailing exchange rate. To ensure a taxpayer cannot over-hedge using method two, if the result of the formula below is above 1.05, a taxpayer will not be able to elect to use the new method for new hedges. Currency hedges will be the total value of the taxpayer’s offshore assets converted to New Zealand dollars. Hedges amount will be the same as in the previous formula. 57 Example Z from the example above decides instead to use the second method to calculate the maximum fair dividend rate portion for its new $10,000 Australian dollar hedge. This hedge is equivalent to NZ$15,000. The value of Z’s non-eligible assets in New Zealand dollars is $30,000. The total amount of foreign currency hedged by Z, expressed in New Zealand dollars, is $85,000. Accordingly, the hedge’s maximum fair dividend rate hedge portion will be 0.65 unless the result of second formula below is greater than 1.05: First formula Second formula The second formula’s result is 1.00, so the maximum fair dividend rate hedge portion of 0.65 stands. Quarterly test The two proposed apportionment methods described above will provide the appropriate maximum fair dividend rate hedge portions initially. However, a quarterly test is also required to ensure the taxpayer’s initial allocation is still appropriate. The formula below provides a taxpayer’s quarterly FDR hedging ratio: FDR hedges amount will be the total amount of foreign currency that is hedged by a taxpayer’s hedges to the extent the taxpayer has elected for this tax calculation to apply to those hedges (i.e. the fair dividend rate hedge portion of each hedge), converted to New Zealand dollars. Again this will not be the amount of New Zealand dollars hedged but is the amount of foreign currency hedged expressed in New Zealand dollars at the day’s prevailing exchange rate. Eligible currency assets will be the total value of the taxpayer’s eligible assets, also converted to New Zealand dollars. If a person’s quarterly FDR hedging ratio is greater than 1.05 they must adjust the fair dividend rate hedge portion to the result of the formula below: The effect of this formula will be to bring an entity’s quarterly FDR hedging ratio to 0.85. This adjustment will be required to be carried out, at the most, five days after the end of the quarter. 58 If a taxpayer breaches the threshold in two consecutive quarters, they will not be able to use this new tax calculation method for the remainder of the income year and the next income year for any new hedges it enters into. Example At the end of a quarter, the value of Y’s portfolio is:  US$10,000 worth of shares in US-based companies (eligible assets, worth NZ$20,000)  AU$20,000 worth of shares in Australian companies (eligible assets, worth NZ$30,000) Y currently has a single foreign currency hedge: a hedge for US dollars with a foreign amount hedged of $20,000 (equivalent to NZ$40,000) and a fair dividend rate hedge portion of 0.40. In the first formula, FDR hedges amount is NZ$16,000 (=$40,000 \* 0.40) and eligible currency assets is NZ$50,000 (=$20,000 + $30,000). The result of the formula is 0.32: Y will therefore pass the quarterly test. Say next quarter Y enters into a hedge in addition to its USD hedge: a hedge for AU$30,000 (equivalent to NZ$45,000) with a fair dividend rate hedge portion of 1.00 (note: this would exceed the maximum fair dividend rate hedge portion allowed, but for simplicity is ignored). If the exchange rate or prices do not change, FDR hedges amount will now be NZ$61,000 (=$40,000 \* 0.40 + $45,000 \* 1.00) but eligible currency assets remains at NZ$50,000. The result of the formula is now 1.22: This exceeds 1.05, so Y will have to adjust its two hedges as follows so the fair dividend rate hedge portions on its US dollar and Australian dollar hedges are 0.28 and 0.70, respectively. US dollar hedge Australian dollar hedge 59 CHARITIES WITH OVERSEAS PURPOSES (Clauses 2(15) and 61) Summary of proposed amendments The bill adds three new charitable organisations to schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Donors to the following charities will be eligible for tax benefits on their donations:  The Hunger Project New Zealand;  OneSight New Zealand; and  Fund for Timor. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2013. Background Donors to organisations listed in schedule 32 are entitled as individual taxpayers, to a tax credit of 33⅓ of the amount donated, up to the value of their taxable income. Companies and Māori authorities may claim a deduction for donations up to the level of their net income. Charities that apply funds towards purposes mostly outside New Zealand must be listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 before donors become eligible for these tax benefits. The three charitable organisations being added to schedule 32 are engaged in the following activities:  The Hunger Project New Zealand works to reduce hunger and poverty in South Asia, Africa and Latin America. The aim of the group is to assist local groups to improve health education, nutrition and family income.  OneSight New Zealand works to assist people with vision impairment, eye diseases and eye afflictions.  Fund for Timor aims to improve education and literacy in remote areas of East Timor by funding local teachers’ salaries. 60 61 Remedial matters 62 63 CLARIFICATION OF THE “DIVIDEND” DEFINITION (Clauses 5, 57(4) and (5), 100 and 107) Summary of proposed amendment The definition of “dividend” is being amended to make it clear that certain transactions are not treated as dividends for tax purposes. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2005–06 income year. Key features Both the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 will be amended so that it is clear that certain transactions are not dividends for tax purposes. The transactions are listed below. Rights issues Companies can offer their shareholders rights to buy new shares, generally at a discount to the market value. It is proposed that legislative changes be made to make it clear that the discounted amount is not a taxable dividend for those shareholders that exercise the right, and that the right itself (which has value and may in some cases be traded or renounced) is not a taxable dividend. The policy rationale for ensuring that rights and discounted shares issued under a rights issue are not treated as dividends is that the company does not give up anything of value. A rights issue involves the company raising new equity when the shareholders invest new funds in the company. Premiums paid under bookbuild arrangements Following a rights issue, a bookbuild can take place. A bookbuild involves the rights of non-participating shareholders (who chose not to participate or were not entitled to participate) being offered to other investors who pay a premium for them. The original shareholder is paid all or part of this premium for giving up their rights. It is proposed that changes be made to make it clear that premiums paid under bookbuilds are not dividends for tax purposes. From a policy perspective, a bookbuild should not be treated as a dividend because, like a rights issue, the company does not give up anything of value. 64 Share splits A share split involves a company diluting its shareholding whereby the shareholding proportions are retained but the shareholding is split into a greater number of shares. It is proposed that an amendment be made to the definition of “bonus issue” so that share splits that involve a subdivision of shares (that takes place under the Companies Act 1993) can be excluded from the dividend definition. Currently, only bonus issues that involve the issue of new shares can be excluded from the definition of “dividend” for tax purposes. However, a subdivision of shares does not necessarily involve the issue of new shares. From a policy perspective, a share split should not be treated as a taxable dividend because the company does not give up anything of value. Furthermore, in a share split, the shareholder is generally not involved in a transaction with the company. Background The current dividend definition is based on the policy that, in general, distributions from a company to a shareholder should be taxed if there is a transfer of value to the shareholder and the transfer is made in recognition of the shareholder’s ownership interest in the company (instead of, for example, an employer/employee relationship between the company and shareholder). Currently, there are views that the legislation is unclear on whether the transactions described above fall within the definition of “dividend”. The proposed changes do not involve a change in policy but are being made to clarify the policy intent for the specified transactions. 65 FARMERS’ RIPARIAN PLANTING (Clauses 20 and 21) Summary of proposed amendments Section DO 2, which presently deals with the planting of trees for certain purposes, is being extended to allow an immediate deduction for expenditure on plantings (plants or trees) to mitigate the detrimental effects on a water-course from the discharge of farming or agricultural contaminants. It is officials’ view that this merely confirms farming current practice. A consequential amendment to the heading in section DO 1 is also proposed. Application date The amendment will be effective from the 2011–12 income year, except if the taxpayer has claimed such expenditure in an earlier period and that deduction is grandparented. 66 PRIMARY SECTOR BUSINESSES AND AMORTISABLE ASSETS (Clauses 18 and 23) Summary of proposed amendment The bill contains amendments to better align the amortisation rules for primary sector businesses (farming, aquaculture, horticulture and forestry) with the general depreciation rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date The amendment allowing primary sector businesses to claim deductions for the removal cost of subpart DO improvements will apply from the beginning of the 2010–11 income year. The amendment to the capital contribution rules will apply from the beginning of the 2011–12 income year. Key features The proposed amendments will:  allow primary sector businesses to claim deductions for the cost to remove subpart DO improvements, as well as the tax book value of the improvements, that have been rendered useless, if it is caused by an action outside the control of the taxpayer; and  amend the capital contribution rules, so they apply to payments that contribute towards an amortisable asset. Background The kiwifruit Psa (Pseudomonas syringae pv actinidiae) virus has had a significant impact on New Zealand’s gold kiwifruit industry. As a consequence, a number of kiwifruit gold orchards have been or will be destroyed. The effect of the virus has highlighted several minor technical problems with the tax rules. Detailed analysis Amortisation deductions for removal cost expenditure The Income Tax Act 2007 allows primary sector businesses to amortise the costs of certain capital expenditure that are not expressly depreciable. This is similar to a taxpayer’s entitlement to claim depreciation on fixed assets. Specifically, and subject to certain criteria, when an orchardist removes a horticultural plant, the orchardist generally receives a deduction for the net tax book carrying value of the horticultural plant. 67 However, the extra cost of removing a horticultural plant is capital in nature and the Income Tax Act 2007 does not explicitly provide a deduction for these costs. In contrast, when a taxpayer with a capital asset (for example, an item of physical plant or machinery) writes that item off, the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction for the tax book carrying value, and a deduction for the costs of physically removing the item. The Psa virus has also highlighted an anomaly in the tax treatment of primary-sector improvements to land, damaged by natural events. For example, if a natural event such as a flood, damages an orchard’s infrastructure (for example, trellising and wire) the orchardist would be allowed a deduction for the tax book carrying value of the infrastructure. On the other hand, if an orchardist’s infrastructure is rendered useless due to the Psa virus (which only affects the fruit) and they wish to change the crops that they grow, the cost of removing the infrastructure and the tax book carrying value of the infrastructure once it is removed, is considered to be capital expenditure or a loss, and is therefore non-deductible. The lack of a provision for these types of costs was unintended, and accordingly the bill will amend section DO 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007, to explicitly allow a deduction for these removal costs, where improvements to the land have been rendered useless, if it is caused by an action outside the control of the taxpayer. Capital contribution rules and amortisable assets If a person receives a subsidy (or similar payment) as compensation and the subsidy is used to acquire depreciable property, the receipt is dealt with under the “capital contribution rules” in the Income Tax Act 2007. The capital contribution rules prevent a person claiming deductions for expenditure for which they have not borne the cost. Kiwifruit orchardists affected by the Psa virus may receive non-governmental financial assistance, and some of these payments may be used to subsidise the cost of replanting. However, the capital contribution rules do not presently apply to these receipts, because the capital cost of replanting does not result in depreciable property, but rather “amortisable assets”. When the capital contribution rules were implemented, capturing contributions towards assets that were amortisable under subpart DO of the Income Tax Act 2007 was not considered. This is inconsistent with the policy intent of the capital contribution rules, and the bill introduces an amendment to explicitly provide that the capital contribution rules apply where the relevant asset is amortisable, as well as where it is depreciable, so that taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for costs they have not in fact incurred. 68 GENERAL INSURANCE CLAIMS RESERVES AND EVENTS THAT OCCURRED BEFORE JULY 1993 (Clauses 2(3) and (4), 8, 25, 101 and 104) Summary of proposed amendment A technical change is proposed to the rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 that calculate a general insurer’s outstanding claims reserve – sections CR 4 and DW 4. The change explicitly excludes from the calculation certain insurance events that occurred before 1 July 1993. Application date The changes will apply from 1 April 2008, the date the tax and financial reporting treatment of general insurance outstanding claims reserve calculation were aligned. Consequential changes are also being made to the 2004 Income Tax Act for earlier income years starting from 2006. Key features The change clarifies the interaction between the:  rules for calculating an insurer’s outstanding claims reserve; and  taxation of offshore insurance business carried on by New Zealand-resident insurers before July 1993. Background Before July 1993, general insurance business carried on outside New Zealand was not subject to New Zealand income tax. As a result, New Zealand insurers were unable to claim deductions in respect of any claims that were connected with this offshore business. From 1 July 1993 insurance business carried on outside New Zealand by New Zealand residents was brought to tax. Specific transitional rules were included in the Income Tax Act 1976 to deal with the change. The transitional rules deny insurers a deduction for any pre-1993 claims – see section DZ 10. The rules for calculating the outstanding claims reserve do not explicitly exclude amounts relating to pre-1993 events and arguably track claims when an entitlement to a tax deduction for the claim does not exist under DZ 10. This outcome was not contemplated and appears to impose an unnecessary requirement on taxpayers to track insurance events when under the transitional rules no deduction would be allowed for a claim that is connected with a pre-July 1993 event. 69 TRANSITIONAL IMPUTATION PENALTY TAX (Clause 71) Summary of proposed amendment As a result of the recent company tax rate change from 30% to 28%, relief is being provided to prevent the overreach of transitional imputation penalty tax. The penalty will not apply to dividends if they were paid out before the earlier of either the 2010–11 tax return being filed or 31 March 2012 (the deadline for filing 2010–11 tax returns). Application date The amendment will apply from 1 October 2010. Key features Relief is being provided to prevent the overreach of transitional imputation penalty tax following the change in the company tax rates from 30% to 28%. Under the proposed amendment, the penalty will not apply if dividends were paid out before the earlier of either the 2010–11 tax return being filed or 31 March 2012 (the deadline for filing 2010–11 tax returns). The amendment is similar to the relief provided during the previous transitional period (when the company tax rate was reduced from 33% to 30%) and is consistent with the original policy intent of the transitional imputation penalty tax. Background As part of the company tax rate change from 30% to 28%, companies have approximately two years to pay out their 30/70 (or 33/67 credits at 30/70) imputation credits. During this “transitional period”, companies have the option to impute any credits at the old ratio of 30/70 or at the new ratio of 28/72. As part of this transitional period, a one-off transitional imputation penalty tax was put in place. The penalty is designed to ensure that companies do not excessively over-impute dividends during the transitional period, and to protect the tax base. This one-off penalty will be effective for balances as at 31 March 2013. However, the transitional imputation penalty tax overreaches in some cases. Some companies that paid the dividends before the company tax rate changed on 1 April 2011 or before their 2010–11 tax return was filed and prepaid tax to fully impute to the extent allowed at that time, cannot avoid the penalty, even though any over-imputation was, on the face of it, not deliberate. This problem was identified during the previous transitional period (when the company tax rate was reduced from 33% to 30%), and relief was provided on the basis that the penalty should not apply if there was no intentional over-imputation. 70 DEDUCTIBILITY OF REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE ON COMMERCIAL FIT-OUT (Clause 14) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment clarifies when expenditure is deductible as repairs and maintenance when it is incurred on items of commercial fit-out. It removes an unintended policy outcome arising from an earlier decision to allow depreciation for commercial building fit-out. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features New section DA 5 ensures that the replacement or improvement of a previously separately depreciated item of commercial fit-out is capitalised and depreciated over its estimated useful life. Expenditure on repairs and maintenance of an item of commercial fit-out will remain immediately deductible. Background The decision to allow building fit-out to be depreciable property introduced a new definition of building which conflicted with an existing, related definition. This was an oversight which produced an unintended policy outcome that may have allowed the replacement of an item of commercial fit-out to be deductible as repairs and maintenance. Without an amendment, this oversight could be exploited to claim immediate deductions for expenditure on commercial fit-out that should be capitalised and depreciated over its estimated useful life. 71 GST: LOCAL AUTHORITIES Repeal of sections 19A(1)(a)(ii) and 19AB (Clauses 80 and 81) Summary of proposed amendment These parts of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) are being repealed to reflect the fact that from 1 July 2013, the eight local authorities named in the Goods and Services Tax Act (Local Authorities Accounting on Payments Basis) Order 2009 will no longer be eligible to account for GST on a payments basis. Application date The amendment in clause 81 will apply from the date of enactment. The amendment in clause 80 will apply from 1 July 2013. Key features Section 19AB of the GST Act sets out that the Governor-General may specify a local authority which may continue to account for tax on a payments basis. As the only eight local authorities which are currently permitted to account for GST on a payments basis will be required to account for GST on an invoice basis from 1 July 2013, this section is no longer required. Section 19A(1)(a)(ii) sets out that a local authority specified in an Order in Council made under section 19AB may account for GST on a payments basis. As the current Order expires on 30 June 2013, and no further Orders will be made, section 19A(1)(a)(ii) will no longer be relevant after 30 June 2013. Background The Goods and Services Tax Act (Local Authorities Accounting on Payments Basis) Order 2009 expires on 30 June 2013. The eight local authorities named in the Order will not be permitted to account for GST on a payments basis after it expires as the Order is not being extended. 72 Local authorities transitional provision (Clause 95) Summary of proposed amendment Clause 95 sets out the transitional provision which will apply to the eight local authorities named in the Goods and Services Tax Act (Local Authorities Accounting on Payments Basis) Order 2009. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features When a registered person changes from a payments basis to an invoice basis, section 19C sets out that they must perform a wash-up calculation based on their outstanding debtors and creditors at that time. The eight local authorities named in the Goods and Services Tax Act (Local Authorities Accounting on Payments Basis) Order 2009 will be required to change to an invoice basis when the Order expires. The bill contains a transitional provision which will allow those local authorities to spread payment of the amount calculated as a result of that wash-up calculation over 72 months. The 72- month period will begin on 1 July 2013. If any of the local authorities choose to change to an invoice basis before 1 July 2013, they must perform the wash-up calculation based on their debtors and creditors at the end of the day before they change. Payment of this sum may still be spread over 72 months, again commencing from 1 July 2013. No interest or penalties will be imposed as a result of the local authorities spreading this payment. Background The GST Act was amended, with effect from 1 July 2001, to remove local authorities as a class of people who could account for GST on a payments basis. This eliminated the need for a dual system of accounting: an invoice system for financial reports and a payments system for GST purposes. Since that time, three consecutive temporary exemptions have been made, the cumulative effect of which has been to allow eight local authorities until 30 June 2013 to prepare for the change to an invoice basis. From 1 July 2013 all local authorities are required to account for GST on an invoice basis. The transitional provision is proposed to mitigate the significant cashflow implications which are likely to arise for the local authorities if they had to pay the sum determined by the wash-up calculation in one hit. 73 Amendment to section 19C (Clause 82) Summary of proposed amendment Section 19C is being amended to include a reference to the proposed transitional provision for local authorities. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features A reference to the proposed transitional provision for local authorities will be included in section 19C to clarify that the local authorities will be required to perform the wash- up calculation as set out in section 19C(3). Background Section 19C sets out that registered persons who change their accounting basis must perform a wash-up calculation in respect of the change. It currently refers to every registered person whose accounting basis is changed pursuant to section 19 or 19A of the GST Act. The eight local authorities which will be changing to an invoice basis on 1 July 2013 will not technically be changing their accounting basis pursuant to 19 or 19A, but rather as a result of the requirement in the new transitional provision that they account on an invoice basis. 74 GST: TREATMENT OF CASH PRIZES FOR PRIZE COMPETITIONS (Clauses 74, 75, 76 and 77) Summary of proposed amendments Section 10 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is being amended so that organisers of prize competitions will be able to deduct cash prizes from the total proceeds received for a prize competition when determining the consideration made for that supply. Sections 5 and 9 will be consequently amended to include references to prize competitions. A definition of “prize competition” will also be included in section 2. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features These amendments will restore the position which existed for prize competitions before 1 July 2004, and extend the ability to deduct cash prizes to a wider range of competitions for which participants pay money to enter, and stand to win cash prizes. While this amendment uses the term “prize competition”, the phrase is given a slightly wider meaning than it has under the Gambling Act 2003 to include analogous competitions (for example, amateur sporting competitions) that are not covered by that Act. Drafting changes will also be made to section 10(14) to make it easier to understand. Background Before 1 July 2004, when determining the consideration of a supply, organisers of prize competitions were able to deduct cash prizes from the total proceeds collected for that supply. The wording in the GST Act which permits cash prizes to be deducted was amended, effective from 1 July 2004, to use wording in the Gambling Act 2003. The wording in the GST Act had previously been based on terms contained in the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977 which the Gambling Act replaced. Some of the phrases and definitions contained in the Gambling Act are materially different from those which appeared in the Gaming and Lotteries Act. The phrase which is currently used in the relevant GST Act provisions is “gambling (including a New Zealand lottery)”. This is a narrower term than the collection of terms that was used before 1 July 2004, and does not include prize competitions. 75 GST: ADDING AN OPT-OUT PROVISION TO AGENCY RULES (Clauses 88 and 93) Summary of proposed amendments The amendment will allow principals and agents to agree to “opt-out” of the agency rules in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. A new subsection is being consequently added to the bad debts rules in section 26. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendment will allow principals and their agents to agree to “opt-out” of the agency rules in the GST Act, and permit each to issue a tax invoice in relation to what will be treated as two separate supplies. The principal will return output tax in respect of the tax invoice issued to the agent, and the agent will return output tax in respect of the tax invoice to the recipient and claim input tax in respect of the output tax charged by the principal. The proposed amendment also requires a principal who normally accounts for tax payable on a payments basis to account on an invoice basis in respect of their supply to the agent. A new subsection will also be added to the bad debts rules to prevent a principal from claiming a bad debt deduction when they use the new opt-out provision if the agent has received payment for the supply. The subsection which requires a principal to account on an invoice basis is not limited to situations where the recipient does not pay the agent. Such a limitation would require the principal to know in advance whether the agent would be paid for their supply to the recipient, and so would be unworkable. The requirement for a principal to account for the tax payable on the first supply on an invoice basis is intended to prevent a revenue loss to the Government if the agent defaults on their GST obligation. Background The GST Act currently only allows one tax invoice to be issued when an agent makes a taxable supply for, and on behalf of, a principal. Some accounting systems, however, automatically issue invoices when goods and services are supplied. The principal’s accounting system might therefore issue a tax invoice when goods and services are provided to the agent, and the agent’s accounting system might also issue a tax invoice when goods and services are provided to the recipient. There is therefore a technical breach of the legislation. Without this amendment, taxpayers will have to adapt their accounting systems to avoid this situation, and are likely to incur significant compliance costs in doing so. 76 GST RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS (Clause 94) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being made to align the record-keeping provisions in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 with proposed new amendments in the record-keeping provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 that:  allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to authorise the storage of a taxpayer’s income tax records offshore through applications from their data storage provider; and  allow the Commissioner to impose reasonable conditions for that authorisation. Application date The amendment will apply retrospectively to align with the proposed record-keeping provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994, which will apply from the date of enactment of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Key features Generally taxpayers are required to store their records in New Zealand. As taxpayers are increasingly managing their tax obligations through payroll or accounting software, the use of offshore data storage for information, records and returns is growing. Proposed changes in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Bill will give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the ability to authorise an Inland Revenue-approved data storage provider to store a taxpayer’s records offshore. These changes only apply to income tax and certain other records and not GST records. The proposed amendment will also align the GST record-keeping provisions with the Tax Administration Act changes so that an Inland Revenue-approved data storage provider can keep a person’s (who is registered for GST) records offshore. Background The proposed amendments in the Tax Administration Act have been developed to make it easier for taxpayers to conduct their tax compliance activities electronically. Inland Revenue will provide administrative criteria for the authorisation, which will outline the standards required of the data storage providers. In the absence of such an amendment for the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, a registered person would have to apply on an individual basis to the Commissioner for approval to keep their GST records offshore, even though they would not need to do so for income tax and certain other purposes. 77 Updating the record-keeping rules in this way should also assist with administering the amended GST registration rules for non-residents (also discussed in this Commentary), which are likely to result in an increased number of non-resident businesses registering for GST. 78 REPEAL OF SECTION 2(4) OF THE TAX ADMININSTRATION ACT 1994 (Clause 63) Summary of proposed amendment Section 2(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being repealed. Section 2(4) specifies that provisions in the Tax Administration Act that correspond to provisions in the Income Tax Act 1976 do not apply generally to any of the Inland Revenue Acts other than the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Section 2(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be repealed. This means that provisions which originated in the Income Tax Act 1976 will now generally apply to the Inland Revenue Acts. Background Under section 2(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, provisions that correspond to provisions of the Income Tax Act 1976 do not generally apply to any of the Inland Revenue Acts other than the Income Tax Acts. This provision was transitional in nature and applied because many of the sections of the Tax Administration Act 1994 originated from the Income Tax Act 1976, and such provisions applied only to income tax. However, in 1996 the definition of “tax” in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 was substituted and is no longer restricted to income tax. In conjunction with the replacement of other parts of the Tax Administration Act 1994, such as disputes and penalties with provisions that apply to all tax types, this means that section 2(4) is now spent. 79 REMOVING THE REMNANTS OF DEPRECIATION LOADING (Clauses 22 and 60) Summary of proposed amendment As part of Budget 2010, it was announced that depreciation loading would be removed on a prospective basis from 21 May 2010. Depreciation loading was a policy that increased the amortisation rate of most depreciable assets by 20%. When depreciation loading was first introduced, a 20% loading was also applied to two special amortisation regimes: one that applies to certain horticultural plants and one that applies to certain land improvements made by a person involved in an agricultural business (such as a farmer). Due to an oversight, this loading was not removed from these two special regimes as part of Budget 2010. To correct this, it is proposed that this loading be removed on a prospective basis from the date the bill is introduced. Taxpayers who have purchased or planted, or were committed to purchasing or planting, relevant assets or plants on or before this date will continue to be able to apply the loading. The loading will cease to apply to assets purchased thereafter. This application date is necessary to prevent taxpayers from bringing forward expenditure on relevant assets or plants to take advantage of the loading before its repeal. Note that the amortisation rate for the regressing and fertilising of pasture (schedule 20, part A, row 2) is not being changed as it does not have the loading. Application date The amendment will apply on a prospective basis from the day the bill is introduced. 80 KIWISAVER AND VOLUNTARY BONDING SCHEME PAYMENTS (Clause 96) Summary of proposed amendment Payments from voluntary bonding schemes administered by the Ministries of Health, Education and Primary Industries are to be excluded from the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Therefore, the requirements in the principal Act to make employee deductions and employer contributions will not apply to voluntary bonding scheme payments. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Section 4 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 will be amended to exclude from the definition of “salary and wages” a payment under a voluntary bonding scheme that is funded by the Ministry for Primary Industries, the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of Education. Background Three voluntary bonding schemes were established by the Government in 2009. They are administered by the Ministry for Primary Industries (previously the Ministry of Agriculture), the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education. The schemes seek to encourage recent graduates to work in hard-to-staff specialities and geographical locations within the relevant industries. Payments are available for up to five years for doctors, nurses, midwives, teachers and veterinarians who work in specified areas. The intention is that the payment amounts (after tax) will be used by the applicants to reduce their remaining student loan debt. Detailed analysis For applicants who are employees, the voluntary bonding scheme payments are income in connection with employment and fall within the definition of “extra pay” within the Income Tax Act 2007. The definition of “salary or wage” in the KiwiSaver Act 2006 includes extra pay (as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007), unless otherwise excluded. 81 Therefore, for employees, a voluntary bonding scheme payment would fall within the definition of “salary or wages” for KiwiSaver purposes. If other process requirements are met, it would be possible for a percentage of the voluntary bonding scheme payment to be treated as an employee KiwiSaver contribution, and for the employer to be required to pay a compulsory employer contribution. The employer, under the KiwiSaver Act 2006, is the person making the payment, in this case the relevant Ministry administering the scheme. This is an unintended consequence of the specific treatment of the payment under the Income Tax Act 2007 and is contrary to the policy intention that the voluntary bonding scheme be a payment towards the applicant’s student loan debt. The KiwiSaver Act 2006 provides exemptions for specific government payments that are caught under the broad definition of salary and wages in the Income Tax Act 2007 but where there is not an employment relationship between the payer and the recipient. For example, payments of the unemployment benefit and student allowance are not subject to KiwiSaver requirements due to an exemption from the definition of salary or wages. The bill proposes a similar exemption for the voluntary bonding scheme payments. 82 PROVISIONS RELATING TO OVERSEAS BENEFITS (Clauses 11, 39, 57 (21, 22, 27) and 108) Summary of proposed amendment This bill rationalises some provisions relating to overseas benefits in the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features This bill proposes to simplify some provisions relating to overseas benefits in the Income Tax Act 2007 particularly the interaction with the Social Security Act 1964. The amendments will not reduce any person’s entitlements. Background Currently, section CW 28 of the Income Tax Act 2007 exempts an overseas benefit from income tax to the extent that section 70 of the Social Security Act 1964 applies. These tax exemptions are still relevant but their interaction with the Social Security Act 1964 is complex and can be simplified. Some provisions also need updating as they are now spent. For example, the references to the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990 (which mostly relates to national superannuation and the veteran’s pension) in some provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 are no longer necessary because most parts of the former Act are now spent. 83 TAX CONCESSIONS FOR CERTAIN NON-RESIDENT COMPANIES (Clauses 38, 57 (13) (23) and 109) Summary of proposed amendment The bill repeals residual tax concessions for certain non-resident investment companies in the Income Tax Act 2007 as they are now outdated and could pose a risk to the tax base. Application date The amendment will apply from the 2013–14 income year. Key features The residual tax concessions for certain non-resident investment companies in the Income Tax Act 2007 are being repealed; related Orders in Council are also being revoked. The concessions have outlived their original purpose and are now inconsistent with a broad-base, low-rate tax framework. Moreover, retaining the tax concessions poses a revenue risk. Background The Income Tax Act 2007 provides residual tax concessions for certain non-resident companies investing in projects that are specified in four Orders in Council. The main concession relates to interest derived by these non-resident investment companies from specified projects. The income tax on interest derived by a non-resident investment company from a specified project is limited to the lower of the New Zealand company tax rate and the tax rate imposed in the non-resident company’s home country. This is done by providing a tax credit for the amount (if any) by which the New Zealand company tax exceeds the amount of home tax. A similar concession applies for dividends derived by a non-resident investment company from specified projects. The interest paid to the non-resident investment company from these specified projects is also exempt from non-resident withholding tax. The tax concessions for non-resident investment companies were generally repealed in 1995 as they were considered inconsistent with a broad-base, low-rate tax system, and were considered to be largely redundant in light of international tax reforms at that time. However, the concessionary rules were grandparented for the four Orders in Council then in force. The Orders in Council are:  Income Tax (Non-resident Investment Companies) Order 1970;  Income Tax (Non-resident Investment Companies) Order 1972;  Income Tax (Non-resident Investment Companies) Order (No 2) 1972; and  Income Tax (Non-resident Investment Companies) Order (No 3) 1974. 84 AMENDMENT TO STAMP AND CHEQUE DUTIES ACT 1971 (Clause 93) Summary of proposed amendment The Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012 replaced section 86I of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. This change was to accommodate a zero rate of AIL for retail bonds that are traded in New Zealand. However the replacement of section 86I failed to incorporate a 2010 amendment that clarified that AIL could be paid for the purposes of “an exemption under a double tax agreement”. The bill reinstates this 2010 amendment. Application date The proposed amendment will apply from 7 May 2012, the date that the Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act replaced section 86I. 85 TECHNICAL CHANGES (Clauses 12, 13, 102 and 103) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment makes minor technical changes to the Income Tax Acts 2004 and 2007 to correct an unintended change following the rewrite of the Income Tax Act 1994. The amendment restores the rules to the original position so that payments and services provided to Members of Parliament (MPs) so they can carry out their Parliamentary duties are taxed only to the extent of any private benefit, rather than in full. Application date The provision will apply from 1 April 2005. Key features Sections CW 31 and CX 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 relating to services for MPs and their predecessors (sections CW 25 and CX 11 of the Income Tax Act 2004) will be amended so that only the private element of any payment provided to MPs under the Civil List Act 1979 will be taxed and not the full amount. Background Under the Civil List Act 1979, MPs are provided with certain services and payments so they can carry out their Parliamentary duties. However, an inadvertent consequence of the fringe benefit tax provisions being rewritten is that the full amount of any such payment is treated as a fringe benefit and taxed, not just the amount relating to any private element of the service in question. This would mean that payments and services provided to MPs would be taxed more harshly than other taxpayers. The anomaly in the tax legislation is already being corrected prospectively through the Members of Parliament (Remuneration and Services) Bill. However, that amendment is prospective only. A retrospective amendment is also required to the Income Tax Acts 2004 and 2007 provisions relating to services for MPs under the Civil List Act 1979, effective from 1 April 2005, the date of the rewritten legislation. Without such an amendment, there would be unintended tax consequences for this earlier period. 86 REWRITE ADVISORY PANEL AMENDMENTS The following amendments reflect the recommendations of the Rewrite Advisory Panel following its consideration of submissions on the rewritten Income Tax Acts. The Panel monitors the working of the 2007 Income Tax Act and reviews submissions on what may be unintended changes in the law as a result of its having been rewritten. The Panel recommends legislative action, when necessary, to correct any problems. Application dates Unless otherwise stated all the amendments will apply retrospectively, with effect from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Minor maintenance items The following amendments relate to minor maintenance items referred to the Rewrite Advisory Panel as minor maintenance items and retrospectively correct any of the following:  ambiguities;  compilation errors;  cross-references;  drafting consistency, including readers’ aids – for example, the defined terms lists;  grammar;  punctuation;  spelling;  consequential amendments arising from substantive rewrite amendments; or  the consistent use of terminology and definitions. Application dates In the table below, amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 (ITA) apply from the beginning of the 2005–06 income year. Clause Section Act Amendment 27 105 EC 7 EC 7 ITA 2007 ITA 2004 Clarifying the drafting to resolve ambiguity. 32 106 EE 60 EE 51 ITA 2007 ITA 2004 Clarifying the drafting to resolve ambiguity. 36 HA 33 ITA 2007 Correction of a cross-reference. 37 LK 1 ITA 2007 Clarifying the drafting to resolve ambiguity. 45 RD 60 ITA 2007 Correction of a cross-reference. 58 Schedule 3 ITA 2007 Insert a cross-reference. 87 REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS FOR INLAND REVENUE’S ACCESS AND SEIZURE POWERS (Clauses 64, 65, and 110) Summary of proposed amendments Inland Revenue’s search and seizure powers in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Schedule to the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 are to be amended to ensure that the powers are appropriate and harmonised between the two Acts. Application date The amendments will apply immediately after the items relating to the Tax Administration Act 1994 in the Schedule of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 come into force, or on 1 April 2014, whichever is first. Key features To ensure that Inland Revenue’s access and seizure powers in the Tax Administration Act 1994 fit into the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 framework appropriately, it is proposed to insert some cross-references into the Tax Administration Act 1994. Those provisions need to be reflected in the Schedule of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012. Therefore, amendments are proposed to both the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Schedule to the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 to ensure that the powers are harmonised between the two Acts, as a remedial matter.

The paper suggested various changes to bring a wider set of salary substitutes into income for tax and social assistance purposes. Cabinet considered feedback on those suggestions and announced its decisions in October. The proposed changes in the bill give effect to those decisions. Conceptually, anything that an employer provides to an employee that is salary or wages, or is a substitute for salary or wages, should be taxed, subject to the practicality of doing so. Currently, salary and wages are treated as employment income and are subject to withholding tax (PAYE), while most non-cash benefits received as a result of employment are treated as fringe benefits and are subject to fringe benefit tax (FBT). The overall effect of PAYE and FBT is intended to be the same, so that cash and non- cash benefits are taxed equivalently. In many instances, benefits gained in a salary trade-off, such as the availability of an employer-provided vehicle, are taxed through the FBT rules. There are, however, instances in which neither a salary substitute, nor the salary traded off are taxed. A key example of this is a parking space provided on the employer’s premises. Furthermore, many non-cash benefits provided as part of a salary trade-off are not currently included in the definition of “family scheme income”, and are therefore not taken into account in determining social assistance entitlements and obligations. A key principle of tax policy is horizontal equity – ideally a tax should apply equally to people on the same effective income. The proposed rules enhance the integrity of the tax and social assistance systems, meaning greater fairness between those who receive non-cash benefits as part of their remuneration, and those who receive only cash remuneration. The new rules balance achieving a more equitable and efficient outcome against the compliance cost associated with doing so. For compliance reasons, the rules therefore primarily focus on the largest benefits which are currently not taxed. Many submitters indicated that they would prefer a simple rule focussed on the most obvious salary trade-off situations. However, it soon became apparent that such a rule would likely be impractical to apply. There would be a strong risk that it would lose its effectiveness as taxpayers altered their arrangements over time by, for example, switching away from salary trade-offs that explicitly offer a cash alternative. Therefore, to achieve a robust solution the proposed approach has needed to cover both implicit and explicit salary trade-offs and to provide detailed rules about what situations are covered. 4 Key changes There are two key areas of change. The first involves taxing a wider set of car parks, through the FBT rules. The new rules would apply predominantly to car parks provided to employees in the central business districts of Auckland and Wellington (the areas where the benefits to employees are the greatest). A parking space provided to an employee outside of those defined areas would also be included if the parking space was supplied to the employer for more than $210 per month, or if the employee had explicitly traded off an amount of employment income for the parking space. The new rules replace the current on-premises/off-premises distinction for determining whether a parking space is subject to FBT. Difficult interpretive issues are raised by the need to distinguish between parking benefits which are provided on the employer’s premises and parking benefits which are not. The second major change is to include explicit salary trade-offs involving vehicles and parking spaces, as well as vouchers (such as grocery or petrol vouchers) in the definition of “income” used when calculating social assistance entitlements and obligations. Other changes include clarifying that the charitable organisations’ FBT exemption will not, subject to the minimum thresholds, extend to vouchers. Application date All amendments will apply from 1 April 2014. 5 WHEN A PARKING SPACE MAY BE A FRINGE BENEFIT (Clauses 12C, 12D, 13B and 13D) Summary of proposed amendments The following changes are proposed:  Clause 12C will remove the provision of motor vehicle parking from the category of “unclassified benefits”.  Clause 12D will set out a new rule which determines when the provision of a parking space to an employee is a fringe benefit.  Clause 13B will remove the provision of motor vehicle parking from the “on- premises” FBT exemption.  Clause 13D will further set out that a benefit in the form of the availability of an area for parking a motor vehicle is not a fringe benefit, other than as described in the new rules in clause 12D. Key features The proposed amendments will widen the range of taxable parking benefits. They will remove the distinction between parking benefits which are provided on the employer’s premises and car park benefits which are not provided on-premises. They will also ensure that car park benefits outside of the new rules will not be treated as a fringe benefit. Under the current rules, benefits that are provided by an employer and used or consumed by the employee on the premises of the employer are exempt from FBT. Clause 13B will remove the provision of motor vehicle parking from this “on-premises” exemption. To ensure that a range of car park benefits do not become unintentionally taxable as a result of this change, clause 13D clarifies that a benefit in the form of the availability of an area for parking a motor vehicle is not a fringe benefit, except as set out in proposed section CX 9B (clause 12D). Given the specific car park rules in new section CX 9B, clause 12C clarifies that the provision of motor vehicle parking is no longer an unclassified fringe benefit. Proposed section CX 9B sets out when the availability of a parking space will constitute a fringe benefit. This will only happen if an employer makes a parking space available in any of the following situations:  The parking space is in a specified urban area. These areas are the central business districts of Auckland and Wellington and are marked as the “Central Area” on the respective District Plans. The provisions in the Supplementary Order Paper No. 167 also provide that the Governor-General may, by Order in Council, add or remove an urban area, or vary the boundaries of an urban area within which a fringe benefit may arise. 6  The parking space is provided to the employer by a commercial car park operator and the consideration paid by the employer is more than the specified amount. That specified amount is set at $210 per month. The Governor-General may, by Order in Council, vary this amount.  When the employee would be entitled to a greater amount of employment income had they chosen to not receive the parking space. The benefit is calculated on a daily basis for each employee. The tax treatment of parking spaces will differ depending on whether the space is specifically allocated to an employee. Allocated spaces Allocated spaces are those which are assigned to specific employees. A space which is specifically allocated to an employee may or may not have that employee’s name displayed on it. If a specific parking space is allocated to an employee, a fringe benefit of one parking space will arise on a day if the employer makes the space available to the employee, and the use of that space is not restricted to what the proposed provisions refer to as a “business or certificated vehicle”. The term “business or certificated vehicle” refers to vehicles which either have a valid disabled parking permit, are work-related vehicles (as defined in section CX 38 of the FBT rules), or are essentially fleet cars. In the case of a fleet car, the car has to be owned or leased by the employer, be made available to multiple employees for business purposes during business hours, and not be made available for private use of employees (other than travel which arises incidentally to travel for business purposes). Home to work travel is specifically not considered to be incidental travel. Example Company A is located on Fort Street in Auckland. One of its employees, Morgan, is allocated a parking space in the building. On weekdays she is only allowed to park the work-related vehicle which she drives in the space. During the weekend, however, she is allowed to park her own car in the space. A fringe benefit of one parking space arises on two days, Saturday and Sunday. Unallocated spaces Where spaces are not specifically allocated to employees, employees can generally park in whichever space they choose. The provisions in Supplementary Order Paper No. 167 refer to these unallocated spaces as “pool parking spaces”, and carve out spaces which are allocated to the sole use of one employee, or of people other than employees (such as spaces specifically designated for customers). The SOP refers to employees who may park in one of these pool parking spaces as “pool users”. 7 There may or may not be a sufficient number of pool parking spaces to ensure that all pool users are able to park on any given day. The provisions propose a slightly different tax treatment depending on whether there are or are not enough pool parking spaces for all pool users. This is because when there are fewer pool parking spaces than pool users, there is no certainty that a space will be available when an employee wants to park. Conversely, when the number of pool parking spaces is equal to or greater than the number of pool users, an employee can be more confident that they will be able to find a parking space. When the number of pool parking spaces is equal to or greater than the number of pool users, a fringe benefit will arise from the employer making available a pool parking space to an employee on a day, unless the employee is restricted on the day to the use of the space for a business or certificated vehicle, or is restricted to parking outside the hours 6am to 10pm. This recognises the fact that public transport may not be readily available during these hours. It also recognises the fact that two employees may be parking in the same space at different times during the day and night. Example Company B is located on Brandon Street in Wellington and provides parking for its employees. It has 20 parking spaces, but only 14 employees. One of its employees drives a vehicle with a disabled parking permit and can only park that vehicle. The other employees do not drive business or certificated vehicles. A fringe benefit arises each day for the 13 remaining employees. When the number of pool parking spaces is less than the number of pool users, the following formula is used to calculate an appropriate fraction of a parking space to assign to each employee for each day: Parking ratio x (day users – business) (day users) The formula takes into account the number of “day users”. A day user is a pool user who, on that day, has hours of employment both beginning and ending between 6am and 10pm. When employees are restricted to the use of pool parking spaces outside the hours of 6am to 10pm, no fringe benefit arises. The formula subtracts from the total number of day users the number of business users, that is, the number of day users who, on that day, are restricted to the use of a pool parking space for parking a business or certified vehicle between 6am and 10pm. This number is multiplied by a “parking ratio”. The parking ratio is 1 if the number of day users is less than or equal to the number of pool parking spaces. Otherwise, the parking ratio is the number of pool parking spaces divided by the number of day users. The resulting number is then divided by the number of day users in order to calculate a fraction that determines the fringe benefit for each employee. 8 Example Company C is located on Lambton Quay in Wellington. It has 50 parking spaces, and all 90 employees are told that they can park there. Parking works on a first-come, first-served basis. On Monday, 70 employees are rostered to work. Sixty five of them will be working from 7am until 7pm. The other five will be working from 11pm until 5am restocking merchandise. They may only park while they are working. Three of the employees working during the day are only allowed to park work-related vehicles in the parking building. Employees who are not working on Monday are not allowed to park in the parking building. The number of pool parking spaces (50) is less than the number of pool parking users (70). The number of day users is 65. As the number of day users is more than the number of pool parking spaces, the parking ratio is 50 / 65 (the number of pool parking spaces divided by the number of day users). Company C therefore calculates its fringe benefit tax liability using the formula: Parking ratio x (day users – business) (day users) 50 / 65 x (65 – 3) = 0.734 65 A fringe benefit arises on Monday for the 65 day users of a fraction of a parking space. Each of the 65 day users receives 0.734 of a parking space. No fringe benefit arises on Monday for the five employees who are restricted to using the pool parking spaces for their night time shift. No fringe benefit arises on Monday for the 20 employees who are not working on that day, because they are only allowed to park if they are working on that day. Background Most non-cash benefits provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment are fringe benefits, and are subject to fringe benefit tax. There is, however an exemption for non-cash benefits which are used or consumed on the employer’s premises, primarily for compliance reasons. Most, but not all, benefits from the availability of parking spaces are exempt from FBT because of this exemption. Difficult interpretative issues are raised by the need to distinguish between whether a parking space is or is not on an employer’s premises. The current interpretation of “premises” is based on a common law interpretation, under which a leased car park, like one owned by the employer, is exempt from FBT, whereas a licensed car park is not exempt. 9 VALUE OF CAR PARK FRINGE BENEFIT (Clause 44B) Summary of proposed amendment Proposed section RD 33B sets out the daily value for a fringe benefit which arises from the availability of a parking space. It also permits an employer to use a parking test period, and to obtain daily average figures. It further sets out that it overrides the valuation rules in section RD 41, except when an employer is a commercial car park operator. Key features Proposed section RD 33B sets out the value of a fringe benefit arising from the availability of a parking space. It sets out three different values which may apply, depending on the circumstances in which the parking space was provided. Each of these values is expressed as a daily value. When the parking space is provided by a commercial car park operator, the value of the parking space is equivalent to the amount charged by the car park operator to the employer for the parking space. This value applies regardless of where in the country the parking space is located, or whether the employee has opted to receive a smaller amount of employment income in exchange for access to the parking space. Other provisions, as noted earlier, determine what parking spaces are subject to FBT. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will also set a standard value. This value is to be used if the parking space is in the Central Area of either Auckland or Wellington and is not provided by a commercial car park operator. This value is likely to be $250 per month, converted to a daily value. It is to be used regardless of whether the employee has opted to receive a smaller amount of employment income in exchange for access to the parking space. When the parking space is not supplied to the employer by a commercial car park operator, there may be no easy way for the employer to determine the value of that parking space. The standard value is therefore intended to overcome this concern. If the parking space is not provided by a commercial car park operator, and is not in the Central Areas of Auckland or Wellington, it can only be a fringe benefit if the employee would have been entitled to a greater amount of employment income had they opted not to receive the parking space. In this case, the value of the fringe benefit is the amount of extra employment income the employee would have been entitled to, had they chosen not to receive the parking space. Normally, the fringe benefit tax will be the full daily value. However, when there are fewer pool parking spaces than pool users, an employee may have received a fraction of a parking space under proposed section CX 9B (3)(d). In that case, the value of the fringe benefit for the employee is that fraction multiplied by the appropriate daily value as set out above. 10 Section RD 54(2) already takes into account contributions made by employees in determining the value of fringe benefits. This section will also apply to parking spaces to recognise amounts paid by employees for a parking space. With one exception, proposed section RD 33B will override the valuation method set out in section RD 41. Section RD 41 is used to value services provided by an employer to an employee when those services are a fringe benefit. The valuation method set out in section RD 41 will apply if a commercial car park operator is also the employer. In such cases the daily value will be the amount the commercial car park operator charges an independent third party for a parking space. 11 PARKING TEST PERIOD (Clause 44B) Summary of proposed amendment Proposed section RD 33C sets out the requirements for a parking test period. Key features Proposed section RD 33C allows employers to record the use of parking spaces by employees for a test period in order to obtain daily average figures. The quantities from the test period can then be applied for a term of up to three years. An employer choosing to use a parking test period must choose a period which shows, or is likely to show, a pattern of the use of the parking spaces which fairly represents the use over the whole of the term. The test period must be for a continuous period of two months or more. An employer might choose a longer period, for example, if their business had large seasonal variations in numbers of employees such that any two- month period was unlikely to be typical for the year. The employer can choose to end the term before the end of the three-year period. If they do so, they cannot continue to use the test quantities they obtained during the test period. Proposed section RD 33C also sets out two other circumstances in which the employer must not continue to use the test quantities. The first is when the Commissioner gives the employer a notice informing them that the Commissioner considers the test quantities do not fairly represent the use of parking spaces. This notice will contain a date after which the employer must not continue to use the test quantities. The other situation is when, as relevant, either the number of pool parking spaces or the number of pool users exceeds the test quantity obtained for that item by 10 percent or more. An employer will only need to monitor one of these items. The value which an employer must consider is whichever of the number of pool parking spaces or the number of pool users was the smaller number when they recorded their test quantities. If, in a return period, the current number representing that item exceeds the test quantity by 10 percent or more, the employer must not continue to use the test quantities after the end of that return period. The 10 percent threshold has been chosen because it is considered to represent a significant change in circumstances and, therefore, overall FBT liability. Background Test-period provisions exist elsewhere in the Income Tax Act; for example, in the fringe benefit rules in relation to motor vehicles. 12 ATTRIBUTION OF CAR PARK FRINGE BENEFITS (Clauses 44D and 44E) Summary of proposed amendment If an employer provides a parking space to an employee and that parking space is within the ambit of proposed section CX 9B which sets out the ambit of the rules, the proposed amendment to section RD 47 requires the employer to attribute the benefit to that employee. Clause 44E proposes to amend section RD 48 so that when making a parking space available to multiple employees, an employer does not have to attribute the benefit to the employee who mainly uses or receives the benefit. It further allows employers to pool the value of benefits, if the formula in section CX 9B (3)(d) applies to the benefits. Key features Employers are required to attribute certain fringe benefits to employees. These fringe benefits are set out in section RD 47 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Clause 44D proposes to add the provision of a parking space which is covered by proposed section CX 9B to this list of attributable items, irrespective of the value of the benefit. Employers will still be able to choose to pay FBT at a single higher rate if they choose. Furthermore, when the benefit is an unallocated parking space where there are fewer spaces than employees (so that section CX 9B(3)(d) applies), the employer will have the choice of attributing the fraction of a parking space to the individual employee or pooling the benefits under section RD 53. Clause 44E also proposes an amendment to section RD 48 so that employers are not required to determine which employee mainly uses or receives the benefit of a parking space. This is relevant when an employer does not allocate parking spaces to specific employees. Background Attribution enables the employer to pay fringe benefit tax at a level which reflects the employees’ specific tax rates. Section RD 48 currently sets out that if an employer provides a fringe benefit (which must be attributed) to more than one employee, they must attribute the benefit to the employee who mainly uses or receives the benefit. It further states that if the employer cannot determine which employee mainly uses or receives the benefit they must pool that benefit. Under section RD 48, if an employer cannot determine which employee mainly uses or receives a benefit they must pool the benefit (under section RD 53). The tax rates required to be used under this pooling section may be higher than the tax rates of the employees actually receiving the benefits. 13 POWER TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS ON CAR PARK VALUE (Clause 67C) Summary of proposed amendment The provisions in this Supplementary Order Paper No. 167 give the Commissioner the power to make determinations on the value of a fringe benefit arising from the availability to an employee of a parking space in the Central Areas of Auckland and Wellington. Key features The amendment (proposed section 91AAT of the Tax Administration Act) will allow the Commissioner to determine the value of the availability of a car parking space in the Central Areas of Auckland and Wellington. The determination may apply for a period of time specified in that determination. Within 30 days of issuing or changing a determination, the Commissioner must publish a notice in a publication chosen by the Commissioner which gives notice that the determination has been issued or changed, and states where copies of the determination can be obtained. This Commissioner power will extend to other urban areas should they be added by Order in Council to the list of specified areas. The Commissioner must take market rates for parking spaces into account in determining an appropriate value for the urban area. Background As set out in proposed section RD 33B, the daily value of the availability of a parking space will sometimes be the amount set by a determination of the Commissioner. This will occur when the parking space is not provided by a commercial car park operator, but is located within the Central Areas of Auckland and Wellington, as set out in the respective District Plans of those cities. When the parking space is not supplied to the employer by a commercial car park operator, there may be no easy way for the employer to determine the value of the car park. The reason for using a value set by the Commissioner is, therefore, intended to resolve this issue. 14 SHORT-TERM CHARGE FACILITIES AND FRINGE BENEFIT TAX (Clauses 13C and 44C) Summary of proposed amendments Section CX 25 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be amended to clarify that vouchers are a form of short-term charge facility. Section CX 25 will also be amended to cap the threshold under which a benefit provided by a charitable organisation in relation to a short-term charge facility does not constitute a fringe benefit. Key features Definition clarification Section CX 25 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be amended to clarify that vouchers are a form of short-term charge facility. Comparable changes will be made to section RD 39 that sets out the value of short-term charge facilities. It will be amended to include an amount that an organisation pays for or towards consideration, other than money or money’s worth for the goods and services obtained by an employee under the short-term charge facility. This revised definition is also used in proposed section MB 7B. Capping the minimum threshold Currently a benefit provided to an employee of a charitable organisation by way of a short-term charge facility has to exceed 5 percent of the employee’s salary or wages for the tax year before it is treated as a fringe benefit. This threshold will be capped so that a fringe benefit will arise if the aggregate value of the short-term charge facility benefits in a tax year is more than the lesser of 5 percent of the employee’s salary or wages for the tax year, or $1,200. Background Charitable organisations are generally exempt from fringe benefit tax. Currently, one exception to this exemption is when the charitable organisation provides a benefit to an employee by way of a short-term charge facility, and the value of the benefit for the employee in a tax year is more than 5 percent of the employee’s salary or wages. The first of the proposed changes described above clarifies that if a charitable organisation provides its employees with vouchers, those arrangements will be subject to FBT unless they are below the threshold. The second change ensures that the exemption threshold is set at a level that recognises potential compliance costs but protects the revenue base. 15 FAMILY SCHEME INCOME FROM EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS (Clause 39B) Summary of proposed amendment Proposed section MB 7B will require employees who receive certain non-cash benefits to include them in their family scheme income calculations. The availability of an employer-provided parking space or motor vehicle will be included if it is part of an explicit salary trade-off – that is, if the employee would be entitled to a greater amount of employment income if they chose not to receive the non-cash benefit. An employee who receives short-term charge facilities will also be required to include these if the value of benefits received in a year is more than the specified threshold. “Family scheme income” is used to calculate entitlements and obligations for a number of different forms of social assistance. This amendment will see the above types of non- cash benefits taken into account for Working for Families tax credits, the student allowances parental income threshold, and community services card entitlements. Subsequent amendments will be made to include the same benefits in income for child support and student loan repayment purposes once the Child Support Amendment Bill and the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill (No 2) have been enacted. Proposed section MB 7B sets out the value of benefits to be included in family scheme income. These changes will affect people’s entitlements and obligations for those periods that include income derived on or after 1 April 2014. Key features New section MB 7B will only apply to persons to whom section MB 8 does not apply. Section MB 8 sets out what an employee who is also a controlling shareholder must include in their family scheme income. The rules for controlling shareholders are not being changed. If an employee receives a motor vehicle or parking space from their employer, and the employee would be entitled to a greater amount of employment income if they chose not to receive the non-cash benefit, that benefit will be included in the calculation of family scheme income, regardless of its value or where in the country the parking space is located. The amount which the employee would be required to report would be the amount by which their employment income would be greater in the absence of one of the above benefits. 16 Employees will also be required to include short-term charge facilities they have received in family scheme income in certain situations. This will only be when the value of the benefit provided under short-term charge facilities provided in an income year (not including the fringe benefit tax payable on the benefits) is more than the lesser of 5 percent of the employee’s salary or wages for the tax year, or $1,200. This threshold is included to reduce potential compliance costs. The amount the employee will be required to include will be the value of the short-term charge facilities, including any fringe benefit tax. This requirement applies to employees of all entity types, not just charitable organisations. By inserting section MB 7B, these three types of benefits will be taken into account for forms of social assistance which base their calculations on section MB. These will be Working for Families tax credits, the parental income test for student allowances, and entitlements to community services cards. Background A key principle of tax policy is horizontal equity – ideally a tax should apply equally to people on the same effective income. When a non-cash benefit is provided as a substitute for salary or wages, if it is not included in family scheme income in the way that salary or wages would be, inequity arises. This change is, therefore, designed to achieve greater fairness. The focus is on including the likely main benefits. Short-term charge facilities, such as vouchers, are included because they are a readily substitutable alternative to salary and wages even when a specific amount of cash has not been traded off. 17 FAMILY SCHEME INCOME FROM FRINGE BENEFITS, CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS (Clause 39C) Summary of proposed amendment The heading of section MB 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be amended to specifically refer to controlling shareholders. Key features A specific reference to controlling shareholders who are also employees will be added to the heading of section MB 8 of the Income Tax Act to avoid confusion with proposed section MB 7B which applies to other employees. Background Section MB 8 requires a fringe benefit which is required to be attributed to an employee who is a controlling shareholder to be included in the family scheme income of that person. 18 STATEMENT TO EMPLOYEES ON SHORT-TERM CHARGE FACILITIES PROVIDED (Clause 67B) Summary of proposed amendments Employers who provide short-term charge facilities to employees will be required to provide employees with a statement about those short-term charge facilities. Key features Including vouchers in social assistance As a result of another provision (clause 39B), employees will be required to include short-term charge facilities in their calculation of family scheme income for social assistance purposes if the value of the short-term charge facility is over the threshold. To assist employees in completing their income calculations for social assistance purposes, employers will be required to provide employees with information on the short-term charge facilities they provide to their employees. This is because employees are unlikely to keep records of all short-term charge facilities which they receive in a year. Because employers are required to pay FBT on these facilities if their value exceeds the threshold, they should have those records. Consideration was given to only requiring employers to provide statements to employees when the employer knew the threshold had been exceeded. This approach was considered to be impractical, given that an employee could receive short-term charge facilities from more than one employer during the tax year. Therefore, proposed section 46F of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires all employers who provide short-term charge facilities to employees to provide those employees with a statement about those short-term charge facilities. The statement will need to set out the threshold amount, which if breached, would result in the employee needing to include the short-term charge facilities received in their family scheme income. The statement will also need to set out the value of all benefits received from the employer from short-term charge facilities in that income year. That value should not include the amount of fringe benefit tax which the employer may have paid. If this number exceeds the threshold, then the employee will be required to include the total value of benefits they have received from short-term charge facilities (this time including the fringe benefit tax) in their family scheme income. Accordingly, the statement is therefore also required to set out the total value of benefits, including the FBT paid. 19 The statement should also set out details of each short-term charge facility provided to the employee. An employee who receives vouchers from more than one employer during the tax year will need to aggregate their benefits when carrying out the above comparison. Example Matt works for two employers, Company A and Company B, and earns $40,000 a year. They give Matt short-term charge facilities worth $700 and $650 respectively. Company A and Company B will each have to send Matt a statement about the short-term charge facilities they have given him. Background The amendment assists all employees receiving vouchers to determine whether they need to include them in their family scheme income. The requirement to include vouchers (above the minimum threshold) is part of a general widening of the definition of “family scheme income” aimed at providing greater equity between those employees who receive only salary and wages and those who receive some non-cash remuneration. Vouchers that cover everyday living expenses provide a readily substitutable alternative to salary and wages. 20 CONTRIBUTIONS PAID BY EMPLOYEES (Clause 44F) Summary of proposed amendment This clause amends section RD 54(2) so that a fringe benefit with a negative value cannot arise. Key features Section RD 54(2) sets out that if an employee pays an amount for receiving a fringe benefit, the value of the benefit is reduced by the amount paid. This amendment ensures that the net value of the benefit cannot be a negative number. 21 Lease inducement payments and lease surrender payments 22 23 OVERVIEW An officials’ issues paper, The taxation of lease inducement payments, was released in July 2012, seeking feedback on proposals to tax lease inducement payments. Lease inducement payments are unconditional lump sum cash payments generally made by landlords to induce tenants to enter into a commercial lease. For income tax purposes, these payments are typically non-taxable to a recipient (tenant) and deductible to a payer (commercial landlord). The risk identified in the issues paper was the tax asymmetry, which created an opportunity for taxpayers to substitute tax deductible rent payments with non-taxable cash lease inducement payments. Following public consultation, the Government decided to tax lease inducement payments. However, the scope of the reform was extended to include another type of lease-related payment – lease surrender payments. For income tax purposes, lease surrender payments that are generally made by tenants to landlords to surrender existing lease arrangements are typically taxable to the recipient (commercial landlord) and non- deductible to the payer (tenant). These payments are currently regarded as “black hole” expenditure to the commercial tenant – that is, non-deductible business expenditure. Measures introduced in this Supplementary Order Paper treat lease inducement payments and lease surrender payments as taxable to the recipient and tax deductible expenditure for the payer under the Income Tax Act 2007 from 1 April 2013. Generally, income and expenditure derived or incurred from these payments will be spread over the term of a lease. The proposed measures are designed to improve fairness and business efficiency by removing existing tax treatments that distort business decisions such as non-taxable lease inducement payments and non-deductible lease surrender payments. There will be a further review on the tax treatment of other commercial land-related lease payments, such as lease transfer payments. This review will consider the general tax treatment of commercial land-related lease payments, with a view to achieving a coherent and consistent tax treatment of these payments. It is expected that an officials’ issues paper will be released for public consultation early next year seeking feedback on the review. 24 THE TAX TREATMENT OF LEASE INDUCEMENT PAYMENTS AND LEASE SURRENDER PAYMENTS (Clauses 4B, 17B, 25B, 32B and 57(19B)) Summary of proposed amendments Measures introduced in this Supplementary Order Paper modify the capital-revenue boundary for two specific land-related payments, namely lease inducement payments and lease surrender payments. Lease inducement payments are unconditional lump sum cash payments generally made by landlords to induce tenants to enter into a commercial lease. Lease surrender payments are generally made by tenants to landlords to surrender existing lease arrangements. From 1 April 2013, these payments will be treated as taxable to the recipient and deductible to the payer under the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date The reform will apply to an amount that is:  derived or incurred from 1 April 2013; and  not derived or incurred as consideration for the agreement, before 1 April 2013, to a lease of land or a licence to use land. The income tax treatment of an amount derived or incurred as consideration for the agreement before 1 April 2013 to a lease of land or a licence to use land will continue to be determined under general principles and provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007. Key features There are two main groups of amendments. The first group includes amendments relating to the tax treatment of lease inducement payments, namely the charging provision (new section CC 1B), the deduction provision (new section DB 20B), and the timing provision (new section EI 4B). The second group includes amendments relating to the tax treatment of lease surrender payments, namely the charging provision (new section CC 1C) and the deduction provision (new section DB 20C). Under the amendments relating to lease inducement payments:  If a person (the payee) derives an amount as consideration for the agreement by the payee to the grant, renewal, extension, or transfer of a right (the land right) that is a leasehold estate or a licence to use land, the amount will be taxable to the payee. An amount derived by a tenant of residential premises will be specifically excluded from the charging provision (new section CC 1B). 25  A matching deduction provision will be provided. If a person (the payer) incurs an amount of expenditure as consideration for the agreement by another person (the payee) to the grant, renewal, extension, or transfer of a right (the land right) that is a leasehold estate or a licence to use land, the payer will be allowed a deduction for the amount (new section DB 20B).  A new timing rule will allocate the income and deductions from a lease inducement payment evenly over the term of the land right to which the payment relates. An exception will apply when the person ceases to hold the relevant land right, or the estate in land from which the land right is granted, during an income year. For income, the remaining amount to be spread under the general timing rule will be allocated to that income year. For deductions, the remaining amount to be spread will be allocated to that income year if the land right, and the estate in land from which the land right is granted, are not held by the person or an associated person (new section EI 4B). Under the amendments relating to lease surrender payments:  If a person (the payee) derives an amount as consideration for the agreement by the payee to the surrender of a leasehold estate or the termination of a licence to use land, the amount will be taxable to the payee. An amount derived by a tenant of residential premises will be specifically excluded from the charging provision (new section CC 1C).  A matching deduction provision will be provided. If a person (the payer) incurs an amount of expenditure as consideration for the agreement by another person (the payee) to the surrender of a leasehold estate or the termination of a licence to use land, the payer will be allowed a deduction for the amount (new section DB 20C).  There is no specific timing rule for lease surrender payments. The general principles and provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 will apply to determine the timing of income and deductions for lease surrender payments. Generally, income and deductions arising from lease surrender payments will be allocated to the income year in which the amount is derived or incurred. Background In July 2012, an officials’ issues paper, The taxation of lease inducement payments, was released which proposed to address the revenue risk posed by lease inducement payments by making them taxable. Lease inducement payments are unconditional lump sum cash payments generally paid by landlords to tenants as an inducement to enter into a commercial lease. For the recipient, the payment is generally a non-taxable capital receipt because the payment is received in relation to a lease that relates to the structure of the tenant’s business. The capital nature of a lease inducement payment was confirmed by the Privy Council in Wattie. 1 For the payer, the payment is generally tax deductible if the payer incurs the expenditure in the course of carrying on a business of leasing. 1 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wattie \[1999\] 1 NZLR 529. 26 The revenue risk identified in the issues paper was the deductible and non-taxable tax treatment of lease inducement payments in a commercial context. This created an opportunity for taxpayers to substitute tax deductible rent payments with non-taxable cash lease inducement payments. Also, compared with other forms of lease inducements such as a rent-free holiday or a contribution for fit-out costs, these payments provided a tax advantage which distorted business decisions on leases. Example A commercial landlord with premises that are used to generate $100,000 of rental income a year during an economic upturn would struggle to do so in a downturn. To induce a tenant to enter into a lease, the landlord could either reduce the rent from $100,000 to $60,000 or offer a lease inducement payment of $40,000 while maintaining the rent of $100,000. Under the latter arrangement, the landlord receives the same amount of after-tax income of $43,200 ($100,000 minus $40,000 lease inducement resulting in taxable income of $60,000 less income tax at 28%). The tenant receives the tax advantage as they do not pay income tax on the amount of lease inducement of $40,000, while claiming a tax deduction for rental income expenses of $100,000 against their income. The tenant is $11,200 (tax cash value of non- taxable lease inducement payment of $40,000 at 28%) better off than simply paying the rent of $60,000. The deduction of $40,000 extra rent shelters income of the same amount. Following public consultation, the Government decided to tax lease inducement payments as a base-protection measure. However, the scope of the reform was extended to address another existing asymmetry in the tax system that is “taxpayer- unfriendly” – the non-deductibility of lease surrender payments. Lease surrender payments are generally made by tenants to landlords to surrender existing lease arrangements. 2 Lease surrender payments are typically taxable to the landlord recipient if they are in the business of leasing, but non-deductible to the tenant payer if the lease premises relate to the structure of the tenant’s business; the latter treatment has been confirmed by the Court of Appeal in McKenzies. 3 These payments are currently regarded as “black hole” expenditure to the commercial tenant – that is, non-deductible business expenditure. This reform is limited in scope by addressing existing tax asymmetries relating only to lease inducement payments and lease surrender payments. However, there are other existing tax asymmetries in the tax system in relation to other land-related lease payments such as lease transfer payments. Currently, lease transfer payments are generally non-taxable to the commercial tenant recipient and deductible to the incoming commercial tenant under the depreciation rules. 2 Note that lease surrender payments can also be made by the landlord to secure the surrender of existing leases by tenants. 3 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v McKenzies New Zealand Limited \[1988\] 2 NZLR 736. 27 Following the limited reforms included in this Supplementary Order Paper, there will be a further review of the taxation of other commercial lease-related payments. The objective of the review is to provide a consistent and coherent tax treatment of all commercial land-related lease payments that is consistent with the broad-base, low-rate tax framework. It is expected that an officials’ issues paper will be released for public consultation early next year seeking feedback on the review. Detailed analysis The tax treatment of lease inducement payments Income New section CC 1B provides that if a person (the payee) derives an amount as a consideration for the agreement by the payee to the grant, renewal, extension or transfer of a land right, the amount will be taxable to the payee. The land right must be a right that is a leasehold estate or a licence to use land. The charging provision will not apply to an amount derived in relation to a freehold estate in land, such as the proceeds from the sale of land. However, the charging provision will apply broadly to include amounts derived in relation to leases, including subleases, and other estates or interests in land. The term “leasehold estate” is defined in section YA 1 to include any estate, however created, other than a freehold estate. An exception applies for residential tenants. A lease inducement payment is not income of the payee to the extent that the payee derives the amount as a tenant of residential premises. If there is a concurrent use of the land right for residential and business purposes, the amount will be apportioned so that only the amount relating to the business use is taxable (subsection (4)). The charging provision will apply broadly to include amounts derived in relation to the entry into an agreement for the grant, renewal, extension or a transfer of the land right. For example, the provision will apply to an amount paid by a grantor of the land right (landlord) to induce a grantee (tenant) to agree to the grant, renewal or extension of a lease. Also, an amount paid by an assignor to induce an assignee to receive an assignment of a lease will be covered by the provision. Note that the transfer of the affected land right would include both registered and unregistered transfers. The charging provision will not apply to an amount derived by the payee as the holder of a land right and as consideration for the transfer of the land right to the person paying the amount. This will exclude an amount paid by an assignee to an assignor for the transfer of an existing lease from the charging provision (subsection (2)). The charging provision will apply to any person who derives the amount in relation to the land right. If a person receives a lease inducement payment on behalf of another person, the existing nominee rules in section YB 21 will apply to treat the amount as derived by that other person. 28 The reference to “amount” in section CC 1B uses the definition of “amount” in section YA 1, which includes any amount in money’s worth. The charging provision therefore includes consideration other than cash. Deductions A matching deduction provision will provide symmetry in the tax treatment of lease inducement payments. New section DB 20B provides that lease inducement payments are deductible to a person (the payer) if the following conditions are met:  the payer incurs an amount of expenditure as consideration for the agreement by another person (the payee) to the grant, renewal, extension or transfer of a right (the land right) that is a leasehold estate or a licence to use land;  the payer is the person who owns the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted; and  the payee is the person who is obtaining the land right. Note that this deduction provision will cover other lease inducements, in particular, contributions for fit-out costs. A consequence of this is that the timing rule for deductions in new section EI 4B (discussed below) will apply to such other lease inducements. New section DB 20B overrides the capital limitation in section DA 2(1). The general permission in section DA 1 must still be satisfied and the other general limitations in section DA 2 will still apply. Timing of income and deductions New section EI 4B is a timing provision for lease inducement payments. The timing provision will allocate the amount of income under section CC 1B or deductions under section DB 20B from a lease inducement payment evenly over the term of the land right (that is, a leasehold estate or a licence to use land) to which the amount of income or deductions relates (the spreading period). The spreading period is the period after which a land right may be terminated, or expires, if not extended or renewed, that begins with the commencement, or the most recent renewal or extension, of the land right. The timing provision will spread the amount derived or incurred before the end of the spreading period evenly over the spreading period. Given lease inducement payments are generally made at the commencement of the land right, the amount will be spread evenly over the relevant land right. Even when the amount is derived or incurred before the commencement of the land right, the amount will be allocated in relation to the spreading period, not when the amount is incurred or derived. 29 Example On 1 April 2013, a tenant receives $100,000 from a landlord as consideration for the agreement to enter into a 10-year lease that commences on the same day. The tenant and the landlord both have a 31 March balance date. The tenant Under section CC 1B, $100,000 is taxable to the tenant. Under section EI 4B, the income is spread evenly over the 10-year period from the 2013–14 to the 2022–23 income years inclusive (i.e. $10,000 income is allocated to the tenant in each income year). The landlord Under section DB 20B, $100,000 is deductible for the landlord. Under section EI 4B, the deductions are spread evenly over the 10-year period from the 2013–14 to the 2022–23 income years inclusive (i.e. a deduction of $10,000 is allocated to the landlord in each income year). The timing of income and deductions under section EI 4B is affected by when the income or expenditure is derived or incurred. For example, if the amount is derived or incurred half-way through the spreading period, the amount will be spread evenly over the remaining period. If the amount is derived or incurred at or after the end of the spreading period, the amount will be allocated to the income year in which it is incurred or derived. Note that, under the timing provision, an amount of expenditure incurred by an assignor to induce an assignee to receive an assignment of a lease would be allocated to the income year in which the amount is incurred. By assigning the lease, the assignor has no remaining period over which to spread the expenditure. On the other hand, the assignee would spread the amount of income evenly over the remaining period of the lease. If the spreading period is more than 50 years, the amount is allocated evenly over the first 50 years of the spreading period. The timing provision will not apply to an amount that is income under section CC 1 or CG 8, which relates to income from land or capital contributions respectively. Income under section CC 1 would be taxable when derived unless section EI 7 applies. Income under section CG 8 would be spread evenly over 10 years unless the payee chooses to reduce the cost base of the depreciable property under section DB 64. An exception applies to this new timing rule if the person ceases to hold the relevant land right, or the estate in land from which the land right is granted. There will generally be a “wash-up” calculation of income and deductions if a person ceases to hold the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted, part-way through the spreading period (subsections (4) and (5)). 30 For income, if there is a remaining amount to be allocated under the main spreading provision in section EI 4B(3), the amount of income will be allocated to an income year (the balance year) ending before the end of the spreading period, if –  at the beginning of the balance year, the person holds the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted; and  in the balance year, the person ceases to hold the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted (subsection (4)). Example On 1 April 2013, a landlord pays a tenant $100,000 as an inducement to enter into a 10-year lease. On 6 June 2016, the tenant transfers the lease to a new tenant. Both the landlord and the tenant have a balance date of 31 March. The $100,000 payment is taxable to the tenant under section CC 1B and deductible to the landlord under section DB 20B. The timing of income for the tenant under section EI 4B(4) is illustrated in the table below: Income year Tenant Deduction Income 2013–14 – $10,000 2014–15 – $10,000 2015–16 – $10,000 2016–17 – $70,000 2017–18 – – 2018–19 – – 2019–20 – – 2020–21 – – 2021–22 – – 2022–23 – – The landlord continues to allocate the $100,000 deduction under the main spreading provision in section EI 4B(3). For deductions, if there is a remaining amount to be allocated under the main spreading provision in section EI 4B(3), the amount of deductions will be allocated to an income year (the balance year) ending before the end of the spreading period if –  at the beginning of the balance year, either or both the land right and the estate in land from which the land right is granted are held by the person or an associated person; and  at the end of the balance year, neither of the land right and the estate in land from which the land right is granted are held by the person or an associated person (subsection (5)). 31 Note that if the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted is transferred to an associated person, there will be no “wash-up” calculation for deductions. The remaining amount of deductions will continue to be allocated over the spreading period under section EI 4B(3). This is intended as an anti-avoidance measure to prevent the timing of deductions being accelerated by transferring the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted to an associated person. The general anti-avoidance provision in section BG 1 will also apply to counter any tax- driven transactions that attempt to exploit the new timing provision contrary to the policy intent. The definition of “land provision” in section YA 1 is being amended so that the definition of “associated person” applying in section EI 4B is the version applicable to land provisions. Example On 1 April 2013, a landlord pays a tenant $100,000 as an inducement to enter into a 10-year lease. On 6 June 2016, the landlord sells the freehold estate to an unassociated third party for $3,000,000. Both the landlord and the tenant have a balance date of 31 March. The $100,000 payment is taxable to the tenant under section CC 1B and deductible to the landlord under section DB 20B. The timing of deductions for the landlord under section EI 4B(5) is illustrated in the table below: Income year Landlord Deduction Income 2013–14 $10,000 – 2014–15 $10,000 – 2015–16 $10,000 – 2016–17 $70,000 – 2017–18 – – 2018–19 – – 2019–20 – – 2020–21 – – 2021–22 – – 2022–23 – – If the landlord had transferred the land to their spouse, the landlord would continue to allocate $10,000 of deductions to each income year until the 2022–23 income year. The tenant continues to allocate the $100,000 amount of income under the main spreading provision in section EI 4B(3). To prevent overlap, section EA 3, which relates to the timing of prepayments, is being amended to exclude any amounts subject to this timing provision. 32 The tax treatment of lease surrender payments Income New section CC 1C provides that if a person (the payee) derives an amount as a consideration for the agreement by the payee to the surrender of a leasehold estate or the termination of a licence to use land, the amount will be taxable to the payee. The payee must be one of the following:  the person who owns the estate in land from which the leasehold estate or licence is granted; and/or  the person who owns the leasehold estate or licence. In most cases, lease surrender payments will be made by a tenant to a landlord to surrender an existing lease. However, the charging provision will also apply if the payment is made by the landlord to the tenant for them to surrender an existing lease. The existing nominee rules in section YB 21 will apply if a person acts on behalf of the payee. The charging provision will not apply to an amount derived in relation to a freehold estate in land, such as the proceeds from the sale of land. However, the charging provision will apply broadly to include amounts derived in relation to leases, including subleases and other estates or interests in land. The term “leasehold estate” is defined in section YA 1 to include any estate, however created, other than a freehold estate. An exception applies for residential tenants. A lease surrender payment will not be income of the payee to the extent that the payee derives the amount as a tenant of residential premises. If there is a concurrent use of the land right for residential and business purposes, the amount will be apportioned so that only the amount relating to the business use is taxable (subsection (3)). Deductions A matching deduction provision will provide symmetry in the tax treatment of lease surrender payments. New section DB 20C provides that lease inducement payments will be deductible to a person (the payer) if the following conditions are met:  the payer incurs an amount of expenditure as consideration for the agreement by another person (the payee) to the surrender of a leasehold estate or the termination of a licence to use land;  the payer is a person who owns the leasehold estate or licence, or the estate in land from which the leasehold estate or licence is granted; and  the payee is a person who owns the leasehold estate or licence, or the estate in land from which the leasehold estate or licence is granted. Section DB 20C overrides the capital limitation in section DA 2(1). The general permission in section DA 1 must still be satisfied and the other general limitations in section DA 2 will still apply. 33 Timing of income and deductions No specific timing provision is provided for lease surrender payments. The timing of the amount derived or incurred under sections CC 1C and DB 20C will, therefore, be determined under the general provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007. Generally, income and deductions for lease surrender payments will be allocated to the income year in which the amount is derived or incurred. This is considered appropriate for lease surrender payments as there would normally be no remaining period of the land right over which the amount can be spread at the time the lease surrender payments are derived or incurred. 34 35 Other policy matters 36 37 TREATMENT OF SHORT-TERM AGREEMENTS FOR SALE AND PURCHASE UNDER THE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS RULES (Clause 33B) Summary of proposed amendment New section EW 32B adjusts the amount of consideration (payment) that a vendor or purchaser of a short-term agreement for sale and purchase may take into account for the purposes of applying the financial arrangements rules, if they elect to treat the agreement as a financial arrangement. This means the taxpayer will not be able to claim a deduction under the financial arrangements rules for amounts that are payments for capital or goodwill – for example, the cost of acquiring a contract to provide services or any losses on disposal of such a contract. Application date The amendment will apply for a short-term agreement for sale and purchase that a taxpayer elects to treat as a financial arrangement unless the election occurs before 27 September 2012 or the taxpayer has obtained a binding ruling or determination on the tax treatment of the agreement under subpart EW before 27 September 2012. Key features An amendment is being made to adjust the amount of consideration that a vendor or purchaser of a short-term agreement for sale and purchase may take into account for the purposes of applying the financial arrangements rules, if they elect to treat the agreement as a financial arrangement. The amount of consideration that can be taken into account for spreading or undertaking a base price calculation will be limited to debts outstanding under the short-term agreement for sale and purchase. This means taxpayers will not be able to claim a deduction under the financial arrangements rules for either the cost of acquiring the agreement or any losses on disposal of the agreement. Background The purpose behind the financial arrangements rules in the Income Tax Act is to account for the income or expenditure on a financial arrangement (the “interest” component) over the term of the arrangement. 38 The problem under the current financial arrangements rules is that it is possible for taxpayers to receive a deduction for the goodwill component of certain contracts when they are purchased. The rules also allow a deduction for a loss on the sale of onerous contracts. The manner in which this can be achieved is through electing to treat a short-term agreement for sale and purchase (ordinarily, an excepted financial arrangement under section EW 5(22)) as a financial arrangement under section EW 8. The following example illustrates the problem: A company acquires the assets of another company, which includes profitable contracts for the provision of certain future services. The purchase price for the contracts is $5 million, being the present value of estimated future profits from providing services under the contract. Electing that the service contracts be financial arrangements and then applying the financial arrangements rules, a tax deduction of $5 million is available to the purchaser over the life of the contracts, resulting in tax savings of $1.4 million. If the contracts were treated as excepted financial arrangements (as conceptually they should be) the general deductibility rules would treat the amounts as capital (non- deductible) expenditure, just as the sale proceeds to the vendor would usually be capital and therefore non-taxable. The rationale behind allowing a taxpayer to elect to treat a short-term agreement for sale and purchase as a financial arrangement was to reduce compliance costs by allowing any short-term debt under the agreement to be treated for tax purposes as it is for accounting purposes. The rule was never intended to allow taxpayers to convert what would otherwise be capital sums into deductible amounts. Accordingly, it is proposed that an amendment be made to the financial arrangements rules to prevent this outcome. 39 KIWIRAIL (Clauses 12B, 34B, 57(1B), 57(19C)-(19D), 57(23B), 57(25B-25E), 57B, 74(2)-(3) and 94B) Summary of proposed amendments In June 2012 the KiwiRail group announced a restructure of its balance sheet, to reflect a standard commercial valuation approach. Under the new structure, a new state owned enterprise will own and operate the rail and Interislander businesses under the existing KiwiRail brand. Crown land held for rail purposes will be retained by the New Zealand Railways Corporation and made available for use by KiwiRail. Supplementary Order Paper No. 167 contains several technical amendments to support this restructure, to ensure that the restructure does not impose additional tax liabilities, and to provide for the tax position of the new State Owned Enterprise going forward. Application date The amendments will apply from 31 December 2012, being the date of the restructure. 40 41 Remedial matters 42 43 DEDUCTIBILITY OF DEPRECIABLE INTANGIBLE PROPERTY LISTED IN SCHEDULE 14 (Clauses 31B and 105B) Summary of proposed amendment Supplementary Order Paper No. 167 amends section EE 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Income Tax Act 2004 to clarify that depreciable intangible property listed in schedules 14 and 17 of the Acts (respectively) is deductible under the depreciation rules. Application date The amendment to section EE 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will apply from 1 April 2008. The amendment to section EE 7 of the Income Tax Act 2004 will apply from 1 April 2005. Key features The exclusions for land and excepted financial arrangements from the definition of “depreciable property” in section EE 7 are to be amended. The purpose is to clarify that depreciable intangible property listed in schedule 14 of the 2007 Act and schedule 17 of the 2004 Act remains deductible under the depreciation rules. Background There is currently some uncertainty over whether certain depreciable intangible property listed in schedule 14 of the 2007 Act and schedule 17 of the 2004 Act is deductible under the depreciation rules. This is a result of a series of changes to the tax legislation since 1993, which is when certain intangible property such as “the right to use land” became deductible under the depreciation rules. In particular, the uncertainty arises from the exclusion of excepted financial arrangements from the definition of “depreciable property” in section EE 7(e). This exclusion was introduced by the 2004 Act. Leases are excepted financial arrangements under section EW 5(9) of the 2007 Act and the term “lease” is widely defined in the financial arrangements rules to include leases or licences of land, and licences to use intangible property. Consequentially, most depreciable intangible property listed in schedules 14 and 17 of the 2007 and 2004 Acts (respectively) would be excepted financial arrangements and could be excluded from being depreciable property for deduction purposes. 44 Also, the specific exclusion of land from the definition of “depreciable property” in section EE 7(a) of the 2007 Act creates uncertainty over whether the “right to use land” listed in schedule 14 is deductible under the depreciation rules. This is a result of adopting a generic definition of “land”, which includes leases and licences of land, as part of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act 2004. 45 MINOR TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS Supplementary Order Paper No. 167 proposes a number of drafting remedial changes. Many of them are minor changes to cross-references and readers’ aids, but the majority are amendments to remove redundant references to loss-attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs). The LAQC rules have been replaced by look-through company rules.

The amendments contained in this bill, announced as part of Budget 2012, build on the policy changes introduced through Budgets 2010 and 2011 which focused on improving the value of the student loan scheme and encouraging personal responsibility for loan repayments. The bill proposes to broaden the definition of “income” for student loan repayment purposes to broadly align with the definition of income used for determining entitlement to Working for Families tax credits. The definition of “income” for student loan repayment purposes is important in terms of meeting the policy objective of ensuring a borrower’s repayment obligation accurately reflects their ability to repay. Consistent with the Government’s focus on encouraging personal responsibility for loan repayments, the bill also proposes to introduce an information match with the New Zealand Customs Service to locate borrowers who are in serious default when they enter or leave New Zealand. The key impediment to collecting repayments from overseas- based borrowers is a lack of contact details which prevents Inland Revenue engaging with this group. This information match will mean that Inland Revenue can initiate contact with a borrower to discuss their situation and the outstanding arrears. A number of amendments revisit aspects of the design of the student loan scheme to ensure that the administration of the Act is as efficient as possible. Finally, the bill contains a number of technical remedial amendments to ensure the Act works as intended. 4 DEFINITION OF “INCOME” FOR STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PURPOSES (Clauses 63 to 66) Summary of proposed amendments The bill makes changes to the definition of “adjusted net income” for student loan repayment purposes to ensure that a borrower’s repayment obligation accurately reflects their ability to repay their loan. Amendments make further adjustments to “net income” to broaden the definition of income to include other types of income not currently captured. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2014 for the 2014–15 and later tax years. Key features A New Zealand-based borrower’s non-salary and wage income repayment obligation is based on their adjusted net income. Clause 66 introduces new schedule 3 which makes further adjustments to the definition of “adjusted net income” for the purposes of the repayment obligation. The following further adjustments will be made to the definition of net income for student loan repayment purposes to cover:  income from a trust and companies owned by trusts when the borrower is the settlor;  tax-exempt salary and wages, and certain overseas pensions that are exempt from New Zealand tax;  distributions from superannuation schemes that relate to contributions made by a person’s employer within the last two years, when the person has not retired (excluding KiwiSaver and locked-in superannuation schemes);  distributions from a retirement savings scheme when the person has retired early;  income kept in a closely held company;  fringe benefits received by shareholder-employees who control the company;  PIE income that is not “locked in”;  50 percent of non-taxable private pensions and annuities;  main income equalisation scheme deposits; and  payments from trusts, not being beneficiary income, when the borrower is not the settlor. 5 Clause 64 incorporates the Income Tax Act 2007 definition of “net income” in the definition of “adjusted net income” in new section 73. There will no longer be any need for the definition to refer to annual gross income minus annual gross deductions because this is what net income is. Clause 63 therefore repeals the definitions of annual gross income and annual total deductions in section 4. As a consequence of repealing these definitions the requirement to include foreign-sourced income and deductions in the assessment of adjusted net income is now located in clause 3 of new schedule 3 (see clause 66). Clause 64 replaces section 73 with a new section 73 which provides that “adjusted net income” has the same meaning as net income in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 but with the adjustments set out in new schedule 3 of the Act as inserted by clause 66. Background The student loan scheme is an income-contingent scheme, meaning that the amount that a borrower has to repay in any year is dependent on their “net income”. The current definition of “income” for student loan repayment purposes captures income that is taxed to the individual rather than to another entity. It includes income such as salary and wages, income-tested benefits, New Zealand superannuation, interest, dividends and IR3 income such as business profits. For borrowers who derive other types of income, the current definition of income may not reflect their actual earnings or available financial resources which are available to meet their student loan repayment obligation. Therefore, broadening the definition is important in terms of meeting the policy objective of ensuring a borrower’s repayment obligation accurately reflects their ability to repay. It is inequitable and unfair that borrowers have different repayment obligations depending on whether that income is currently included as income for student loans. Changes were signalled by the Government in 2010 relating to the way that “income” should be defined for the purposes of Working for Families tax credits and other social policy programmes. Broadening the definition to better align with that used for Working for Families ensures there is better consistency across all social policy initiatives to improve the integrity of the social assistance system. 6 INFORMATION-MATCHING WITH THE NEW ZEALAND CUSTOMS SERVICE FOR BORROWERS IN SERIOUS DEFAULT (Clauses 34, 43, 44, 45, 46 and 47) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces an information match with the New Zealand Customs Service to locate borrowers in serious default when they enter or leave New Zealand. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Clauses 45 and 46 amend sections 280H and 280I of the Customs and Excise Act 1996 to provide for information-matching between the Customs Service and Inland Revenue to allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue direct access to departure and arrival information. The purpose of the information match is to assist the Commissioner to locate borrowers who are in serious default of their repayments when they enter or leave New Zealand. Clause 44 defines “serious default” to mean the state of having an unpaid amount due and owing, and satisfying criteria established by the Commissioner. 1 Clause 47 amends section 103(1) the Privacy Act 1993 to ensure that the Commissioner is relieved from the requirement to issue a notice of adverse action. New section 103(1C)(a) provides that the Commissioner can take action to recover unpaid amounts owed by a borrower in serious default identified in information supplied to the Commissioner under section 280H of the Customs and Excise Act 1996. Background The key impediment to collecting repayments from overseas-based borrowers is a lack of contact details which prevents Inland Revenue from engaging with this group. This new information match with the New Zealand Customs Service will enable certain borrowers in serious default to be identified by the Customs’ system immediately upon their arrival or departure. Customs will then be able to quickly transfer to Inland Revenue any contact details obtained from the borrower. This information will then be used by Inland Revenue to initiate contact with the borrower to discuss the borrower’s situation and the outstanding arrears. 1 The criteria is likely to include the amount of default, the age of the default and the borrower’s risk profile. 7 The proposed new information match is based on the existing child support alerts match used by Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service. Inland Revenue will send Customs the names, date of birth and IRD number of a selected number of borrowers who are in serious default. Customs will then match this list against the names and birthdates of people crossing the border. 8 9 Efficiency measures 10 11 ALIGNING THE END-OF-YEAR REPAYMENT OBLIGATION THRESHOLDS FOR “PRE-TAXED” AND “OTHER INCOME” (Clauses 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 17, 37, 38, 42 and 49) Summary of proposed amendments The bill proposes amendments to ensure that the $1,500 threshold applies to both “pre- taxed income” 2 and “other income” in addition to salary and wages (if any). This ensures that borrowers will only have an end-of-year repayment obligation if their income from these sources, including salary and wages (if any) is $1,500 or more over the annual repayment threshold (currently $19,084). Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012 for the 2012–13 and later tax years. Key features Clause 13 replaces subparts 2 and 3 with new subpart 2. One set of rules now governs the treatment of all income that is currently dealt with in two separate sets of rules. Currently subpart 2 covers income defined as “pre-taxed income”. Subpart 3 covers income defined as “other income”. New subpart 2 amalgamates these two subparts to ensure that it applies to all New Zealand-based borrowers who derive $1,500 or more of adjusted net income for a tax year and whose income from adjusted net income and salary or wages is $1,500 or more over the annual repayment threshold. Clause 6 amends section 4 to reflect the meaning of terms used in the Act consequential to the amalgamation of existing subparts 2 and 3 of part 2 in new subpart 2 (see paragraph above). The concepts of pre-taxed income and other income are being repealed and replaced with terms appropriate to the concept of “adjusted net income”. (Note that the concept of pre-taxed income will remain in the Act until 1 April 2014 for a limited purpose. See Losses and pre-taxed income). Background Borrowers who earn salary, wages and “pre-taxed income” will receive an end-of-year square-up on their “net pre-taxed income” if they earn over the repayment threshold and receive more than $1,500 of “net pre-tax income”. 2 Pre-taxed income includes interest, dividends, taxable Māori authority distributions, salary or wages from employment as a casual agricultural employee, and salary or wages from employment as an election day worker. 12 In contrast, borrowers who earn business income – that is, self-employed borrowers, borrowers with rental income or borrowers required to declare their worldwide income, are required to include every dollar of non-salary and wage earnings over the repayment threshold. Distinguishing between borrowers based on the type of income they derive is inequitable, and requires two separate systems for Inland Revenue to administer. Therefore, the $1,500 threshold should apply to all borrowers, regardless of the type of income they earn. As a consequence of the proposed changes, the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 can be simplified, as there is no longer the need to distinguish between “other income” and “pre-tax income” based on the $1,500 threshold. 13 RETAINING THE CURRENT PENALTY INTEREST RULES ON UNPAID AMOUNTS When late payment interest is charged (Clauses 5, 36, 40 and 48) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments repeal the rules that were to come into force on 1 April 2013 which provided the ability for late payment interest to be charged from each instalment date. Instead the current rules will be retained so that borrowers are only charged late payment interest if they fail to make full payment by the final instalment date. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Clause 36 will repeal section 221 which, but for its repeal, has the effect of amending the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 in accordance with the provisions set out in schedule 7. Clause 40 repeals schedule 7 consequential on the repeal of section 221. Schedule 7 introduced rules providing the ability for late payment interest to be charged from each instalment date. Background Most borrowers meet their repayment obligations through the deductions taken from their salary and wage income. However overseas-based borrowers and borrowers who have more than $10,000 of income that has not been deducted at source are also required to make instalment payments during the tax year. Currently, late payment interest is only charged if full payment is not made by the final instalment date. From 1 April 2013, these rules were to change and borrowers were to be liable for late payment interest from each instalment date rather than from only the last instalment date. When this policy was developed, it was expected that Inland Revenue would be building these rules within a new loan management system. Changing the way late payment interest is calculated in this system was only going to be worthwhile if the new loan system was in place. Since it is not, the cost of implementing the new late payment interest rules outweigh the benefits. Therefore, late payment interest should continue to be charged from the last instalment date for borrowers who default on either their overseas-based borrower repayment obligations or interim payments. These amendments ensure that borrowers continue to be subject to the current late payment interest rules. 14 Re-instatement of the underestimation penalty (Clauses 50, 51, 58 and 59) Summary of proposed amendments As a consequence of retaining the current rules for charging late payment interest from the last instalment date for borrowers who default, amendments are required to reinstate the underestimation penalty. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2013. Key features Clause 50 adds the underestimation penalty as a defined term and adds the underestimation penalty to the definition of “loan balance” in section 4(1). Clause 51 adds the underestimation penalty to an unpaid amount in section 5. Clause 58 inserts new section 161A so that a borrower will be liable to pay an underestimation penalty if they have underestimated their end-of-year repayment obligation. Clause 59 ensures the amendments currently in clauses 7 and 8 of schedule 7 remain. The effect of these changes is to add the underestimation penalty to the payment priority rules. Background Borrowers who are required to make interim payments have the option of estimating how much they should pay rather than relying on Inland Revenue’s calculation. Under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, a borrower who made an estimate that was later found to be significantly lower than their actual repayment obligation would be liable for an underestimation penalty. The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 repealed the underestimation penalty because charging late payment interest from each instalment date provided sufficient incentives for borrowers to make accurate estimates. As the current late payment interest rules are being retained, then the incentive provided by the ability to charge late payment interest from each instalment date no longer applies. It is therefore appropriate to re-instate the underestimation penalty. 15 The amount of default late payment interest is charged on (Clauses 36, 39(1) and 40) Summary of proposed amendments The effect of the proposed amendments will be to retain the current rules for only charging late payment interest on amounts in default of $334 or more. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Background Under the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, a borrower can have multiple unpaid amounts comprising different kinds of arrears and different periods of assessment. Each unpaid amount is liable for late payment interest if it is $334 or more. From 1 April 2013, the meaning of “unpaid amount” was going to change. Borrowers would be charged late payment interest on all amounts in default if their total default is $500 or more. As the student loan scheme is no longer being administered via a new loan management system, there is no benefit in moving to the new aggregate treatment of unpaid amounts. The current rules will therefore be retained so that borrowers are only charged late payment interest if each repayment obligation in default is $334 or more. How late payment interest is calculated and charged (Clauses 36 and 40) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments repeal the rules that were to come into force on 1 April 2013 which were to change how late payment interest was to be calculated and charged. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Background Under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, borrowers who failed to pay their repayment obligations on time faced a 1.5% monthly penalty. This equated to an annual rate of more than 19.5%. 16 The new Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 reduced the monthly penalty to 0.843%, an equivalent annual rate of 10.8%. The penalty is now referred to as “late payment interest”. Under changes included in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, the way penalties are applied was to change from being applied monthly charged on the day after the due date, to penalty interest calculated daily, charged and compounded monthly. These changes were to come into effect from 1 April 2013. However, there is no longer any benefit in implementing the new rules as they primarily reflected the capabilities of a loan management system that is no longer being used. The current rules of charging late payment interest monthly the day after the due date will continue. Retaining the current rules means that borrowers will still be charged the same penalty rate via a different calculation method. 17 WHEN END-OF-YEAR REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE DUE (Clauses 6, 13 and 58) Summary of proposed amendments The bill includes amendments to ensure that the end-of-year repayment obligation is due on the borrower’s terminal tax due date. Application date Clauses 6 and 13 will apply from 1 April 2012 for the 2012–13 and later tax years. Clause 58 applies from 1 April 2013 for the 2013–14 and later tax years. Key features Clause 6 amends section 4 and defines “terminal payment” to mean the amount that a borrower is obliged to pay in relation to an end-of-year repayment obligation. The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 currently aligns end-of-year payment obligations (known as “remaining repayments”) with the borrower’s interim payment dates from the 2012–13 tax year. The rules are replicated in subparts 2 and 3 respectively. Clause 13 replaces the remaining repayment and due dates under existing subparts 2 and 3 with a single terminal payment and due date. Under new subpart 2, the terminal payment will be due in full on the borrower’s terminal tax date. Clause 58 updates the payment priority rules that take effect from 1 April 2013 to reflect the single terminal payment date. Background Under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, borrowers’ end-of-year repayment obligations were due on their terminal tax due date – either 7 February or 7 April (for borrowers with a tax agent). The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 removed the requirement to pay on the borrower’s terminal tax due date and aligned the payments (known as “remaining repayments”) with the borrower’s interim payment dates. For most borrowers these are 28 August, 15 January and 7 May to align with provisional tax due dates. The spreading of end-of-year repayment obligations over three instalments was intended to reduce compliance and administration costs by removing the terminal tax due date for student loans and to make use of the existing interim payment dates. In hindsight, the potential reduction in compliance and administration costs may not be as great as previously thought. This is because most borrowers will still have to pay income tax on the terminal tax due date, so any compliance savings are reduced. In addition, the new rules are proving complicated to communicate to borrowers. Therefore, the end-of-year repayment obligation will revert back to being due on the borrower’s terminal tax due date. 18 ALIGNING INTERIM PAYMENT DATES FOR SIX-MONTHLY GST FILERS (Clause 13) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment ensures that borrowers who file GST returns six-monthly continue to make interim payments over three instalments. For these filers the interim payment due dates will not be aligned with their provisional tax due dates. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2012 for the 2012–13 and later tax years. Key features New subpart 2, introduced by clause 13, does not carry forward the sunset provision in section 97(4), which has the effect of ending the requirement for borrowers who are registered for GST to pay for their interim payments in three instalments. This means borrowers who file GST returns six-monthly will continue to be able to make their three interim payments separately from their two instalments of provisional tax. Background Borrowers who have a repayment obligation for a tax year that is more than $1,000 are required to make interim payments. Under the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 most borrowers pay their interim payments on the same dates that their provisional tax is due. Borrowers who filed GST returns every six months were an exception; these borrowers paid their provisional tax in two instalments (usually 30 September and 31 March). They were also required to pay their interim payments over three instalments (usually 28 August, 15 January and 7 May). From 1 April 2013, the interim payment due dates for a borrower who files their GST returns every six months were to be aligned with their six-monthly provisional tax due dates. Approximately 650 to 750 borrowers will be both interim payers and six-monthly GST filers. Although there were tangible benefits of aligning these dates for both Inland Revenue and borrowers under the previously proposed loan management system, the cost of building this ability with Inland Revenue’s existing FIRST system for a small number of borrowers outweigh the benefits. 19 OVERSEAS-BASED BORROWERS WITH NEW ZEALAND SALARY AND WAGE INCOME (Clauses 52 and 53) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments will ensure that all salary and wage deductions will be treated as satisfying the borrower’s repayment obligation on a pay-period basis regardless of whether the borrower is New Zealand-based or overseas-based. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2013 for the 2013–14 and later tax years. Key features Clause 52 will repeal section 117 which allowed deductions to be treated as standard payments and offset against overseas-based borrower repayment obligations. Clause 53 amends the definition of “obligations” so that standard deductions for overseas-based borrowers are included as obligations and therefore do not contribute to excess repayments. Background The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 contains tests to determine whether a borrower is overseas-based or New Zealand-based. These tests are important as they determine whether interest should be charged. Borrowers who leave New Zealand and who do not return for 184 days are considered to be overseas-based. An overseas-based borrower only becomes New Zealand-based if they have been physically present in New Zealand for 183 days. Any change to the borrowers status is backdated to when the borrower left or returned to New Zealand. Some borrowers earn New Zealand salary and wages while they are considered to be overseas-based. This typically happens if they return to New Zealand for a short period (less than 183 days) and take up casual work or when they return permanently and start to earn salary and wages during the 183-day qualifying period. Any repayment deductions taken from an overseas-based borrower’s New Zealand salary or wages are treated as regular payments towards the borrower’s loan and can be used to pay off their overseas-based borrower obligation. This treatment differs from the way that salary and wages are treated for New Zealand- based borrowers. Repayment deductions taken from New Zealand-based borrowers are considered to satisfy the New Zealand repayment obligation for that income and, barring significant errors, are not offset against other obligations. 20 The treatment of salary and wages earned by an overseas-based borrower is further complicated when an overseas-based borrower permanently returns to New Zealand and finds paid employment. These deductions are treated as regular payments and offset against the overseas-based borrower obligation, as the borrower is still considered to be overseas-based. However, once the borrower passes the 183-day test and becomes new Zealand-based, their repayment deductions are retrospectively considered to be standard deductions. The rules governing full and final repayment deductions should apply consistently to all salary and wage income earned in New Zealand, regardless of whether that income is earned by a New Zealand-based or overseas-based borrower. The effect of simplifying these rules means that overseas-based borrowers who earn New Zealand salary and wages will have their salary and wage deductions treated as full and final. 21 LATE FILING PENALTIES FOR WORLDWIDE INCOME DECLARATIONS (Clauses 24 and 25) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments will repeal the late filing penalties on declarations of worldwide income. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012 for the 2012–13 and later tax years. Key features Clause 24 will amend section 155 to ensure that the late filing penalty no longer applies for borrowers who do not declare their worldwide income by the required date. Background From the 2012–13 tax year, borrowers who are overseas but who are treated as being New Zealand-based will need to make a declaration of their worldwide income to Inland Revenue so that their repayment obligations can be assessed. The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 introduced late filing penalties for these declarations. The penalty was to act as an incentive for borrowers to comply with their obligation to declare their worldwide income. There are approximately 400 borrowers who will need to file a declaration of their worldwide income. Implementing a new late filing penalty is not justified given the small number of borrowers involved. The Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2012 included an amendment allowing Inland Revenue to revoke the exemption from being treated as overseas-based if the borrower does not meet their filing requirements. This effectively acts as a deterrent as borrowers would then lose their interest-free status. 22 LOSSES AND PRE-TAXED INCOME (Clauses 6 and 13) Summary of proposed amendments The Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2012 introduced amendments to exclude investment and business losses such as rental losses from the calculation of net income for student loan repayment purposes. The income and expenditure from an activity which results in a net loss should be ignored when calculating the net amount earned from both “other income” (business income) and pre-taxed income (for example, interest and dividends). The proposed amendments delay the application of measures that ensure borrowers cannot offset a loss from pre-taxed income when calculating their repayment obligation until the 2014–15 tax year. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012 for the 2012–13 and 2013–14 tax years. Key features Clause 13 will amalgamate subparts 2 and 3 of part 2 into new subpart 2. New subpart 2 will apply to all New Zealand-based borrowers who derive $1,500 or more adjusted net income for a tax year and whose income from adjusted net income and salary or wages is $1,500 or more over the annual repayment threshold. As a consequence there is no longer the need to continue with the concept of “pre-taxed income”. However, new section 73(5) has the effect that for a two-year period until 1 April 2014, the definition of “pre-taxed income” remains and the adjustments specified in subsections (2) to (4) do not apply to borrowers who derive pre-taxed income or a mixture of pre-taxed income and salary and wages. From 1 April 2014 the amendments contained in part 3 will come into force and the definition of “adjusted net income” will be replaced with the new broadened definition of “income” (see clause 64). Background Borrowers who incur losses will no longer be able to offset those losses against another source of income to reduce their income on which the repayment obligation is based. This change was announced as part of Budget 2011 and was enacted in the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2012. End-of-year repayment obligations are calculated by a number of processes. Borrowers with business or rental income file IR3 tax returns. Borrowers who are salary and wage earners with $1,500 or more of income from interest or dividends (pre-taxed income) make pre-taxed income declarations. 23 It is technically possible, although very uncommon, for a borrower who makes a pre-tax income declaration to incur a loss. This could occur, for example, if a borrower borrowed money to buy shares to derive income and the interest expense was larger than the dividend returned for the year, which would result in a loss. Based on 2011 information, approximately six borrowers are in this situation each year. The definition of “income” for student loans is being broadened with effect from the 2014–15 tax year (see Definition of “income” for student loan repayment purposes). To accommodate this change, the IR3 tax return and pre-taxed income declaration require significant modification. Administratively, it is more efficient to delay the application date of the loss exclusion policy for borrowers who incur a loss from pre- taxed income until the 2014–15 tax year. 24 NOTIFYING BORROWERS OF EXCESS REPAYMENTS (Clauses 20 and 21) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments remove the requirement to notify borrowers of excess repayments if they are predominately salary and wage earners or overseas-based from the 2012–13 tax year. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Clause 20 will amend section 120 to ensure that the Commissioner’s obligation to notify a borrower of an excess repayment only applies if the borrower is a New Zealand-based borrower who has income other than, or as well as, salary or wages. Clause 21 will amend section 132 to ensure that if a borrower has made an excess repayment and has not been notified of it, they retain the option of having the repayment refunded. This is achieved by requiring borrowers to make the choice either six months from the date they are notified or six months after the end of the tax year that the excess payment is for, or six months from the day after the due date of the final instalment of an overseas-based repayment obligation for a tax year, whichever is later. Background If a borrower pays more than they are required to pay during the tax year, Inland Revenue is required to notify them in writing that they have made an excess repayment. The borrower can then choose whether they wish to have the excess refunded or leave it on their loan balance (meaning they will pay off their loan sooner). For borrowers who earn salary and wages, their repayment obligation is met through repayment deductions. Overseas-based borrowers have their repayment obligations set at the beginning of the tax year. Any excess repayment for these borrowers will be the result of a conscious decision to pay more towards their loans. There seems to be little benefit in notifying these borrowers that they have made an excess repayment and offering a refund. These borrowers can still request a refund provided they contact Inland Revenue within six months from the end of the tax year. The process where employer errors are detected and borrowers are notified of any significant over-deductions will continue, so that borrowers are protected from inadvertent overpayments. Equally, borrowers making interim payments based on a previous year’s obligation, or borrowers subject to an end-of-year square-up will continue to be notified if they have paid more than is necessary. 25 Consequential matters 26 27 MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS Non-standard due dates for overseas-based borrowers (Clause 16) The bill gives the Commissioner a general discretion to set non-standard due dates for overseas-based borrowers, similar to the discretion provided for due dates for New Zealand-based borrowers. The standard due dates for an overseas-based borrower’s repayment are currently 30 September and 31 March. Currently the legislation allows the Commissioner to set non-standard due dates for the payment of an overseas-based borrower’s repayment obligation only when the borrower’s repayment holiday ends. However, there are other situations when it is appropriate for the Commissioner to be able to set non-standard due dates – for example, when a borrower may have a part-year repayment obligation because they are going overseas or returning from overseas. This amendment will apply from 1 April 2012. Clarifying the challenge procedures for student loans (Clauses 27, 28, 29 and 30) When a borrower disagrees with a decision made by the Commissioner under the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, they can dispute the Commissioner’s decision. If, at the end of the disputes process the Commissioner’s decision stands, the borrower can challenge that decision. However, it is unclear from the Act whether the challenge process is determined by the relevant Court (in the same way as tax offences are) or by the Commissioner. For consistency with the tax system and to ensure the process is transparent, clause 28 inserts new section 174A to ensure that challenges under the Act are determined by the relevant Court. As a consequence, clause 30 repeals section 188 which gave the Commissioner the power to allow or disallow a challenge. Also as part of Budget 2011, changes were made to the student loan scheme to introduce a requirement for borrowers who go overseas to apply for a repayment holiday before they become overseas-based. However, when this change was made, a legislative oversight meant the challenge provisions were not updated to provide borrowers with the ability to challenge the Commissioner’s decision whether to grant a repayment holiday. Clause 29 overcomes this problem by inserting new section 182A to provide the ability to challenge a decision of the Commissioner not to grant the borrower a repayment holiday. The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. 28 Reduction or removal of the student loan shortfall penalty (Clause 26) When a borrower takes an incorrect tax position relating to their income (which affects their student loan repayment liability) and they have a shortfall penalty imposed for income tax, a shortfall penalty can also be imposed for student loans. To ensure symmetry between the tax system and student loans, the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 also removes or reduces the shortfall penalty if the borrower has successfully challenged the imposition of a shortfall penalty for income tax through the relevant Court. Through the disputes process, a borrower can dispute the imposition of a shortfall penalty for income tax and, if successful, have the penalty reduced or cancelled. However, a legislative oversight has resulted in no similar relief being provided for a student loan shortfall penalty when the borrower has successfully disputed the imposition of a shortfall penalty. The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Transitional rule required for instalment arrangements entered between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2013 (Clause 39(2)) Currently, borrowers who are in default and cannot repay their loan can apply to the Commissioner to enter into an instalment arrangement for repayment of the debt. Under the arrangement, the borrower is required to repay their debt in instalments, and if the borrower keeps to the arrangement, any late payment interest imposed during the term of the arrangement is written off. If the borrower fails to keep to the terms of the arrangement, they are subject to the penalties regime that applies at that point. However, with the introduction of the new late payment interest rules from 1 April 2013, two sets of instalment arrangement rules could potentially apply to the instalment arrangement entered into between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2013. This could cause confusion for borrowers. To clarify which rules apply to these instalments, a transitional provision is proposed. The provision reflects the current practice whereby borrowers who keep to the terms of the arrangement will have the late payment interest imposed during the instalment arrangement written off. However, if the borrower fails to keep to the terms of the arrangement, the late payment interest rules that apply during the period the instalment remains in default will apply. The amendment will apply from 1 April 2012. 29 General requirement to keep contact details up to date with Inland Revenue (Clauses 9 and 32) There is a general requirement in the student loan contract for borrowers to keep their contact details up to date with StudyLink and Inland Revenue. There is also a requirement for borrowers to provide contact details when they move overseas. However, there is no specific provision in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 requiring the borrower to keep their contact details up to date with Inland Revenue. To enable Inland Revenue to contact borrowers about their loan, the bill includes an amendment to provide this requirement. The recently enacted Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2012 has placed an obligation on borrowers to keep the details of an alternate contact up to date. It is also appropriate to require that borrowers keep their own details up to date. The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Overseas-based borrower repayment obligation in the year of return (Clauses 7, 18 and 19) The trigger when determining whether a borrower is overseas-based or New Zealand- based is the six-month rule. That is, a borrower is treated as being overseas-based if they are physically absent from New Zealand for a period of 184 consecutive days. A borrower is treated as being New Zealand-based if they are physically in New Zealand for a period of 183 consecutive days. When an overseas-based borrower returns to New Zealand and contacts Inland Revenue to advise they will be returning for at least 183 days (six months) the legislation requires Inland Revenue to treat the borrower as overseas-based even though Inland Revenue has been notified that the borrower will be New Zealand-based. This creates confusion for the borrower and triggers the collection process for overseas-based instalments that may have to be subsequently re-assessed. The proposed amendments will ensure that when a borrower who has returned to New Zealand notifies Inland Revenue that they intend to meet the 183-day qualifying period, the borrower’s overseas-based repayment obligation and New Zealand-based repayment obligations will be assessed before the end of the qualifying period to become New Zealand-based. The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. 30 Overseas-based borrower repayment obligation when repayment holiday ends (Clauses 14 and 15) Inland Revenue calculates an overseas-based repayment obligation for the tax year based on the borrower’s balance at the time the borrower becomes overseas-based, and annually at the start of each subsequent tax year. When the annual calculation is made, borrowers on a repayment holiday for part of the tax year have their overseas-based repayment obligation calculated based on their balances at the start of the tax year. The obligation is then apportioned to the number of days the borrower will not be on a repayment holiday. However, the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 requires that overseas-based borrowers whose repayment holiday ends part-way through a tax year have their overseas-based repayment obligation based on their balance at the time the repayment holiday ends. The proposed amendment ensures that Inland Revenue can include all borrowers who are overseas-based at the start of the tax year in the annual calculation of borrowers’ overseas-based repayment obligations, based on borrowers’ balances at the start of the tax year. This will also ensure that administrative practice is applied consistently to all borrowers. The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Notifying borrower of significant over-deductions (Clause 12) The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 states that the Commissioner must notify a borrower in writing that a significant over-deduction has been made. Before confirming that a significant over-deduction has been made, an Inland Revenue staff member will contact the borrower by telephone to discuss the matter. In the interests of efficiency, an amendment is being made to allow the Commissioner to “notify” the borrower of a significant over-deduction by telephone. The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. 31 The amount of late payment interest (Clauses 55 and 56) Consequential amendments are being made to link the payment interest rate to the loan interest rate so that it responds to market changes. Clause 55 replaces .843% with “late payment interest rate” and defines “late payment interest rate”. Clause 56 reduces the late payment interest rate for borrowers who are under agreed repayment arrangements. The amendments apply from 1 April 2013 for the 2013–14 and later tax years. Pre-emptive instalment arrangements (Clause 23) Borrowers can enter into instalment arrangements if they have an unpaid obligation. At present there is no provision to enter into a pre-emptive instalment arrangement if the borrower knows they will be unable to pay an obligation in full and on time. An amendment is being made to allow borrowers to enter into pre-emptive instalment arrangements before an amount becomes unpaid. The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Right to cancel loan contract (Clause 8) Borrowers may cancel their loan contract within seven working days of the date they received their loan entitlement letter. The borrower must then return any loan advances and pay any interest accrued. The loan advance paid back to StudyLink as part of the cancellation process is effective from the date of the original drawdown. This means the loan is effectively cancelled for Inland Revenue’s purposes on the date of the original transaction and any interest charged is reversed. There is therefore no need for the provision stating that the borrower must pay any interest accrued. The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. 32 Minor technical amendments Clause 49 ensures that the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 continues to be included in the schedule of Acts administered by Inland Revenue. The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Clause 22 corrects a drafting error to ensure that the Commissioner has the discretion not to collect a repayment obligation if the amount involved is $20 or more. The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Clause 33 amends section 204 to ensure that the ability to recall all or part of a loan balance applies to contracts signed on, as well as those signed before or after, the date that the section came into force. The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Clause 31 amends section 191(1) to ensure that the repayment obligations on all salary and wage payments are limited to the loan balance as at the last day of the month that the pay-period falls in. The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Clause 35 amends the regulation-making power in section 215 by including reference to new section 16A and section 107A in the list of provisions in paragraph (d) under which regulations may be made specifying requirements for further information to be provided. The amendment will apply from 1 April 2012. Clauses 54, 57, 60 and 61 carry forward amendments previously located in schedule 7 as this schedule has been repealed (see Retaining the current penalty interest rules on unpaid amounts). The amendments apply from 1 April 2013. Clause 48 repeals section 57 of the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2012. This section included changes to schedule 7, which this bill repeals. The amendment applies from the date of enactment.

For the purposes of this Convention, the terms �resident of Canada� and �resident of New Zealand� mean respectively any person who is resident in Canada for the purposes of Canadian tax and any person who is resident in New Zealand for the purposes of New Zealand tax. 2. A resident of a Contracting State also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof. 3. A person is not a resident of a Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention if the person is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State. 4. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraphs�1 and 2 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then their status shall be determined as follows: (a) the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which a permanent home is available to the individual; if a permanent home is available to the individual in both States, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State with which the individual�s personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); (b) if the State in which the individual has their centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if a permanent home is not available to the individual in either State, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which the individual has an habitual abode; (c) if the individual has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which the individual is a national; (d) if the individual is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement. 5.

In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be entitled to claim any relief or exemption from tax provided by the Convention. ARTICLE 5 Permanent Establishment 1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term �permanent establishment� means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. 2. The term �permanent establishment� includes especially: (a) a place of management; (b) a branch; (c) an office; (d) a factory; (e) a workshop; and (f) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place relating to the exploration for or the exploitation of natural resources. 3. A building site, or a construction, installation or assembly project, or supervisory activities in connection with that building site or construction, installation or assembly project, constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts more than 12�months. An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State and to carry on business through that permanent establishment if, for more than 183�days in any 12-month period: (a) it carries on activities which consist of, or which are connected with, the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources, including standing timber, situated in that State; or (b) it operates substantial equipment in that State. 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs�1, 2, and 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State performs services in the other Contracting State: (a) through an individual who is present in that other State for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183�days in any 12-month period, and more than 50�per cent of the gross revenues attributable to active business activities of the enterprise during this period or periods are derived from the services performed in that other State through that individual; or (b) for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183�days in any 12month period, and these services are performed for the same project or for connected projects through one or more individuals who are present and performing such services in that other State, the activities carried on in that other State in performing these services shall be deemed to be carried on through a permanent establishment of the enterprise situated in that other State, unless these services are limited to those mentioned in paragraph�7 which, if performed through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph, services performed by an individual on behalf of one enterprise shall not be considered to be performed by another enterprise through that individual unless that other enterprise supervises, directs or controls the manner in which these services are performed by the individual. 6. For the purposes of determining the duration of activities under paragraphs�3 and 4, the period during which activities are carried on in a Contracting State by an enterprise associated with another enterprise shall be aggregated with the period during which activities are carried on by the enterprise with which it is associated if the first-mentioned activities are connected with the activities carried on in that State by the last-mentioned enterprise, provided that any period during which two or more associated enterprises are carrying on concurrent activities is counted only once. An enterprise shall be deemed to be associated with another enterprise if one is controlled directly or indirectly by the other, or if both are controlled directly or indirectly by a third person or persons. 7. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term �permanent establishment� shall be deemed not to include: (a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; (b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; (c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; (d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information, for the enterprise; (e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character; (f) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in subparagraphs�(a) to (e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character. 8. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs�1 and 2, where a person � other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph�9 applies � is acting on behalf of an enterprise and: (a) has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise; or (b) manufactures or processes in a Contracting State for the enterprise goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph�7 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 9. An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business. 10. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. III. TAXATION OF INCOME ARTICLE 6 Income from Immovable Property 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture, forestry or fishing) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. The term �immovable property� shall have the meaning which it has for the purposes of the relevant tax law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include any natural resources, property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting immovable property apply, usufruct of immovable property, rights to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber, and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the exploitation of, or the right to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber; ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property. 3. The provisions of paragraph�1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property. ARTICLE 7 Business Profits 1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. 2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph�3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. 4. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. 5. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. 6. Where: (a) a resident of Canada beneficially owns (whether as a direct beneficiary of a trust or through one or more interposed trusts) a share of the profits of a business of an enterprise carried on in New�Zealand by the trustee of a trust other than a trust which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and (b) in relation to that enterprise, that trustee has or would have, if it were a resident of Canada, a permanent establishment in New�Zealand, then the business of the enterprise carried on by the trustee through such permanent establishment shall be deemed to be a business carried on in New�Zealand by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in New�Zealand and the resident�s share of profits that is attributable to that permanent establishment may be taxed in New�Zealand. 7. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. 8. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article, an enterprise of a Contracting State that derives income from any form of insurance, other than life insurance, from the other State in the form of premiums paid for the insurance of risks situated in that other State, may to that extent be taxed in the other State in accordance with the law of that other State relating specifically to the taxation of any person who derives such income. However, the amount of the income so derived that may be taxed in that other State in accordance with this paragraph shall not exceed 10�per cent of the gross premiums receivable, except where the income so derived is attributable to a permanent establishment of an enterprise of the first-mentioned State, in which case the other provisions of this Article shall apply. ARTICLE 8 Ship and Aircraft Operations 1. Profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph�1 and Article�7, profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from the carriage by ship or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped in the other Contracting State and are discharged at a place in that other State, may be taxed in that other State. 3. The provisions of paragraphs�1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency. ARTICLE 9 Associated Enterprises 1. Where: (a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State; or the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State��and taxes accordingly���profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. 3. A Contracting State shall not change the income of an enterprise in the circumstances referred to in paragraph�1 after the expiry of the time limits provided in its domestic laws and, in any case, after eight years from the end of the taxable year in which the income which would be subject to such change would, but for the conditions referred to in paragraph 1, have accrued to that enterprise. 4. The provisions of paragraphs�2 and 3 shall not apply in the case of fraud or wilful default. ARTICLE 10 Dividends 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed: (a) 5�per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company that holds directly at least 10�per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends; and (b) 15�per cent of the gross amount of the dividends, in all other cases. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph�2, dividends arising in a Contracting State and paid to the other Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof or to any wholly-owned agency or instrumentality of that State, political subdivision or local authority that performs functions of a governmental nature, shall be taxable only in that other State. However, this provision shall only apply in circumstances as may be agreed from time to time between the competent authorities of the Contracting States. 4. The term �dividends� as used in this Article means income from shares and other income subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. 5. The provisions of paragraphs�1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent establishment situated therein and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article�7 shall apply. 6. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company�s undistributed profits to a tax on the company�s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. 7. Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing Canada from imposing a tax on the earnings attributable to permanent establishments in Canada of a company which is a resident of New Zealand, in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company which is a resident of Canada, provided that the rate of any additional tax so imposed shall not exceed 5�per cent of the amount of such earnings which have not been subjected to such additional tax in previous taxation years. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term �earnings� means profits attributable to such permanent establishments in Canada (including gains from the alienation of property forming part of the business property, referred to in paragraph�2 of Article�13, of such permanent establishments) in accordance with Article�7 in a year and previous years after deducting therefrom: (a) business losses attributable to such permanent establishments (including losses from the alienation of property forming part of the business property of such permanent establishments) in such year and previous years; (b) all taxes chargeable in Canada on such profits, other than the additional tax referred to herein; (c) the profits reinvested in Canada, provided that the amount of such deduction shall be determined in accordance with the existing provisions of the law of Canada regarding the computation of the allowance in respect of investment in property in Canada, and any subsequent modification of those provisions which shall not affect the general principle hereof; and (d) five hundred thousand Canadian dollars�($500,000), less any amount deducted: (i) by the company, or (ii) by a person related thereto from the same or a similar business as that carried on by the company, under this subparagraph�(d); for the purposes of this subparagraph�(d), a company is related to another company if one company directly or indirectly controls the other, or both companies are directly or indirectly controlled by the same person or persons, or if the two companies deal with each other not at arm�s length. 8. The provisions of paragraph�7 shall also apply with respect to earnings derived from the alienation of immovable property in Canada by a company carrying on a trade in immovable property, whether or not it has a permanent establishment in Canada, but only insofar as these earnings may be taxed in Canada under the provisions of paragraph�1 of Article�13. 9. No relief shall be available under this Article if it is the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with an assignment of the dividends, or with the creation or assignment of the shares or other rights in respect of which the dividend is paid, or the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends and the conduct of its operations, to take advantage of this Article. In any case where a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, the competent authority of that State shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State. ARTICLE 11 Interest 1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10�per�cent of the gross amount of the interest. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph�2: (a) interest arising in New Zealand and paid to a resident of Canada shall be taxable only in Canada if it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or a credit extended, guaranteed or insured by Export Development Canada; (b) interest arising in Canada and paid to a resident of New Zealand shall be taxable only in New Zealand if it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or a credit extended, guaranteed or insured by any body in New Zealand of a similar nature to Export Development Canada as may be agreed upon between the competent authorities of the Contracting States. 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph�2, interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may not be taxed in the first-mentioned State if the interest is derived by a financial institution which is unrelated to and dealing wholly independently with the payer. For the purposes of this Article, the term �financial institution� means a bank or other enterprise substantially deriving its profits by raising debt finance in the financial markets or by taking deposits at interest and using those funds in carrying on a business of providing finance. 5. Notwithstanding paragraph�4, interest referred to in that paragraph may be taxed in the State in which it arises at a rate not exceeding 10�per�cent of the gross amount of the interest if: (a) in the case of interest arising in New Zealand, it is paid by a person that has not paid approved issuer levy in respect of the interest. This subparagraph�(a) shall not apply if New Zealand does not have an approved issuer levy, or the payer of the interest is not eligible to elect to pay the approved issuer levy, or if the rate of the approved issuer levy payable in respect of such interest exceeds 2�per�cent of the gross amount of the interest. For the purposes of this Article, �approved issuer levy� includes any identical or substantially similar charge payable by the payer of interest arising in New Zealand enacted after the date of this Convention in place of approved issuer levy; (b) it is paid as part of an arrangement involving back-to-back loans or other arrangement that is economically equivalent and intended to have a similar effect to back-to-back loans; or (c) all or any portion of the interest is paid or payable on an obligation that is contingent or dependent on the use of or production from property or is computed by reference to revenue, profit, cash flow, commodity price or any other similar criterion or by reference to dividends paid or payable to shareholders of any class of shares of the capital stock of a corporation. 6. The term �interest� as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the laws of the State in which the income arises. However, the term �interest� does not include income dealt with in Article�10. 7. The provisions of paragraphs�1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article�7 shall apply. 8. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is deductible in determining the profits attributable to that permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated. 9. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. 10. No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the assignment of the interest, the creation or assignment of the debt-claim or other rights in respect of which the interest is paid, or the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the person which is the beneficial owner of the interest or the conduct of its operations, to take advantage of this Article. In any case where a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, the competent authority of that State shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State. ARTICLE 12 Royalties 1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed: (a) 5�per�cent of the gross amount of the royalties if they are: copyright royalties and other like payments in respect of the production or reproduction of any literary, dramatic, musical or other artistic work (excluding royalties in respect of motion picture films and royalties in respect of works on film, videotape or other means of reproduction for use in connection with television broadcasting), or (ii) royalties for the use of, or the right to use, computer software or any patent or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience (but not including any such royalty provided in connection with a rental or franchise agreement); (b) 10�per�cent of the gross amount of the royalties in all other cases. 3. The term �royalties� as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as consideration for: (a) the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula, or process or other intangible property; (b) the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment; (c) information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience; (d) the use of, or the right to use: motion picture films, films, videotapes or other means of reproduction for use in connection with television, or (iii) tapes for use in connection with radio broadcasting; (e) any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph�(a), any such equipment as is mentioned in subparagraph�(b) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in subparagraph�(c); or (f) total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph. 4. The provisions of paragraphs�1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article�7 shall apply. 5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a person who is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the obligation to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are deductible in determining the profits attributable to that permanent establishment, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. 7. No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with an assignment of the royalties, or with the creation or assignment of the rights in respect of which the royalties are paid or credited, to take advantage of this Article by means of that creation or assignment. In any case where a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, the competent authority of that State shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State. ARTICLE 13 Alienation of Property 1. Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article�6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. Income or gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State, including such gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise), may be taxed in that other State. 3. Income or gains derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic or movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that State. 4. Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of: (a) shares deriving more than 50�per�cent of their value directly or indirectly from immovable property situated in the other Contracting State; or an interest in a partnership, trust or other entity, deriving more than 50�per�cent of its value directly or indirectly from immovable property situated in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. 5. Nothing in this Convention affects the application of the laws of a Contracting State relating to the taxation of gains of a capital nature derived from the alienation of any property other than that to which any of the preceding paragraphs of this Article apply. 6. Where an individual who ceases to be a resident of a Contracting State, and immediately thereafter becomes a resident of the other Contracting State, is treated for the purposes of taxation in the first-mentioned State as having alienated a property (in this paragraph referred to as the �deemed alienation�) and is taxed in that State by reason thereof, the individual may elect to be treated for purposes of taxation in the other State as if the individual had, immediately before becoming a resident of that State, sold and repurchased the property for an amount equal to the lesser of its fair market value at the time of the deemed alienation and the amount the individual elects, at the time of the actual alienation of the property, to be the proceeds of disposition in the first-mentioned State in respect of the deemed alienation. However, this provision shall not apply to property any gain from which, arising immediately before the individual became a resident of that other State, may be taxed in that other State or to immovable property situated in a third State. ARTICLE 14 Income from Employment 1. Subject to the provisions of Articles�15, 17 and 18, salaries, wages and other remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph�1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if: (a) the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183�days in any 12�month period commencing or ending in the taxation year concerned; and (b) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State; and (c) the remuneration is not deductible in determining the profits attributable to a permanent establishment which the employer has in the other State. 3. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a Contracting State in international traffic shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State. ARTICLE 15 Directors� Fees Directors� fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in that person�s capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. ARTICLE 16 Entertainers and Sportspersons 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles�7 and 14, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from that person�s personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. 2. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson in that person�s capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles�7 and 14, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised. 3. The provisions of paragraph�2 shall not apply if it is established that neither the entertainer or the sportsperson nor persons related to them participate directly or indirectly in the profits of the person referred to in that paragraph. 4. The provisions of paragraphs�1 and 2 shall not apply to income derived from activities performed in a Contracting State by a resident of the other Contracting State in the context of a visit in the first-mentioned State of a non-profit organization of the other State, if the visit is wholly or mainly supported by public funds. ARTICLE 17 Pensions 1. Pensions and annuities arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. Pensions arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may also be taxed in the State in which they arise and according to the laws of that State. However, in the case of periodic pension payments, the tax so charged shall not exceed the lesser of: (a) 15�per cent of the gross amount of the payment; and (b) the amount of tax that the recipient of the payment would otherwise be required to pay for the year on the total amount of the periodic pension payments received by the individual in the year, if the individual were resident in the Contracting State in which the payment arises. 3. Annuities arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may also be taxed in the State in which they arise and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 15�per�cent of the portion thereof that is subject to tax in that State. However, this limitation does not apply to lump-sum payments arising on the surrender, cancellation, redemption, sale or other alienation of an annuity. 4. Notwithstanding anything in this Convention: (a) war pensions and allowances (including pensions and allowances paid to war veterans or paid as a consequence of damages or injuries suffered as a consequence of a war) arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State shall be exempt from tax in that other State to the extent that they would be exempt from tax if received by a resident of the first-mentioned State; and (b) alimony and other similar payments arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State who is subject to tax therein in respect thereof shall be taxable only in that other State, but the amount taxable in that other State shall not exceed the amount that would be taxable in the first-mentioned State if the recipient were a resident thereof. 5. For the purposes of this Article, the term �pension� includes any payment made under a sickness, accident or disability plan, as well as any payment made under the social security legislation in a Contracting State. 6. For the purposes of this Article, the term �annuity� means a stated sum paid periodically at stated times during life or during a specified number of years, under an obligation to make the payments in return for adequate and full consideration in money or money�s worth (other than services rendered), but does not include a payment that is not a periodic payment or any annuity the cost of which was deductible in whole or in part for the purposes of taxation in the Contracting State in which it was acquired. ARTICLE 18 Government Service 1. (a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration, other than a pension, paid by a Contracting State or a political subdivision thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision shall be taxable only in that State. (b) However, such salaries, wages and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the individual is a resident of that State who: is a national of that State, or (ii) did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services. 2. The provisions of Articles�14, 15 or 16 shall apply to payments in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by a Contracting State or a political subdivision thereof. ARTICLE 19 Students Payments which a student or business apprentice who is, or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State, a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first-mentioned State solely for the purpose of that individual�s education or training receives for the purpose of that individual�s maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that State. ARTICLE 20 Other Income 1. Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention shall be taxable only in that State. 2. The provisions of paragraph�1 shall not apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph�2 of Article�6, if the recipient of such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case, the provisions of Article�7 shall apply. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs�1 and 2, items of income of a resident of a Contracting State not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention and arising in the other Contracting State may also be taxed in that other State. Where such income is income from a trust resident in Canada, other than a trust to which contributions were deductible, the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the income if the beneficial owner is a resident of New Zealand, provided that the income is taxable in New Zealand. IV. ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION ARTICLE 21 Elimination of Double Taxation 1. In the case of Canada, double taxation shall be avoided as follows: (a) subject to the existing provisions of the law of Canada regarding the deduction from tax payable in Canada of tax paid in a territory outside Canada and to any subsequent modification of those provisions��which shall not affect the general principle hereof��and unless a greater deduction or relief is provided under the laws of Canada, tax payable in New Zealand on profits, income or gains arising in New�Zealand shall be deducted from any Canadian tax payable in respect of such profits, income or gains; (b) where, in accordance with any provision of the Convention, income derived by a resident of Canada is exempt from tax in Canada, Canada may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on other income take into account the exempted income. 2. Subject to the provisions of the laws of New Zealand which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand tax of tax paid in a country outside New�Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), Canadian tax paid under the laws of Canada and consistent with this Convention, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand from sources in Canada (excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income. 3. For the purposes of this Article, profits, income or gains of a resident of a Contracting State which may be taxed in the other Contracting State in accordance with this Convention shall be deemed to arise from sources in that other State. V. SPECIAL PROVISIONS ARTICLE 22 Non-Discrimination 1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith that is more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. 2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a third State has in that other State carrying on the same activities in similar circumstances. 3. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents. 4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises which are residents of the first-mentioned State in similar circumstances, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of a third State, are or may be subjected. 5. In this Article, the term �taxation� means taxes which are the subject of this Convention. ARTICLE 23 Mutual Agreement Procedure 1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, address to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which that person is a resident an application in writing stating the grounds for claiming the revision of such taxation. To be admissible, the application must be submitted within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. 2. The competent authority referred to in paragraph�1 shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States. 3. A Contracting State shall not, after the expiry of the time limits provided in its domestic laws and, in any case, after eight years from the end of the taxable period to which the income concerned was attributed, change the income of a resident of either of the Contracting States by including therein items of income which have also been included in income in the other Contracting State. This paragraph shall not apply in the case of fraud or wilful default. 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention and may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of applying the Convention. ARTICLE 24 Exchange of Information 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles�1 and 2. 2. Any information received under paragraph�1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to taxes, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. 3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs�1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: (a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; (b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; (c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). 4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph�3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. 5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph�3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because the information relates to ownership interests in a person. 6. Authorized representatives of a Contracting State shall be permitted to enter the other Contracting State to interview individuals or examine a person�s books and records, with their consent, in accordance with procedures mutually agreed upon by the competent authorities. ARTICLE 25 Assistance in the Collection of Taxes 1. The Contracting States undertake to lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims. This assistance is not restricted by Articles�1 and 2. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this Article, including agreement to ensure comparable levels of assistance. 2. The term �revenue claim� as used in this Article means an amount owed in respect of taxes of every kind and description collected, by or on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Convention or any other instrument to which the Contracting States are parties, as well as interest, administrative penalties and costs of collection related to such amount. This Article only applies to revenue claims that are in respect of a tax year that commences after a date that is five years before the date on which this Convention enters into force. 3. When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, that revenue claim may, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of collection by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. Where an application for collection of a revenue claim is accepted, that revenue claim shall be collected by that other State in accordance with the provisions of its laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State. 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph�3, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for purposes of paragraph�3 shall not, in that State, be accorded any priority applicable to a revenue claim under the laws of that State by reason of its nature as such. In addition, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for the purposes of paragraph 3 shall not, in that State, have any priority applicable to that revenue claim under the laws of the other Contracting State. A revenue claim of a Contracting State shall not be enforced by imprisonment of the debtor in the other Contracting State. 5. Proceedings with respect to the existence, validity or the amount of a revenue claim of a Contracting State shall not be brought before the courts or administrative bodies of the other Contracting State. 6. Where, at any time after a request has been made by a Contracting State under paragraph 3 and before the other Contracting State has collected and remitted the relevant revenue claim to the first-mentioned State, the relevant revenue claim ceases to be a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State that is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, the competent authority of the first-mentioned State shall promptly notify the competent authority of the other State of that fact and, at the option of the other State, the first-mentioned State shall either suspend or withdraw its request. 7. Unless the competent authorities otherwise agree, ordinary costs incurred in providing collection assistance in respect of a revenue claim of a Contracting State shall be borne by the other Contracting State and any agreed extraordinary costs incurred shall be borne by the first-mentioned State. 8. In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: (a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; (b) to carry out measures which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public); (c) to provide assistance if the other Contracting State has not pursued all reasonable measures of collection available under its laws or administrative practice; (d) to provide assistance in those cases where the administrative burden for that State is clearly disproportionate to the benefit to be derived by the other Contracting State. ARTICLE 26 Members of Diplomatic Missions and Consular Posts 1. Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article�4, an individual who is a member of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of a Contracting State which is situated in the other Contracting State or in a third State shall be deemed for the purposes of the Convention to be a resident only of the sending State if that individual is liable in the sending State to the same obligations in relation to tax on total income as are residents of that sending State. 3. The Convention shall not apply to international organizations, to organs or officials thereof and to persons who are members of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of a third State or group of States, being present in a Contracting State and who are not liable in either Contracting State to the same obligations in relation to tax on their total income as are residents thereof. ARTICLE 27 Miscellaneous Rules 1. The provisions of this Convention shall not be construed to restrict in any manner any exemption, allowance, credit or other deduction accorded by the laws of a Contracting State in the determination of the tax imposed by that State. 2. Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing a Contracting State from imposing a tax on amounts included in the income of a resident of that State with respect to a partnership, trust, company, or other entity in which that resident has an interest. 3. For the purposes of paragraph�3 of Article�XXII (Consultation) of the General Agreement on Trade in Services of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, done at Marrakesh on 15�April�1994, the Contracting States agree that, notwithstanding that paragraph, any dispute between them as to whether a measure falls within the scope of this Convention may be brought before the Council for Trade in Services, as provided by that paragraph, only with the consent of both Contracting States. Any doubt as to the interpretation of this paragraph shall be resolved under paragraph�4 of Article�23 or, failing agreement under that procedure, pursuant to any other procedure agreed to by both Contracting States. VI. FINAL PROVISIONS ARTICLE 28 Entry Into Force 1. Each of the Contracting States shall notify the other Contracting State, through diplomatic channels, of the completion of the necessary domestic procedures for this Convention to enter into force in New Zealand and in Canada. This Convention shall enter into force on the date of the later of these notifications and its provisions shall have effect: (a) in New Zealand: in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non-resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the second month following the date on which this Convention enters into force, (ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1�April following the date on which this Convention enters into force.

The Convention between the Government of Canada and the Government of New�Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income, done at Wellington on 13�May�1980 (referred to herein as the �1980�Convention�) shall cease to have effect from the dates on which this Convention becomes effective in accordance with paragraph�1. 3. The 1980�Convention shall terminate on the last date on which it has effect in accordance with paragraph�2. ARTICLE 29 Termination 1. This Convention shall continue in effect indefinitely but either Contracting State may, on or before June�30 of any calendar year after the year of the entry into force, give to the other Contracting State a notice of termination in writing through the diplomatic channels. In such event, the Convention shall cease to have effect: (a) in New Zealand: in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non-resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the second month following that in which the notice of termination is given, (ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1�April in the calendar year following that in which the notice of termination is given. (b) in Canada: in respect of tax withheld at the source on amounts paid or credited to non-residents, on or after the first day of the second month following that in which the notice of termination is given, and (ii) in respect of other Canadian tax, for taxation years beginning after the end of that calendar year. 2. This Convention shall terminate on the last date on which it has effect in accordance with paragraph�1, unless the Contracting States agree otherwise.
