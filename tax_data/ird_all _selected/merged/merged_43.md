JOINT SUBMISSION THE DISPUTES RESOLUTION PROCEDURES IN PART IVA OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT 1994 AND THE CHALLENGE PROCEDURES IN PART VIIIA OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT 1994 BY THE TAXATION COMMITTEE OF THE NEW ZEALAND LAW SOCIETY AND THE NATIONAL TAX COMMITTEE OF THE NEW ZEALAND INSTITUTE OF CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS 1780478: JZD 1 This paper is a joint submission from the Taxation Committee of the New Zealand Law Society (“Society”) and the National Tax Committee of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (“NZICA”). Both the Society and NZICA have for some time been concerned about the effectiveness of the disputes resolution procedures and challenge procedures in Part IVA and Part VIIIA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”). These procedures have been in place now just over ten years, and it is time for a review. The Society and NZICA have sought the views of practitioners, and taking those views into account, this paper sets out those thoughts, and makes some recommendations for change. This paper is divided into two parts. We first consider the disputes resolution procedures in Part IVA of the TAA. We then separately consider the challenge procedures in Part VIIIA of the TAA. In each we consider briefly the background to the procedures, then we outline the issues that have arisen in practice which we believe need to be resolved. Finally we provide some recommendations and options for change. 1780478: JZD 2 PART IVA OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT 1994: THE DISPUTES RESOLUTION PROCEDURES 1. BACKGROUND 1.1 The disputes resolution procedures were enacted in late 1996 following a review of Inland Revenue by the Organisational Review Committee, chaired by Sir Ivor Richardson (“Richardson Committee”) in 1994. The Richardson Committee was established to review Inland Revenue and its activities, which included reviewing the practices leading to tax assessments and the way in which disputes were being managed under the former objection procedures. 1.2 In its report (Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department, April 1994), the Richardson Committee stated that there were significant deficiencies with the objection procedures then in place, including: (a) Inland Revenue had a number of chances to reconsider its assessment decision, which caused uncertainty for the taxpayer and reduced the incentive for Inland Revenue to get its assessment correct; (b) A higher level of technical expertise was required earlier in the process; (c) Inland Revenue determined both the assessment initially, and the objection (in the words of the report Inland Revenue was both “player” and “referee”); (d) The cost of disputing a tax case was far too high; (e) Resolution of tax disputes was slow because: (i) Information withheld by either party resulted in delay; (ii) There were perverse incentives to withhold information; (iii) Disputes that should have been settled by discussion and full disclosure of the facts were instead being dealt with by the Courts. 1.3 To address these problems, the Richardson Committee introduced the current disputes resolution procedures and the challenge procedures. The disputes resolution procedures sought to address the above problems by: (a) Requiring the parties to take steps within strictly prescribed time limits if it was proposed to amend an original assessment; (b) Focusing on early resolution of disputes; (c) Imposing an evidence exclusion rule that required the parties to “put all their cards on the table” early in the process or they would be barred from raising facts, evidence or legal arguments in any subsequent litigation; (d) Proposing that a separate and independent review would be held before an amendment assessment would be issued. In this way the audit investigation and final quantification of liability would be separated, by way of a final adjudication. 1780478: JZD 3 1.4 The purposes of the regime as outlined in the Richardson Committee’s report were positive and laudable. The rules when designed had those purposes in view and this is enshrined in section 89A of the TAA. A subsequent review of the disputes resolution procedures took place in 2003 and a Discussion Document was issued in July 2003 Resolving Tax Disputes: A Legislative Review. However that review was restricted to issues of timeliness and cost, and the changes made to the procedures at that time have not in the Society’s and NZICA’s view resolved the problems with the disputes resolution procedures. 1.5 Broadly, the steps in the current disputes resolution procedures are: (a) The taxpayer self-assesses its tax liability; (b) Alternatively, during an audit, prior to issuing a Notice of Proposed Adjustment, the Inland Revenue might raise issues by letter, requesting that the taxpayer agree to a schedule of adjustments between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue; (c) The taxpayer or the Inland Revenue (initiating party) issues a Notice of Proposed Adjustment, which proposes an adjustment to the self-assessment and sets out why the self-assessment is incorrect - this must be issued by the taxpayer generally within four months from the date of the assessment, and by the Inland Revenue within the four year statute bar period (or within any agreed extension to that period); (d) The other party then responds with a Notice of Response, either accepting or rejecting the Notice of Proposed Adjustment - this must be issued by the other party within two months of the Notice of Proposed Adjustment, or that party is deemed to have accepted the initiating party’s Notice of Proposed Adjustment; (e) The Notice of Response is then accepted or rejected by the initiating party - with, in the case of the taxpayer, this acceptance or rejection being required within two months of the Notice of Response, but there being no time frame in the case of the Inland Revenue. For taxpayer initiated disputes, the taxpayer has no control over the time at which Inland Revenue permits the dispute to progress past the Notice of Response stage. If the taxpayer fails to meet that time frame it is deemed to have accepted the Inland Revenue’s position; (f) If the Notice of Response is rejected, the parties may attend a conference to try to resolve the dispute. The conference is not legislated and is not a compulsory part of the procedures; (g) If the dispute is unresolved, the Inland Revenue issues a Disclosure Notice - there is no time frame specified in which this must occur and taxpayers do not have the right to issue a Disclosure Notice. The issuing of a Disclosure Notice is a necessary step for the procedures to proceed further whether the Inland Revenue is the initiating party (ie the party which issued the Notice of Proposed Adjustment) or not; (h) Within two months of a Disclosure Notice the taxpayer is required to issue a Statement of Position, and it is here that the evidence exclusion rule in section 138G of the TAA becomes relevant. The taxpayer is limited to the facts and evidence, and issues arising from them, and the propositions of law, disclosed in its Statement of Position. If the taxpayer fails to meet that two month time frame, it is deemed to have accepted the Inland Revenue’s position; 1780478:JZD 4 (i) The Inland Revenue should respond to the taxpayer’s Statement of Position within two months by providing its own Statement of Position (in which event the evidence exclusion rule in section 138G of the TAA also applies to the Inland Revenue). However, in terms of section 89N(2)(b) all that is required by the statute is that the Inland Revenue considers the taxpayer’s Statement of Position, before issuing an amended assessment. It is not required to respond with a Statement of Position. Given that the statute does not require a Statement of Position from Inland Revenue, it is perhaps not that surprising that if Inland Revenue fails to meet the two month time frame there is no sanction - it is not deemed to have accepted the taxpayer’s position; (j) If Statements of Position are exchanged, as a matter of internal practice the dispute may be referred to the Adjudication Unit of the Inland Revenue (which is a part of the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel) for it to review the papers and determine whether an amended assessment will be issued. It is not a requirement of the statute that this referral occur, and there is no time frame by which this should occur (apart from the statutory time bar which is always a requirement on Inland Revenue in terms of issuing amended assessments). Inland Revenue’s Standard Practice Statements 08/01 and 08/02 provide that the Inland Revenue’s practice is to refer disputes to Adjudication “where practicable” and usually within one month of the date of issue of the Inland Revenue’s Statement of Position; (k) The Adjudication Unit then issues a report providing the reasons for its decision and amends the assessment (if needed). It should be noted that as a matter of internal Inland Revenue practice if the Adjudication Unit’s report is in favour of the taxpayer, the decision is binding on the Inland Revenue, but if the Adjudication Unit’s report is in favour of the Inland Revenue, the taxpayer may issue challenge proceedings and proceed to Court. 1.6 The contents of the Notice of Proposed Adjustment, Notice of Response and Statement of Position are prescribed in sections 89F, 89G and 89M of the TAA, respectively. Broadly, the Notice of Proposed Adjustment, Notice of Response and Statement of Position are required to identify the proposed adjustment(s), state the facts and law relied upon, describe the grounds for the proposed adjustment or the rejection of the proposed adjustment, state how the law applies to the facts and either provide or outline evidence relied upon. 2. THE DISPUTES RESOLUTION PROCEDURES HAVE NOT CURED THE PROBLEMS 2.1 The Society and NZICA believe that the procedures as enacted following the Richardson Committee’s report and the subsequent amendments made in 2004 have not cured the problems identified by the Richardson Committee. All the problems identified by the Richardson Committee still exist with the current system, in a different form. For instance: (a) Inland Revenue can still change the basis upon which it assesses a taxpayer. Under the disputes resolution procedures, the Inland Revenue need only consider a Statement of Position issued by a taxpayer before issuing an assessment (section 89N(2) of the TAA). As a consequence of the evidence exclusion rule and the decision in C of IR v Zentrum Holdings Limited (2006) 22 NZTC 19,912, if Inland Revenue does not itself issue a Statement of Position (and it need not do so as there is no sanction on it for failing to do so), 1780478: JZD 5 it is not bound to any particular facts, evidence, legal issues or basis of assessment. (b) The separation envisaged by the Richardson Committee between the audit investigation and the final quantification of an amended assessment has not occurred. The disputes resolution process operates between the taxpayer and the investigator entirely throughout and it is only at the absolute end of the process that there is any potential independent review by the Adjudication Unit within the Inland Revenue. At all points in the process when the taxpayer’s arguments are considered it is the investigator that considers those arguments. In addition, as has been seen in recent occasions, that independent review by the Adjudication Unit is considered a discretionary decision of the Commissioner, and may not take place in any event. (c) Similarly, the Inland Revenue is still both “referee” and “player” - the person issuing a Notice of Proposed Adjustment and/or determining whether a taxpayer Notice of Proposed Adjustment or Notice of Response is rejected, is the same person who undertook the audit. That same person manages the disputes resolution process throughout the exchange of documents. The current processes do nothing to address this issue. (d) The costs involved in pursuing a tax dispute through the disputes resolution procedures first, and then the challenge procedures have increased since the introduction of the procedures. The impact of the evidence exclusion rule, and the nature of the documents that are exchanged in the disputes resolution processes has led to increased cost for taxpayers, rather than reduced costs. The increased costs apply to taxpayers across the board - small claims and also those in larger cases. In addition, when disputes reach the Courts, there is duplication between the requirements under the TAA and those of the court processes. This leads to even greater cost. Taxpayers are choosing not to pursue disputes as a consequence. The Richardson Committee noted (under the old system) that many taxpayers, once aware of both the costs and delays of objections to tax assessments, decided to drop the dispute. That situation has been exacerbated by the disputes resolution procedures which increase the costs on taxpayers (in preparing the formal documents that are part of the procedures), in any form of dispute with the Inland Revenue. Our experience is that in effect Inland Revenue may issue questionable matters below the $25,000 with impunity, as Inland Revenue knows that it will cost the taxpayer more than that proceed through the disputes resolution procedures and to challenge the Inland Revenue’s position in Court. Effectively taxpayers are “burned off” by the high costs imposed by the disputes resolution procedures. The Richardson Committee noted (in respect of the old system) that: The resulting perception, of paying too much tax by default, may lead disgruntled taxpayers who undoubtedly tell other people and who may not be willing compliers in the future. The effect of the increased costs under the new system is reflected in the statistics - in the year ended 30 June 1996 there were 64 cases taken to the Taxation Review Authority. By 2006 this had dwindled to 13. In the eleven years from 1996 to 2006, the Inland Revenue advises there were six cases heard by the Taxation Review Authority in its small claims jurisdiction. NZICA and the Society do not believe these taxpayers are having their disputes 1780478:JZD 6 resolved under the disputes resolution procedures, rather the costs are too high. Further details of our views in this area are in Appendix A. Effectively, taxpayers with disputes over small amounts, have no forum for their disputes to be considered because of the cost in taking those disputes through the disputes resolution procedures in the first place. It is important to realise that 89% of New Zealand businesses employ five or fewer people. The disputes resolution procedures do not cater for the majority of New Zealand businesses or individuals. The use of money interest regime is also a significant factor in this regard. (e) Resolution of disputes is still slow. This is not because parties withhold information, rather the opposite. The evidence exclusion rule has had the effect that parties add arguments, facts and evidence, rather than narrowing the issues to the core matters in dispute. Both parties have to respond to each other’s arguments, even if the arguments do not seem to have substance. For example, if the Inland Revenue alleges that a taxpayer is subject to the general anti-avoidance provision, the taxpayer is committed to a large dissertation on case law; because if the taxpayer does not raise those arguments at that stage, the taxpayer is not able to defend that allegation when the matter goes to court. In addition, resolution is slow because the time frames imposed by the disputes resolution procedures generally only apply to taxpayers, and the Inland Revenue is generally not subject to times frames, apart from the four year statutory time bar. This means the disputes resolution process is just as slow as the former procedures which the Richardson Committee considered were not operating effectively. (f) Cases which should be resolved still reach the Courts. This is because there is no actual resolution process built into the disputes resolution procedures. The part of the disputes resolution procedures where the Inland Revenue and taxpayers meet to discuss the issues (the conference) is not part of the formal statutory procedures, and often does not take place at all. In addition, no guidance has been provided to Inland Revenue officials as to their settlement powers, and as a consequence both pre-assessment and post-assessment it is extremely difficult to reach sensible commercial settlements with Inland Revenue. 2.2 The Society and NZICA have joined together as the professional bodies most affected by this legislation. We are seeking some fundamental changes to the legislation which we believe are necessary to make the disputes resolution procedures achieve their objectives and operate in a workable way. 3. SPECIFIC ISSUES WITH THE DISPUTES RESOLUTION PROCEDURES IN PRACTICE AND SUGGESTIONS FOR CHANGE 3.1 While the current disputes procedures try to rectify some of the deficiencies of the former objection procedures, the experience of NZICA and Society practitioners after ten years of the operation of these procedures is that they have significant deficiencies of their own. In particular the Society and NZICA believe that in a number of respects the current disputes resolution procedures are not operating as was intended and are not meeting the purposes enshrined in section 89A of the TAA. We outline our concerns further below. 1780478: JZD 7 Improving the accuracy of disputable decisions made by the Inland Revenue 3.2 Section 89A(1)(a) of the TAA provides that one of the purposes of the disputes resolution procedures is to improve the accuracy of disputable decisions made by the Inland Revenue. The experience of practitioners is that the disputes resolution procedures have the positive intention of requiring Inland Revenue to record its propositions of law, its view of the facts and the evidence it is relying upon. However by formally recording those matters practitioners believe Inland Revenue often takes entrenched positions. This leads to the purpose of the procedures to resolve disputes (as outlined in section 89A(1)(d) of the TAA) not being met. 3.3 In addition, when Notices of Proposed Adjustment or Notices of Response are issued by Inland Revenue, they can be extremely lengthy, raise numerous issues which are not substantive, and can at times be incoherent. Taxpayers do not always seek the advice of experienced tax practitioners and simply cannot always afford to do so. Documents issued by Inland Revenue should promote understanding of the tax matters at issue. Unfortunately Notices of Proposed Adjustment and Notices of Response issued by Inland Revenue can lead to misunderstanding, the entrenchment of positions, or, due to incoherency, can simply cause taxpayers not to dispute a position taken by the Inland Revenue even where Inland Revenue’s position is inaccurate. While we recognise that the standard of Notices issued by taxpayers may at times also be problematic, the Society and NZICA believe that Inland Revenue’s role as tax administrator requires it to produce higher quality documents to promote early resolution and enhance understanding of the tax system. Inland Revenue has resources, experienced staff, and in a process as important as this to tax administration we believe the Inland Revenue should be expected to produce Notices of Proposed Adjustment or Notices of Response of a clear, coherent nature. This would, we believe, resolve many of the issues which practitioners from both the Society and NZICA have faced when working with these procedures. 3.4 Practitioners have also found that issues raised by Inland Revenue in Notices of Proposed Adjustment or Notices of Response issued by Inland Revenue are often abandoned if the matter proceeds further through the disputes resolution procedures. Practitioners from the Society and NZICA have commented that this most often arises because those issues had no substance in the first place, and were raised by Inland Revenue officials without experience and without oversight from more experienced officials. There is also anecdotal evidence of Inland Revenue officers not being prepared to omit or exclude issues because of the risk that at a later stage a different part of Inland Revenue will take an alternative view. This is frustrating for taxpayers and their advisers. We are also concerned that taxpayers feel intimidated by issues raised which actually have no substance or upon which Inland Revenue will not ultimately rely. 3.5 The Richardson Committee highlighted in its report the need for the disputes resolution process to “encourage the Commissioner to apply the appropriate resources to getting the assessment right in the first place1’, “\[to ensure\] adequate legal analysis is applied to the points at issue to ensure that the law has been correctly interpreted’, and that “steps should be taken to ensure that, .. appropriate legal and other expertise is applied, and generally there is adequate internal review” (paragraph 10.3, Appendix E paragraphs 6, 7 and 9). The Society and NZICA believe that this is a requirement for the disputes resolution procedures to be operating well, and that if the early documents in the disputes resolution procedures do have that appropriate expertise applied, this could lead to more effective resolution of disputes and administration by Inland Revenue. We believe some changes are necessary to meet what was intended by the Richardson Committee. 1780478:JZD 8 Independent review 3.6 The Society and NZICA believe that a Standard Practice Statement requiring particular levels of independent Inland Revenue internal review of the early documents in the disputes resolution procedures (ie the Notice of Proposed Adjustment or Notice of Response) prior to their issue to taxpayers would materially assist the process. By this we mean an independent review from an Inland Revenue officer outside the office from which the document is issued. The Richardson Committee also focused on independent review at an early stage being a vital part of the procedures (Appendix E, paragraph 7). 3.7 The experience of the Society and NZICA is that a review by the office’s own internal legal team does not always provide the necessary separation and objectivity needed for these early significant documents in the disputes resolution procedures. An alternative office may well lead to it being easier for a less entrenched view to be taken. In some cases, depending upon the nature of the issues involved, or the amount of the tax in dispute, an independent review of the type we refer may well require a review by National Office personnel of a Notice of Proposed Adjustment or Notice of Response which is to be issued by an office outside Wellington. The Society and NZICA understand that an independent internal review of this type does happen most regularly at Statement of Position stage using the Litigation Management Unit, but our experience is that it is actually at the earlier stages of the procedures that such a review would assist to narrow the issues to the substantive ones, to make the documents clear and coherent, and potentially this could lead to a more effective resolution at an earlier stage. Word limits 3.8 Another aspect that such a Standard Practice Statement should contain is a word limit for Inland Revenue issued documents. We believe this would also materially assist the ease of application of the procedures and would also potentially assist the understanding of taxpayers. The experience of practitioners is that these documents are often extremely long, for no discernable purpose and often include lengthy quotes of a general nature in a particular issue. This is especially problematic in a document intended, at least in part, for non-specialist consumption. Reducing the likelihood of disputes arising by encouraging open and full communication 3.9 Section 89A(1)(b) of the TAA provides that a purpose of the procedures is to reduce the likelihood of disputes arising by encouraging full and open communication between the Inland Revenue and taxpayers. The Society and NZICA have stated above the concerns about the nature of the Notices of Proposed Adjustment and Notices of Response which are an early part of the process, and we have made suggestions for change. We believe those suggestions would also assist to meet the purpose of encouraging full communication of the basis of Inland Revenue’s decisions. The conference and the use of money interest regime 3.10 We note that one of the purposes outlined in section 89A(1)(b) is to encourage open and full communication by taxpayers to the Inland Revenue so that all information necessary is received by the Inland Revenue. This in turn has the purpose of ensuring that the Inland Revenue makes accurate decisions. The Society and NZICA note that the Inland Revenue has extensive information gathering powers in other 1780478:JZD 9 parts of the TAA which can be utilised to obtain information from taxpayers. We accept that incentives to provide that information to the Inland Revenue should be an inherent part of the disputes resolution procedures. However, the Society and NZICA believe that the disputes resolution procedures are not in their current form encouraging taxpayers to narrow the matters at issue, and they are not encouraging either party to operate in the spirit of full disclosure. 3.11 The conference (where taxpayers and the Inland Revenue meet to discuss the dispute) is an important aspect of the procedures which is not currently compulsory, and the Society and NZICA believe that if it was compulsory it would encourage better communication between Inland Revenue and taxpayers. The experience of NZICA and Society practitioners is that the conference more often than not is not held, or not given significance by Inland Revenue officials, despite Inland Revenue’s Standard Practice Statements 08/01 and 08/02 emphasising that the conference is considered an important part of the process from an administrative perspective. 3.12 We note that there is a suggestion in Standard Practice Statements 08/01 and 08/02 that the conference will be tape recorded.1 The Society and NZICA believe that the conference should be focused on resolution; not Inland Revenue evidence gathering. The conference is based on materials already available, so there should be no new primary evidence being presented, consequently there should be no need to tape record the conference. We think that this shows that the Inland Revenue is approaching the conference as an opportunity to gather evidence, as opposed to dispute resolution which was the goal of the Richardson Committee. 3.13 Given that promoting the prompt and efficient resolution of a dispute is another purpose of the procedures (section 89A(1)(d) of the TAA), a conference which is a required legislative part of the procedures would in our view be providing the necessary emphasis that the procedures are focused upon resolution. We note that the Richardson Committee also considered the conference to have “the intention of identifying and resolving issues, particularly factual ones” (Appendix E, paragraph 10). We believe this should be a legislated part of the process for that purpose. We believe that details such as the location of the conference, cost, and the manner in which a conference is held (eg by teleconference or on a face to face basis) can be dealt with by way of Inland Revenue Standard Practice Statement and will depend upon the particular circumstances of the case. 3.14 Our suggestions follow: (a) Part IVA should be amended to provide that at least one conference is a statutorily required part of the disputes resolution procedures in Part IVA, with an independent mediator, or personnel from the Litigation Management unit or the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel, being available to attend. We believe the presence of an independent party would provide taxpayers with the confidence that a resolution is possible. It may not always be necessary for such a person, but the Society and NZICA believe the potential involvement of an independent mediator would be a useful incentive for some taxpayers to engage in the process. (b) A compulsory meeting should be held within two months of the receipt of the Notice of Response. A time frame is needed and should be set out by statute. Currently, in our experience, the lack of time frames on the Inland Revenue side leads to significant time delay. 1 Paragraphs 175-176 1780478: JZD 10 (c) If the conference procedure is working and the parties agree by notice to have further meetings, there should be the ability for the parties to agree to suspend the operation of the statutory time bar indefinitely until the conference is completed, or until one party by notice withdraws its agreement to further meetings. We note that the Richardson Committee also suggested such a waiver of the time bar (Appendix E paragraph 10) and we believe flexibility as to the extent of such a waiver should be considered (as the current rule in section 108B of the TAA provides only for limited time bar extensions and is not flexible enough). (d) The use of money interest regime is a significant factor in tax disputes. The Society and NZICA believe that while a use of money interest regime is inevitable in terms of the design of an efficient tax disputes system, that the current regime (which involves taxpayers paying 14.24% for underpaid tax, with the Inland Revenue paying 6.66% for overpaid tax) involves too wide a differential. If there is a substantive dispute as to whether tax is due in the first place, and the taxpayer is unable to fund a voluntary payment of tax to stop the interest accruing, the use of money interest regime gives rise to very serious financial risk for taxpayers (which must be reported in their accounts). In addition, the disputes resolution procedures are controlled to a significant degree in terms of timing by the Inland Revenue (as discussed below). This is the case whether the Inland Revenue has initiated the disputes resolution procedures or whether the taxpayer has. The Inland Revenue can be less than efficient (even tardy), and taxpayers can do nothing about that. It is taxpayers who are penalised for Inland Revenue’s inefficiency by way of an imposition of use of money interest on underpaid tax at a very high rate. The Society and NZICA believe that the use of money interest regime is a factor in taxpayers deciding not to pursue disputable matters. We believe the rate differential between the Inland Revenue’s paying rate and the taxpayer’s paying rate is far too wide and needs to be reviewed. The use of money interest regime has become a penalty on taxpayers and requires reconsideration. In terms of considering use of money interest in the context of a reform of the disputes resolution procedures some options should be considered in relation to use of money interest: (i) As an incentive for taxpayers to continue to liaise with the Inland Revenue in an attempt resolve the dispute, use of interest money interest could be suspended while the conference process continues; (ii) Alternatively, use of money interest could be imposed at a lesser rate (for instance the Commissioner’s paying rate, or a different rate approximating for instance bank deposit rates) during the disputes resolution process as a whole. We note also that the actual rate on underpaid tax faced by taxpayers is more like 11% thanks to the activity of Tax Management NZ. Accordingly, it seems inappropriate for the statute to impose at a higher rate; (iii) Alternatively, to ensure that use of money interest is not being imposed where there is time delay which is not the fault of the taxpayer, use of money interest could be suspended if the Inland Revenue fails to meet particular timeframes for response built into the disputes resolution procedures. 1780478: JZD 11 (e) If the parties do not agree by notice to have further meetings, the matter is not resolved, and the disputes resolution procedures are proceeding, the statute should provide that the Inland Revenue must issue a Disclosure Notice within two months following the end of the conference. If the conference fails, we believe the procedures should commence again without delay. Currently, in our experience, the lack of time frame for Inland Revenue to issue a Disclosure Notice leads to significant delay, and, even where the taxpayer initiated the disputes resolution procedures the taxpayer is unable to take any further steps to progress the dispute. This is for instance especially problematic with the accrual of use of money interest against the taxpayer at relatively high rates as discussed above. An alternative option to setting a specific time frame for Inland Revenue to issue a Disclosure Notice, is to allow the taxpayer to issue a Disclosure Notice generally, or in particular circumstances - for instance where the taxpayer has initiated the disputes resolution procedures. The evidence exclusion rule 3.15 Another aspect to the issue of communication is the evidence exclusion rule. The evidence exclusion rule in section 138G of the TAA applies following the issue of a Disclosure Notice, and limits both taxpayers and the Inland Revenue to the facts and evidence, and issues arising from them, and the propositions of law disclosed in their respective Statements of Position. This rule was intended by the Richardson Committee to “provide an appropriate incentive for disclosure of the factual basis of the arguments of both the taxpayer and Commissioner (Appendix E paragraph 10). The evidence exclusion rule was therefore intended to promote the purpose of encouraging open and full communication. 3.16 There are a number of problems which have arisen in practice in relation to this rule. Rather than incentivising full communication, it is leading to a “kitchen sink” approach to facts, issues and evidence in the Statement of Position with every possible issue, piece of evidence, and thought included in the Statement of Position. This is because it is only in very narrow circumstances that a Court will allow any further facts, evidence or issues to be raised (section 138G(2)). This generates a perverse incentive not to narrow the issues to the critical ones, but in fact to outline all possible matters, no matter how relevant or substantive. 3.17 In addition, because of the evidence exclusion rule focusing on facts and evidence, and the Court discretion to allow further matters to be raised focusing on what the applicant could have discovered with due diligence (section 138G(2)(a)), the evidence exclusion rule is leading to a huge amount of work being done prior to the issue of a Statement of Position. This is leading to the disputes resolution process being very costly indeed, and the Society and NZICA believe that the effect of the evidence exclusion rule is simply pricing some taxpayers out of pursuing the disputes resolution procedures. In addition, even though the rule is leading to high cost in the preparation of a Statement of Position, there is also a potential double up of costs if the matter reaches proceedings, as discovery processes must also be completed. This is an even greater disincentive to proceed with a dispute. We are also aware that at least one Taxation Review Authority Judge is of the view that the evidence exclusion rule may be contrary to the Taxation Review Authority’s function as a commission of inquiry (as outlined in section 15 of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994). 3.18 We believe the evidence exclusion rule which was intended to promote communication is instead becoming unwieldy and is leading to a lack of clarity in communication. We note that in its 2003 Discussion Document Resolving Disputes: A Legislative Review the Government noted that the number of audited cases being 1780478: JZD 12 disputed was decreasing. We believe this is because the evidence exclusion rule (amongst other factors) is causing disputes to be too expensive. Our experience is that unfortunately it is not necessarily due to the Inland Revenue’s decisions being any more accurate. In our experience, the disputes resolution procedures have detrimental costs effects for business. In our experience, some businesses give up legitimate disputes because the process will consume too much time and cost. The approach of Inland Revenue of leaving numerous issues alive until the last moment also unduly increases the costs. The overall effect is a reduced willingness of businesses to engage in the tax disputes process. 3.19 We finally note that it is also not a requirement that the Inland Revenue issue a Statement of Position; it can issue an amended assessment after simply considering the taxpayer’s Statement of Position (section 89N(2) of the TAA). This means that the application of the evidence exclusion rule can be one sided - only applying to taxpayers. This seems unintended, and certainly the Richardson Committee’s focus was on both parties - taxpayers and the Inland Revenue. Practitioners in the Society and NZICA have experience of the rule being one-sided in application. 3.20 If the conference was a statutory part of a process which is clearly designed to achieve a resolution (as we suggest), both the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue are incentivised to put their best case on the table at the conference and there is no need for the evidence exclusion rule. Instead taxpayers and the Inland Revenue would focus on ensuring that the early documents in the procedures clearly outlined their respective positions prior to the conference. 3.21 We suggest the evidence rule is amended, and that it focuses on limiting a taxpayer and the Inland Revenue to the propositions of law raised in the respective Statements of Position in a subsequent challenge before the Court (subject to Court discretion otherwise and subject also to the comments in paragraph 3.37 and following below). The Society and NZICA recognise that for the challenge procedures to operate fairly, they must operate from the premise that the parties are limited to positions previously taken. This was also the position in the former objection procedures, and has been the position because of long standing case law. However, our view is that the scope of the evidence exclusion rule is too wide, and it is not meeting its intended purpose in any event. If the evidence exclusion rule remains in its current form, in the alternative consideration needs to be given to ensuring that discovery obligations are amended to ensure that double cost does not arise if the matter reaches Court proceedings. Early identification of the basis for a dispute 3.22 Section 89A(1)(c) of the TAA provides that the disputes resolution procedures are intended to promote the early identification of the basis for a dispute. The Society and NZICA have made suggestions above as to internal Inland Revenue policy changes to ensure that Notices of Proposed Adjustment and Notices of Response issued by Inland Revenue are more accurate and coherent. We have also made suggestions above as to statutory changes to ensure that the conference is a required part of the process, to incentivise the parties to communicate with one another and to promote resolution. The Society and NZICA believe that the exchange of documents that is the hallmark of the disputes resolution process, while cumbersome, does lead to a better identification of the basis for the dispute, and this would be improved as the quality of the documents produced improves. 1780478:JZD 13 Promoting the prompt and efficient resolution of disputes 3.23 Section 89A(1)(d) of the TAA provides that the prompt and efficient resolution of disputes is a purpose of the disputes resolution procedures. The Richardson Committee focused on this aspect, stating that the procedures should “encourage both the taxpayer and the Commissioner to avoid undue delay in resolving disputes that do occur (Appendix E, paragraph 7). In the 1994 Discussion Document Resolving Tax Disputes: proposed procedures the Government stated that a “primary objective of the new procedures was “to deal with any disputes over tax liability fairly, efficiently, and expeditiousif (paragraph 3.2). The experience of the Society and NZICA is that this objective is not being met by the procedures. Time frames and sanctions on Inland Revenue 3.24 There are a number of reasons why this objective is not being met. The first is that the time frames in the procedures are one-sided, applying only to taxpayers, and not to the Inland Revenue. This can mean very substantial time delays before any dispute progresses. 3.25 As an example, following the issue of a Notice of Response by a taxpayer to an Inland Revenue initiated Notice of Proposed Adjustment, there is no time frame in which a conference should be held, and there is no time frame for a Disclosure Notice to be issued by the Inland Revenue. Taxpayers do not have the ability to issue a Disclosure Notice and thereby ensure continuation of the dispute procedures. Taxpayers can do nothing to restart the process when it is stalled. In one case a Society practitioner waited over eight months for a Disclosure Notice to be issued. In the intervening period, the Inland Revenue officials did not continue to investigate the matter in dispute. There was no explanation for the delay. Use of money interest continued to be imposed during this period where the taxpayer was unable to do anything to restart the process. Practitioners have also said that in the case of taxpayer initiated disputes, Inland Revenue delays are commonplace (sometimes years), and that this is a very serious problem indeed (particularly because of the use of money interest regime). 3.26 The second reason the objective is not met is that there are effective sanctions on taxpayers for failing to meet time frames but only one effective sanction on Inland Revenue. If Inland Revenue fails to file a Notice of Response within two months of a taxpayer initiated Notice of Proposed Adjustment, it is deemed to accept the taxpayer’s position (section 89H(2)). A taxpayer on the other hand is deemed to accept the Inland Revenue’s position if it fails to issue a Notice of Proposed Adjustment within (generally) four months of the issue of an assessment or other disputable decision, or if it fails to respond to an Inland Revenue Notice of Proposed Adjustment or Inland Revenue Notice of Response (section 89H(1) and section 89H(3)), or to a Disclosure Notice by issuing a Statement of Position (section 89M(7)). If any of those events occur, the taxpayer is generally unable to file challenge proceedings (section 89I). In addition, Inland Revenue is entitled to apply to the Court for an order that the time for completion of the disputes resolution procedures is extended, or for the procedures not to be completed at all (section 89N(3)) and this can occur at any time during the four year statutory time bar period (section 89N(4)). The only time sanction on the Inland Revenue is the four year statutory time bar. Taxpayers have the right only to apply to the Court for further time to file a Statement of Position (section 89M(11)) only within the two month response period, and, in that event the “conduct of the parties in the dispute” is considered by the Court (section 89M(12)), while interestingly, no such consideration is required when the Inland Revenue applies to the Court under its mirroring ability in section 89M(10). 1780478: JZD 14 3.27 The lack of time sanctions on the Inland Revenue within the procedures means that Inland Revenue controls the time frame in which the disputes resolution procedures progress. In the case of taxpayer initiated disputes this is leading to significant time delays and a significant amount of use of money interest being accrued by taxpayers with genuine disputes. Inland Revenue’s control of the process is leading to a slow resolution of matters. We suggest that time frames should be brought into the procedures for Inland Revenue as well to promote prompt and efficient dealing by Inland Revenue with the procedures. 3.28 As stated above, we believe a compulsory conference should be held within two months from the date of the Notice of Response. We also believe that a Disclosure Notice should be issued within two months following the end of the conference, or, in the alternative that the taxpayer be given the right to issue a Disclosure Notice in particular circumstances (for example if it is a taxpayer initiated dispute, or if the Inland Revenue fails to do so within a particular time frame). These time frames should be incorporated in Part IVA. We believe that to ensure that disputes are dealt with efficiently, fairly and expeditiously, incentives on the Inland Revenue to complete the procedures should be built into the procedures. We also suggest that if Inland Revenue fails to meet time frames, and in the absence of a Court order otherwise (which can only arise in “exceptional circumstances”), Inland Revenue should be deemed to have accepted the taxpayer’s position. Alternatively, use of money interest should be suspended if Inland Revenue fails to meet particular time frames. The definition of ‘‘exceptional circumstance” 3.29 The third reason that the objective is not being met is that the “exceptional circumstance” definition applying to taxpayers is narrower than that applying to Inland Revenue. This definition applies to provide the ability for late notices to be deemed to be received on time. Taxpayers must rely upon the Inland Revenue exercising discretion to accept a late notice, and this is only exercised if there is an “exceptional circumstance”, namely an event outside the control of the taxpayer which provides a reasonable justification for not acting within the specific time frame (with additional even narrower rules applying in the case of failure by an agent of the taxpayer). The other way in which a taxpayer may have the discretion exercised in its favour is if the delay was ‘minimal’ (section 89K(3)). The Inland Revenue on the other hand can apply to the Court, and while an “exceptional circumstance” is something beyond the control of the Inland Revenue, included amongst its purview is a change in law, or a decision of a Court (section 89L(3)). The Inland Revenue also has the additional power in the absence of an exceptional circumstance to apply to the Court for a time extension or an order that the procedures do not need completion (section 89N(3)). 3.30 The Society and NZICA believe that the definition of “exceptional circumstance” applicable to both Inland Revenue and taxpayers should provide the Inland Revenue and the Court a clear discretion to allow a late filing of a document in circumstances where there is evidence of a clear intention to dispute, an error has been made, and where the time delay is not significant in the overall circumstances. We believe that taxpayer should also be entitled to seek the intervention of the Court (other than by way of expensive judicial review proceedings) if the Inland Revenue’s discretion is not exercised in its favour. The taxpayer should have a similar ability to the Inland Revenue to apply to the Court for a general time extension (as is the case for Inland Revenue in section 89N(3)) - this could extend the statute bar by the period of extension as well. 3.31 The current definition of “exceptional circumstance” in section 89K(3) of the TAA is too narrow in our view, and the Inland Revenue is not exercising its discretion in section 1780478: JZD 15 89K(1) as a consequence. This is leading to matters that are genuinely disputed being deemed accepted and being unable to be challenged because of very minor errors by taxpayers. This is not meeting the purpose of prompt and efficient resolution, as it applies more narrowly to taxpayers than the Inland Revenue, and is not promoting the fair and accurate resolution of disputes as a consequence. The processes in the Adjudication Unit 3.32 Finally, for the resolution of disputes to be “efficient’ the Society and NZICA believe that administrative time frames are needed around the referral of a dispute to the Adjudication Unit. The Adjudication Unit is not a legislated part of the process, and it is fair to say that there are different views on the need for that amongst practitioners. Where practitioners all agree however, is that if it is to happen, referral to Adjudication should happen within a set time frame from the exchange of Statements of Position. We believe that should be within one month. We comment that while this is the Standard Practice Statements’ suggestion of a time frame for referral to Adjudication (SPS 08/01, SPS 08/02), this standard is rarely met in our experience. We also note that those Standard Practice Statements downplay the significance of the Adjudication Unit providing that referral to that Unit is not essential and can be omitted. 3.33 The Society and NZICA also note that matters which are referred to Adjudication are taking an inordinate amount of time to go through the Adjudication process. The process for the Adjudication Unit needs to be reconsidered. One of the objectives of the disputes resolution procedures was to lead to more timely resolution than was the case with the objection procedures. That objective is not met by the Adjudication Unit which can in our experience take well over a year to respond with a report even on rather straight forward issues. We note that the Standard Practice Statements (SPS 08/01 and SPS 08/02) suggest that the Adjudication Unit will generally produce a report in a four month time frame. Practitioners do not have experience of that time frame, and instead our experience is a significantly longer period, sometimes years. Practitioners believe that the Adjudication Unit’s current processes are unwieldy, and both the Society and NZICA believe that work needs to be put into making this part of the procedures much more cost and time efficient than it is at present. 3.34 At present the Adjudication Unit is unable to determine factual matters, and this can lead to Adjudication Unit refusing to issue a report, resulting in further delay in the disputes resolution process. The information provided to the Adjudication Unit is comprehensive, as the Adjudication Unit has access to each party’s Statement of Position. It makes little sense for the Adjudication Unit to be unable to review those documents and make factual determinations. The Society and NZICA suggest giving the Adjudication Unit the ability to determine factual issues would lead to a more efficient process. 3.35 We also note that Inland Revenue is able to and does utilise Adjudication reports as precedent for future matters for internal staff, while taxpayers have no such access to those reports. Publication of basic summaries of Adjudication reports, or publication of Adjudication reports in redacted form where taxpayers cannot be identified should be released. There are currently used internally by Inland Revenue as legal guidance, and the release of these, in redacted form, would provide guidance as to Inland Revenue’s views. This would promote voluntary compliance. Other efficiencies 3.36 We also believe that other quite straight forward efficiencies could be considered in the regime. For instance, the design of the various parts of the Notice of Proposed 1780478:JZD 16 Adjustment, Notice of Response and Statement of Position could be reviewed so as to ensure that, if the matter proceeded to Court, preparing a Statement of Claim or Notice of Claim would simply be a task of cutting and pasting work already done. This would provide some cost efficiency if the matter proceeded to Court. Other issues arising when the disputes resolution procedures do not operate appropriately 3.37 There are circumstances where the exchange of documents as prescribed by the disputes resolution procedures is not going to lead to prompt and efficient resolution of the dispute, or identification of issues, and simply serves no substantive purpose. In those situations forcing the Inland Revenue and taxpayers to proceed through the procedures simply is added cost - from a taxpayer perspective this is additional compliance cost for no benefit. Test cases 3.38 An example of when the disputes resolution procedures are inappropriate is where there is a case before the Courts which deals with substantially similar issues to the disputed matter. Under the current procedures in this circumstance a taxpayer must seek the agreement of the Inland Revenue to suspend the disputes procedures (section 890 of the TAA) and this can only occur where the Inland Revenue has first exercised its sole discretion to designate the case before the Court a “test case” under section 138Q of the TAA. The Inland Revenue on the other hand is able to seek the exercise of the Court’s discretion to suspend the disputes resolution procedures under section 89N(3), as a general matter, and in this context even where the taxpayer does not agree to a suspension of the disputes resolution procedures under section 890. 3.39 The Society and NZICA suggest that this ability to suspend the disputes procedures be available to taxpayers by way of Court order, and not just in circumstances where the Inland Revenue has designated a case before the Courts as a “test case”, but rather where a significant similarity exists between a case before the Courts and the taxpayer’s dispute. Taxpayers should not be forced to judicially review the Inland Revenue’s decision in this area to get a test case designation considered. They should have the right to apply for a Court order. We also suggest that where such an order is granted, that the statute bar in section 108 of the TAA be suspended, being reactivated again when the decision in the relevant case is issued. We suggest below in paragraphs 5.3 to 5.15 that a test case panel and Government funding of test cases should be considered. The test case panel could equally operate to assist in this context. Ability to seek leave or to elect out of the disputes resolution procedures in particular circumstances 3.40 Another example where the procedures are inappropriate is where it is quite clear that the matter will not be resolved and that both parties will proceed to Court. For instance, this would arise in relation to a point upon which the Inland Revenue has assessed other taxpayers and is litigating, or in the case where a year subsequent to one which is already under dispute is being considered. Currently, unless the taxpayer has completed the disputes resolution procedures it cannot challenge the Inland Revenue’s assessment (section 138B of the TAA). 3.41 Our suggestion for small claims in particular, is the cost of preparing documents for the disputes resolution procedures, would be better spent on a Notice of Claim and on having the Taxation Review Authority in its small claims jurisdiction finally determining 1780478: JZD 17 the matter. We believe that for small claims, taxpayers ought to be able to file a Notice of Claim and proceed directly to the small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority without completing the disputes resolution procedures. In Australia, a model involving a compulsory pre-trial resolution conference between the Australian Tax Office, the taxpayer and a judge has been very successful. Consistently 70% to 80% of disputes are resolved without the need to proceed to a hearing. Approximately 70% of these consent orders were resolved wholly or partly in the taxpayer’s favour.2 We believe a similar approach could be adopted in New Zealand. Under current procedures, the costs of both the disputes procedures and proceeding to the Taxation Review Authority cause taxpayers with small claims not to proceed. We make further comments about small claims and our view that the disputes resolution procedures are failing in this area in Appendix A. 3.42 For other claims, we suggest that at minimum, as a general rule, following the exchange of a Notice of Proposed Adjustment and a Notice of Response, the matter should be able to be elected to go straight to Court by the taxpayer, or that the taxpayer has a mirroring right to the Inland Revenue to apply to the Court for such an order before the disputes resolution procedures commence. For the reasons outlined above at paragraph 3.21, if the taxpayer elects or seeks leave to go straight to the challenge procedures, and, absent the exercise of a discretion by the Court to allow otherwise, the taxpayer should be limited to the propositions of law raised in its Notice of Proposed Adjustment or Notice of Response (whichever is applicable) in the challenge before the Court. 3.43 In the event that a taxpayer was given the right to suspend the disputes resolution procedures and elect to go straight to the challenge procedures or the right to apply to the Court to do so, we would suggest that the Taxation Review Authority have the same or similar powers as the High Court in relation to the ability to take evidence in relation to a suspended dispute so as to create a contemporaneous record. Grounds of assessment 3.44 It is currently possible for there to be no Statement of Position issued by the Inland Revenue before it issues an assessment. This is because the Inland Revenue is only required to consider a Statement of Position issued by the taxpayer before issuing an assessment, and also because the Inland Revenue has the ability to apply to the Court for the disputes resolution procedures not to be completed. In the event there is no Statement of Position from the Inland Revenue, no document establishes what the grounds of assessment are. In C of IR v Zentrum Holdings Limited (2006) 22 NZTC 19,912 the Court of Appeal held that in the absence of a Disclosure Notice no rule applied limiting the Inland Revenue to grounds issued in earlier documents in the disputes resolution process. It had for some time prior to Zentrum been the position that the Inland Revenue was limited to its grounds of assessment in subsequent Court proceedings (as a consequence of C of iR\\i VH Farnsworth Ltd\[1984\] 1 NZLR 428). The Court took the view in Zentrum that in the absence of section 138G of the TAA (the evidence exclusion rule) applying, nothing confined the taxpayer or the Inland Revenue to their pre-assessment positions. 3.45 In the case of a dispute where the Inland Revenue has issued an assessment, has considered a taxpayer’s Statement of Position, but has not issued one of its own, this means that a taxpayer is confined to grounds in its pre assessment documentation, but the Inland Revenue is not. Presumably in this situation a taxpayer is forced to rely 2 Review of the Tax Office Management of Part IVC Litigation Inspector General of Taxation (7 August 2006). 1780478: JZD 18 upon the discretion of the Court to allow it to adduce further evidence and legal arguments if the Inland Revenue raises a different ground of assessment. 3.46 This position was unintended and in the Society and NZICA’s view it is inappropriate. In its 1994 Discussion Document Resolving Tax Disputes: Proposed Procedures the Government stated (paragraph 5.7 to paragraph 5.8): \[B\]oth parties must know which points are at issue before they can accurately identify the relevant evidence. Introducing a new issue can make different evidence relevant. .. This intended outcome is broadly analogous with the position under the current procedures, in which taxpayers are limited to their grounds of objection, and, similarly, the Commissioner may not change the basis of an assessment to which an objection has been made. The judicial phase of the current procedure is technically an appeal from the Commissioner’s decision. Under the new procedure, that substance will remain. 3.47 The Society and NZICA believe that a greater focus should be placed upon the early stages of the disputes resolution procedures. We have already suggested that there is a need for a compulsory conference. We have also suggested that there is a need for greater overview within Inland Revenue of the Notice of Proposed Adjustment or Notice of Response issued by Inland Revenue. The Society and NZICA suggest that the legislation should prescribe where the grounds of assessment are. Our suggestion is that when issuing an assessment the Inland Revenue should be required to specify its grounds of assessment to the taxpayer in its Notice of Assessment, with the Inland Revenue being limited to those specific grounds in any subsequent matter before the Courts. It may be that the Inland Revenue simply refers in the normal course to its Statement of Position as containing those grounds, but, where there is no such document, and in the absence of it being otherwise specified in the Notice of Assessment itself, there should be a statutory presumption that those grounds are contained in the Notice of Proposed Adjustment or Notice of Response issued by the Inland Revenue (whichever is applicable). This would also incentivise Inland Revenue to ensure that those documents clearly communicate to taxpayers the basis for its view. Settlement of disputes pre-assessment 3.48 Another area of concern is in relation to the Inland Revenue’s ability to settle cases pre-assessment. Practitioners have consistently commented that Inland Revenue seems unable to reach sensible settlements (including for instance by not imposing penalties or use of money interest) in the course of the disputes resolution procedures. Practitioners say that there is inconsistency between Inland Revenue offices and Inland Revenue officers within an office, a lack of clarity about who the ultimate sign-off or decision maker is in a settlement, and a perception that Inland Revenue officers still believe that a settlement is impossible except where it reflects that correct tax outcome. 3.49 As is noted below in relation to settlements of challenge proceedings, it has been clear for some time and case law continues to reiterate that the Inland Revenue is able to reach settlements with taxpayers, including in the course of the tax disputes procedures. Guidance really needs to be given to Inland Revenue staff, and consistently applied. We discuss this issue further below at paragraph 5.16 and following. In the disputes resolution context we would suggest that guidance provide that settlement discussions need to involve an official other than the official who has 1780478:JZD 19 initiated the dispute, or who is dealing with a taxpayer initiated dispute. Practitioners have consistently commented how difficult it is to reach a settlement on a sensible basis during the disputes resolution procedures. An independent review is needed. 1780478: JZD 20 PART VIIIA OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT 1994 PROCEDURES THE CHALLENGE 4. BACKGROUND 4.1 The challenge procedures were enacted alongside the disputes resolution procedures in 1996. The challenge procedures replaced what was the case stated process, under which, following the taxpayer specifying its objection in a Points of Objection Notice, the Commissioner filed proceedings by way of a case stated if an objection to a tax assessment was unresolved. The main difference in the challenge procedures is that under Part VIIIA it is the taxpayer which files a challenge by way of filing a statement of claim or notice of claim. 4.2 There is a very direct link between the challenge procedures and the disputes resolution procedures. Section 138B and section 138C of the TAA set out a number of requirements which must be satisfied before the taxpayer may file a challenge. Included amongst those requirements are the requirement that the assessment or disputable decision being challenged is first disputed and rejected under the disputes resolution procedures, and also that any challenge be filed within two months of the date of issue of the notice of assessment or, in the case of a disputable decision which is other than an assessment, within two months of the date of issue of the Notice of Response by the Commissioner. That two month period is subject to extension by the Court but only in an “exceptional circumstance” (section 138D of the TAA). In addition, further linkages with the disputes resolution procedures arise by way of section 138G of the TAA which imposes the evidence exclusion rule. The evidence exclusion rule provides that that the Commissioner and the taxpayer may raise in the challenge only the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law disclosed in their respective Statements of Position. 4.3 Section 138E of the TAA sets out a number of decisions which cannot be the subject of a challenge, and which must instead be the subject of judicial review proceedings. Included amongst those decisions are discretions on the part of the Commissioner to extend the time for filing a notice or return (for example in the case of the disputes procedures, the Commissioner’s discretion as to whether there is an exceptional circumstance justifying the late filing of a document, can only be subject to judicial review, not challenge). 4.4 For the reasons set out above at paragraph 3.40 and following, our view is that the challenge procedures should be able to be elected into, and the close linkage to the disputes resolution procedures is not always appropriate, and in practice leads to cost issues causing taxpayers not to pursue disputable matters. We have made suggestions relating to that issue above. Our other suggestions relating to the challenge procedures are as outlined below. 5. SPECIFIC ISSUES WITH THE CHALLENGE PROCEDURES IN PRACTICE AND SUGGESTIONS FOR CHANGE Test cases 5.1 The current test case procedure under sections 890, 138Q and 138R of the TAA allows the Commissioner to designate a challenge in the courts as a “test case”. Under section 138Q of the TAA the Commissioner may designate a test case if the Commissioner considers that determination of a challenge is likely to be determinative of all or a substantive number of issues involved in one or more other challenges. If a case is designated a test case then the Commissioner may stay similar cases before 1780478: JZD 21 the courts or the Taxation Review Authority (section 138R) and may, with the agreement of the disputant, suspend the dispute resolution procedures for a “significantly similar” dispute (section 890). 5.2 However, there are a number of problems with the current test case procedure. The current procedure seems to be rarely used and there is little guidance for taxpayers on when the procedure will in fact be used by the Commissioner. As well as being underused, the Commissioner can take far too long to determine whether a case should be treated as a test case. We are aware of one case where it took over 13 months before the Inland Revenue denied the taxpayer’s suggestion for an identified challenge to be designated as a test case. Meanwhile the taxpayer was locked into a time barred dispute process without any way of knowing if the suspension of the disputes resolution procedures under section 890 of the TAA would be granted, with use of money interest continuing to accrue. In addition, the test case designation process is entirely in the hands of the Commissioner - the taxpayer really has little input into the process. Practitioners have also commented that precedential cases are not being heard, because taxpayers cannot afford to both complete the disputes resolution procedures and proceed with a challenge. A test case panel and Government funded test cases 5.3 NZICA and the Society suggest that consideration be given to both a test case panel, and to a government funded test case programme similar to the Australian programme (details of which we have included as Appendix B). In so doing, the test case procedure can function to ensure that precedential cases are before the Courts when they might otherwise as a consequence of costs concerns never reach the litigation stage. The decision of whether to designate a matter a test case would be given more guidance and would involve members of the community including, but not solely limited to, the Commissioner. Such a system would provide for greater certainty for taxpayers as the way that the Commissioner deals with test cases would be comprehensively set out in the legislation. 5.4 Australia has had a test case litigation programme since 1995. The programme provides financial assistance to taxpayers involved in litigation that is regarded as important to the administration of the Australian tax system. The purpose of this programme is to clarify the operation of the laws administered by the Federal Commissioner of Taxation where: (a) There is uncertainty or contention about the operation of areas of law; (b) The issue is of significance to a substantial segment of the public or has significant commercial implications for an industry segment; and (c) It is in the public interest for the issue to be litigated. 5.5 There are three types of funding arrangements that the Australian Tax Office (ATO) enters into under the program: (a) A consent order under which the Federal Commissioner of Taxation pays the other party’s costs; (b) A written order to reimburse the other party’s costs on specific terms; or (c) A formal agreement to provide funding under a Test Case Deed. (The most common type of funding is under a Test Case Deed). 1780478:JZD 22 5.6 The programme is based upon a taxpayer applying for test case funding. Taxpayers are required to submit an application form and a submission detailing the case, the factual background and a full summary of the issues to be tested. The submission must also show how the issue in question relates to an area of tax law that needs clarification and how it affects a significant number of taxpayers. If it is known, the amount of revenue that will be affected by the case should also be included in the submission. Submissions may also be made by a professional or industry body to have a matter of significance tested. Typically, in these cases, an in-principle agreement is sought for the matter being tested and the case indentified for this purpose. Similarly the Federal Commissioner of Taxation may decide to test a matter and seek agreement from a taxpayer to proceed with the case. This may involve seeking the assistance of a professional or industry body to identify a suitable case. There are also cases where the Federal Commissioner of Taxation offers to meet the taxpayer’s costs on an appeal in important cases, without an application for funding being provided. 5.7 If a submission is made by the taxpayer then it is considered by the Test Case Litigation Panel. The Panel consists of members of the accounting and legal professions, as well as senior tax officers from the ATO. The inclusion of representatives from outside of the ATO is to provide independent views and community input. The Panel convenes about four times a year and the submissions received in the previous quarter will be considered by the Panel when it convenes. The Panel then makes recommendations to the Panel’s Chair who has the final say based upon the following criteria: (a) Whether the case is likely to provide a precedent for a large number of taxpayer or a significant industry; (b) Whether the case involves a challenge to a controversial public ruling or a contentious issue raised in either published public rulings or draft public rulings; (c) Whether the case would pre-empt a draft public ruling (this is seen as a positive); (d) The financial capacity of the taxpayer to pursue litigation, but without necessarily excluding applicants able to afford a tax case; (e) Whether the taxpayer is prepared to co-operate to achieve an early hearing; (f) Whether the issue in dispute concerns alleged tax avoidance or benefits allegedly not intended by the government. 5.8 Depending on the strength of the submission, a decision can be made without reference to the Panel. This happens when the submission is approved due to the importance of the issues that are raised or where there is some urgency. A decision can also be made to decline an application without reference to the Panel when a decision needs to be made urgently, such as when the case will go to hearing before the next Panel meeting. 5.9 If an application is successful, then funding is given on the terms set out in the Test Case Deed (unless it is one of the other, less common, types of funding arrangements outlined above). The Deed will provide for reimbursements to the taxpayer for solicitor fees, counsel fees and disbursements. There are limits to the amount of 1780478: JZD 23 reimbursement that a taxpayer receives but the intention is for that taxpayer to be adequately funded to pursue a precedential case. 5.10 Taxpayers are expected under the Test Case Deed to take the stage of their case funded to its conclusion. They are also expected to stick to the agreed issues and where possible an agreed statement of facts. If the case does not proceed on the agreed issues due to the taxpayer’s actions then the funding will be discontinued and funding already paid may have to be reimbursed to the ATO. 5.11 Funding does not automatically roll over if the case is appealed by either side. A fresh application for funding needs to be made for each stage of proceedings. This enables the funding decision makers to take into account the nature of the issue being tested on appeal and the terms of the decision applicants are seeking to appeal. 5.12 The programme receives funding of $2 million annually which has on occasion been in excess of the actual cost of the programme. For the past two years that information is available, the cost of the programme has fallen well short of the $2 million provided for. In 2006-2007 there were 52 applications and 27 cases were funded at a cost of $1.2 million. In 2005-2006 there were 35 applications and 32 cases were funded at a cost of $519,606. 5.13 An example of the benefits of the Australian programme can be seen in some of the cases that have been funded by it. Examples include: (a) FC of T v McNeil \[2007\] ATC 4223 where the High Court of Australia considered the character of sell-back rights in the hands of the taxpayer in relation to her shareholding in St. George Bank Limited. The amount of tax liability in question was less than $600, but the decision also affected the other 80,000 shareholders of St George who were offered sell-back rights. More generally, the decision had an effect on other public companies seeking to issue sell-back rights to their shareholders as a way of capital reduction. (b) FC of T v Stone \[2005\] ATC 4234 which involved a professional sportsperson who received grants, prize money and appearance money from her sport. The High Court of Australia considered whether the money she received as a sportsperson was assessable income. Again, this case involved a relatively small amount of money ($136,448 of assessable income) but involved a question of law that was of wider significance to an industry (being the sports industry). 5.14 A programme comparable to that offered in Australia would ensure precedential decisions could be heard in New Zealand. A programme of this sort would assist to some degree to redress the disparity of resources and technical expertise that exists between the Inland Revenue and taxpayers. In addition, the presence of outside experts in the advisory panel would also bring an independent view to the application process for test cases in the first place, and, in the case of Government funded test cases would help to ensure that important cases are recognised and given funding. As the Australian system has shown, a larger taxpaying public than New Zealand can be served with a government funded test case programme for relatively little cost (less than $2 million a year). 5.15 NZICA and the Society are concerned that costs (including the impact of the use of money interest regime, and of completing the disputes resolution procedures) are such that taxpayers cannot financially pursue meritorious disputes. NZICA and the Society believe that a Government funded test case programme should have a 1780478:JZD24 statutory or regulatory foundation. We believe this would promote confidence in the tax system. While the Inland Revenue may maintain it funds test cases on occasion, any such funding is extremely rare, there is no taxpayer or outside input into that decision, and given resourcing of Inland Revenue it does not necessarily set aside any funds for this purpose. We believe this area needs an overhaul. Settlement 5.16 Another area of concern is in relation to the Inland Revenue’s ability to settle cases. Practitioners have consistent comments in relation to both pre-assessment settlements and settlements of challenge proceedings. Those comments revolve around inconsistency between Inland Revenue offices and Inland Revenue officers within an office, a lack of clarity about who the ultimate sign-off or decision maker is in a settlement, a perception that Inland Revenue officers still believe that a settlement is impossible except where it reflects that correct tax outcome, and concern that Inland Revenue officers seem unwilling to consider settlements which involve (for example) the reduction or elimination of use of money interest and penalties. 5.17 Some practitioners have said that the involvement of the Litigation Management Unit at the stage of challenge procedures is helpful (and in comparison how difficult it is to reach settlements during the disputes resolution procedures), but other have commented that the Litigation Management Unit seems unable to reach settlements without deferring to the Crown Law Office, something which causes significant delay, and is administratively burdensome. The Society and NZICA make suggestions below (at paragraph 5.21 and following) about Model Litigant guidelines. As a part of that process, we believe Inland Revenue should always consider settlement. 5.18 In a number of cases before the Courts the Inland Revenue has been consistently told that the Commissioner has the ability to settle cases like any other litigant - see for instance the Court of Appeal in C of IRv Auckland Gas Company Ltd (1999) 19 NZTC 15,027 and more recently in Accent Management Ltd v C of IR (No.2) (2007) 23 NZTC 21,366. Those cases confirm that the Inland Revenue can reach commercial settlements, can take into account litigation risk, and can reach settlements where those settlements do not necessarily correspond to the Inland Revenue’s view of the correct tax position. There is also no limitation on the Inland Revenue’s ability to settle including by way of a reduction or elimination of use of money interest and penalties. 5.19 The Commissioner issued a draft Standard Practice Statement ED0007 in 1999 in relation to settlements. Nine years later this has still not been finalised. It provided little guidance in any event, providing that: (a) Settlements must be based on the statutory criteria. (b) Settlements must be consistent with treatment of other taxpayers in a similar position. (c) Settlements must be consistent with the Commissioner's duty to collect, over time, the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law. (d) Any settlement must be based on a genuine dispute over facts or law, rather than expediency. 5.20 The Society and NZICA believe it is high time that the Inland Revenue provided guidance for Inland Revenue officials in relation to settlements. We believe that there 1780478: JZD 25 should be clear guidelines providing that Inland Revenue has the ability and can exercise its ability to settle a dispute both pre-assessment, in the course of the disputes resolution procedures, and during challenge proceedings. This guidance can be given by way of Standard Practice Statement which taxpayers can also access. Any such guidance must be consistent with the case law, and should provide a clear sign-off for settlements (so taxpayers know who to write to). Any such guidance needs to be consistently applied. And, as noted above, we believe that Inland Revenue should always consider settlement. We discuss this further below. Model litigant procedures 5.21 The Society and NZICA have been concerned at some of the recent case law relating to procedural aspects of the disputes resolution procedures. In that recent case law the Inland Revenue’s position has seemed unusual and potentially at odds with the purposes of the procedures. For instance: (a) In ANZ National Bank Ltd v C of IR (No. 2) (2006) 22 NZTC 19,835 the Inland Revenue seemed to argue that its own Adjudication Unit did not have the technical capability to consider complex tax matters, notwithstanding that the Taxpayer Rulings unit within the same office (the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel) had previously given rulings on similar transactions; (b) In Case X6 (2005) 22 NZTC 12,079 at paragraph 49 the Taxation Review Authority noted the commonplace nature of very procedural arguments from the Inland Revenue: Cases in this jurisdiction have become commonplace where taxpayers have been prevented from ever having the merits of their dispute determined by a hearing authority because of failure to comply with some procedural requirement ...........In the former case, the taxpayer is thus far (pending a further appeal) prevented from defending an allegation of fraud because of a highly technical analysis of the relevant procedural steps. This case is a further such example. 5.22 In Australia, all Government departments are required to act as “Model Litigants”. We have included a copy of those requirements as Appendix C. In broad terms, these require that departments should: (a) Not cause unnecessary delay in the handling of litigation. (b) Act consistently. (c) Endeavour to avoid, prevent and limit the scope of legal proceedings wherever possible, for example by the use of alternative dispute resolution processes. (d) Keep the costs of any litigation to a minimum. (e) Not take advantage of claimants who lack the resources to litigate a claim. (f) Not rely on technical defences. (g) Not pursue an appeal unless it believes that it has reasonable prospects for success or the appeal is otherwise justified in the public interest. 1780478: JZD 26 (h) Apologise where it is clear that it has acted wrongfully or improperly. 5.23 For these guidelines to be effective in Australia, each Government department is independently reviewed. In New Zealand, this would require an entity which is able to act independently of Crown Law, as Crown Law undertakes Inland Revenue’s litigation. The State Services Commission could perhaps be considered in the New Zealand context. 5.24 As part of a Model Litigant model for New Zealand, we suggest that the Inland Revenue should formally consider a number of options before pursuing litigation: (a) Proactive consideration of settlement (unfortunately in our experience this does not take place); (b) Test cases; (c) Mediation; (d) Legislative change - and in this area there should be concession to the taxpayer if the legislation is drafted with a complete lack of clarity, and legislative amendment where necessary. 5.25 In many cases, ordinary legal proceedings will be the only option. However, the Inland Revenue should consider the other options, as these will have a place in many disputes. The size of the current Revenue Acts have mushroomed and the quality of the legislation and consultation has at times suffered. Increasingly of late, officials have relied on “base maintenance” amendments to correct drafting errors. As a result of this, the legislation becomes uncertain. Taxpayers should not be penalised for taking positions which are the result of uncertain or unclear legislation. 1780478:JZD 27 Appendix A Appendix A: The costs of the procedures and the impact on tax litigation As outlined in our paper, the Society and NZICA consider that a current tax dispute processes impose a high level of costs. This is reflected in the pattern of court usage and Inland Revenue’s costs. The Richardson Committee noted in 1994, that in a six month sample period in 1991 the median amount of tax in dispute for a sample of cases over a six month period was $5,000 for objections, and $20,000 cases filed3. We are unable to compare this to any current statistics as the cost of the processes are so high, that taxpayers very rarely get to the stage that they take the matter to dispute unless there is a considerable amount is at stake. There are a large number of New Zealand businesses and individuals that are “small” in tax terms. In New Zealand, 89% of New Zealand enterprises employ five or fewer staff4. In the United States of America (“USA”) these are regarded as “micro” businesses. In the USA, enterprises that have less than 100 employees are regarded as “small”. In New Zealand 99.54% of New Zealand enterprises are “small” in USA terms. Similarly, there are a large number of individuals who are also “small” in tax terms. It is not possible to produce statistics to show how many people are not willing to proceed due to the high costs involved. All that can be shown is the large decline in the number of people prepared to use the Courts. For example5: Number of hearings Taxation Review Authority through the / Inland R evenue Financial Year Total 1/7/1995-30/6/199664 1/7/1996-30/6/199764 1/7/1997-30/6/1998 60 1/7/1998-30/6/199921 1/7/1999-30/6/200045 1/7/2000 - 30/6/200124 1/7/2001 -30/6/200219 1/7/2002 - 30/6/2003 29 1/7/2003 - 30/6/2004 26 1/7/2004-30/6/200514 1/7/2005 - 30/6/200613 This now suggests that very few people are prepared to go to Court, particularly when then are small amounts in dispute. This does not mean that people no longer have disputes with Inland Revenue for small amounts of tax - it just means that there is no forum for those cases to be heard, where the tax dispute cannot be heard for less than the cost of the disputes process. This has been regarded as a victory6 - The current process would appear to a significant extent to be meeting its objectives because the number of audited cases that are disputed is decreasing and the cases that are being litigated are also decreasing. 3 Refer Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department April 1994 at page 66. 4 Refer to the Feb 2007 statistics - http://www.stats.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/8BE43774-521C-481E- A97F-933285CD7D88/22502/NZBDS2007alltabls.xls 5 This information came from an OIA request to Litigation Management Unit of Inland Revenue 6 Refer to the discussion document Resolving Tax Disputes: A legislative review paragraphs 1.7 & 1.8. 1780478: JZD 28 In 1997, the proportion of audited cases giving rise to a dispute was two percent of total cases. This figure dropped to 0.91 percent in 2002. The decrease suggests that the disputes process, combined with Inland Revenue’s audit selection process, is reducing the number of disputed cases. In our view, what is not shown by the decrease in the number of cases heard by the Taxation Review Authority, are the costs of bringing a dispute. We are not able to provide accurate statistical details that demonstrate the increase in taxpayer’s costs to take a matter to court. However, the other side of those expenses are the costs incurred by the Litigation Management Unit of Inland Revenue. Those costs are lower than the costs incurred by taxpayers, as the preparation and management of the documents form the disputes resolution procedures are undertaken by other parts of the Inland Revenue. However Litigation Management does have a review role in relation to Statements of Position issued by Inland Revenue. Litigation Management’s costs have also spiralled since the introduction of the disputes system in 1996. Inland Revenue no longer provides the details of the cases under management and the cases it took to court in its Annual Report. For example, the cost of the Litigation Management Unit in 1999 was $5,449,000. This compares with a cost of $7,300,000 in 2006 when it took 26 cases to court. In addition to the high costs of the current process, there is a considerable barrier in terms of the procedure involved. In the Society’s and NZICA’s view: • The current disputes resolution system is an abject failure in how it handles small disputes. • Based on the information supplied by the Richardson Committee, the vast majority of disputes are for small amounts. • The costs involved in disputing a matter have now increased to such a stage that it is no longer financial viable for people to dispute small amounts with the Inland Revenue. • Most taxpayers in New Zealand are “small” (or micro in USA terms) and the amounts in dispute are for small amounts. The current disputes resolution procedures fail the majority of taxpayers. 1780478: JZD 29 Appendix A Privy Council/Supreme TRA High Court Court of Appeal Court Started/ Total Cases Started/ Total Cases Started/ Total Cases Started/ Total Cases Total Cases Started/ Total Cases Cost of Litigation IRD's Figures Cost per Cost per Case Case Managed Disposed Heard Managed Disposed Heard Managed Disposed Heard Managed Disposed Heard Managed Disposed Heard Mgmt (perOIA) Managed Heard 1996\*93 16044 546537 05 501 1 14723187 1997\* 120 1174080 5716 055 011 200180 62$3,416,334 199849 5827 26 08 1 7693$4,427,882 1999 294 38393 22 019 0 68779 $5,449,000 $4,394,167 $7,931.59 $68,974.68 2000 228 31205 17 0 400 433 52 $5,056,000$4,650,530 $11,676.67$97,230.77 2001140 29156250929663 $4,723,000$4,247,601 $15,956.08$74,968.25 2002 15 16432135 $5,039,000 $15,697.82$143,971.43 2003225 16 26681349137 $5,881,000 $11,977.60$158,945.95 2004 56910952 $7,060,000 $12,407.73$135,769.23 2005$8,066,000 200626 $7,300,000 $280,769.23 2007 $9,679,000 2008 \* Note that there is a different method of recording cases commenced in 1999, in 1996 & 1997 this was based on cases filed.

FOREWORD TEST CASE LITIGATION PROGRAM ABOUT THE TEST CASE LITIGATION PROGRAM PURPOSE The purpose of the Test Case Litigation Program is to clarify the operation of the laws administered by the Commissioner of Taxation where: ■ there is uncertainty or contention about the operation of areas of law \* the issue is of significance to a substantial segment of the public or has significant commercial implications for an industry segment, and m it is in the public interest for the issue to be litigated. In applying these criteria: ■ cases with issues involving questions of fact where there are established legal principles will not generally be funded a the program will usually be directed to applications for cases being litigated through Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953. Part IVC allows for the review of a Commissioner’s decision on an objection to an assessment or a private ruling, an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) or a court from the Commissioner’s decision on an objection, or a subsequent appeal from an AAT or court decision. Preference for the program is given to court cases rather than AAT cases. Cases outside of the Part IVC regime involving debt issues, applications for declaratory relief, and judicial review issues, will be considered for funding where an important law clarification issue arises r consideration will be given to the degree to which the . taxpayer is prepared to cooperate to achieve an early hearing a the financial capacity of the taxpayer to pursue litigation will be taken into consideration, although applicants of financial substance will not necessarily be excluded, and ■ cases involving tax avoidance schemes or attempts to gain a benefit clearly not intended by the law will not generally be funded. Cases will be considered for funding where they test the proper meaning of anti-avoidance provisions or where the circumstances are such that there is a strong public interest served. FUNDING FURTHER APPEALS Given the nature of the issues covered by the program, funding will generally extend to appeals against funded decisions, at least to the Full Federal Court. (Where cases are approved for funding in state or territory courts, funding will generally extend to the Court of Appeal or equivalent in the relevant Supreme Court). A fresh application for funding will need to be made at each stage of proceedings, to enable the funding decision to take into account the nature of the issue being tested and the terms of the decision applicants are seeking to appeal. IDENTIFICATION OF CASES Generally, cases will arise through applications for funding from taxpayers appealing a decision by the Commissioner of Taxation. These applications go to the Tax Office’s Test Case Litigation Panel which makes recommendations about whether funding should be provided. Submissions may also be made by, for example, a professional or industry body to have a matter of significance tested. Typically, in these cases, in principle agreement is sought to the matter being tested and a case being identified for this purpose (see ‘Approval in principle to develop a case’ on page 8). These applications also go to the Tax Office’s Test Case Litigation Panel. Similarly, the Commissioner of Taxation may decide to test a matter and seek agreement from a taxpayer to proceed with the case. This may involve seeking the assistance of a professional or industry body to identify a suitable case. There are also cases where the Commissioner offers to meet the taxpayer’s costs on an appeal, in important cases, without an application for funding being provided. Although they are an important part of the Commissioner’s Test Case Litigation Program, these cases do not usually goto the Tax Office’s Test Case Litigation Panel, except for information. 2 • TEST CASE LITIGATION PROGRAM DECISION MAKING PROCESS You can apply for fundingfoy completing the application form at the end of this guide and attaching it to a submission (see. ‘Prepare a submission’ on page 10). You must prepare a submission in order to apply for test case funding. You need to provide the details of the case, the factual background and a full summary of the issues to be tested. Your submission must show how the issue in question relates to an area of the tax law that needs clarification and how it affects a significant number of other taxpayers. The significance of the case should be clear from the submission, including the amount of revenue that will be affected by the case, if that is known. It is intended that, over time, the program will help build a body of legal precedent that will serve as a rule for future similar cases. Therefore, cases that are brought before a court, rather than the AAT, are preferred. However, cases before the AAT or Small Taxation Claims Tribunal can still be considered for funding, particularly where the case is to be heard by a Presidential Member. The submission and any supporting materials will normally be considered by the Test Case Litigation Panel (the panel) when it next convenes. The panel generally convenes about four times a year. Generally, a decision will be made within three months of your application being received. If your application appears plainly deficient for any reason, we may contact you to give you the opportunity to provide more information before your application is submitted to the panel, so you can present your best case. Once a fully supported application is received, comments will be sought from internal Tax Office sources, which may include the relevant business line, the Legal Services Branch and the Tax . Counsel Network. Any written comments received will form part of.the papers that will be forwarded to the panel. The panel will consider whether or not your written application and the supporting documentation meet the specific criteria. A recommendation to approve or decline funding is then made to the Chair of the panel, who makes the final decision. Decisions about test case funding can also be made by a number of senior staff in the Tax Office, including the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner, or a Deputy Chief Tax Counsel. The Senior Tax Counsel (Strategic Litigation) is the Chair of the panel, and is ordinarily the officer to make the final decision about funding. Depending on the strength of the application, a decision can be made without reference to the panel. This will happen where your application is to be approved due to the important issues that are raised, or where there is some greater urgency. A decision may also be made to decline your application without reference to the panel where a decision needs to be made urgently, such as where the case will go to hearing before the next panel meeting. You will then be advised in writing of the decision, with reasons. If your application is declined, funding will not be given. A decision to approve funding does not give rise to an automatic legal right to funding - an agreement about the terms of funding has to then be reached. You will be sent a draft Test Case Funding Agreement setting out the terms and conditions upon which funding is offered and you will need to consider that offer carefully before responding or accepting. TEST CASE UnGATION PROGRAM TEST CASE LITIGATION PANEL The Test Case Litigation Panel consists of members of the accounting and legal professions, as well as senior tax officers. ■ The panel considers the applications according to tine program’s criteria, and recommends to the Chair of the panel - the Senior Tax Counsel (Strategic Litigation) - whether or not funding is appropriate. The panel considers applications with respect to both actual cases and issues where no case has yet been identified. The panel was formed with the intention of providing community input. Representatives from the accounting and legal professions provide independent views on the merits of cases and on the significance of issues to the community. 4 TEST CASE LITIGATION PROGRAM FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS Following your acceptance of the offer setting out the terms and conditions upon, which funding will be provided, we will let you know the name of the test case funding contact officer allocated to your case. This officer will not be involved in the conduct of the actual case on behalf of the Commissioner - a different officer will be allocated to that role. Funding is available to taxpayers who: m have successfully applied and been approved for funding under the program for a case that is in a court or tribunal, or m have successfully applied and been approved for funding in principle under the program for a case to be located and/or developed for court (see ‘Approval in principle to develop a case’ on page 8). TYPES OF FUNDING There are broadly three kinds of funding arrangements that the Tax Office enters into under the program: 1 a consent order under which the Commissioner pays the other party’s costs 2 a-written offer to reimburse the other party’s costs on specific terms, or 3 a formal agreement to providing lunding under a Test Case Deed. The most common type of funding is under a Test Case Deed. 1 Cost orders: When the Federal Court, for example, makes an order as to costs, the costs are generally read as a reference to party/party costs (unless it specifies otherwise). The Commissioner’s liability for costs awarded against him will follow the ordinary court process, including taxation of costs where necessary. Similarly, in other courts, the Commissioner will be liable for costs on the basis assessed by the courts under their own processes. Generally, the costs can be met on the basis of an itemised account submitted to the Commissioner’s solicitor, or they may be settled by agreement between the parties. Nonetheless, as this category of funding is entirely within the domain of the relevant court process, it will not be further discussed in this guide. You should seek the advice of your solicitor or counsel if you need more information. 2 Written offers: Offers of funding by way of a letter offering to reimburse specific costs have been less frequently used in recent times. However, it may still be used in a situation where, for example, the Commissioner provides funding retrospectively following an internal review process (see 'What happens if my application is declined?’ on page 7). 3 Test Case Deed: Generally speaking, under the Commissioner’s Test Case Deed, when a case goes to hearing and a decision is provided by the court, it is agreed that the parties will request orders that costs be paid in accordance with the deed. The taxpayer's costs will be assessed having regard to the terms of the deed rather than the usual rules of the court. This is usually dealt with directly between our funding contact officer and the taxpayer’s solicitor. In the event of a dispute or doubt, the Commissioner may seek the guidance of an independent cost consultant. If costs cannot be agreed, costs may be taxed under the process provided by the particular court. WHAT DOES THE TEST CASE DEED COVER? When you receive written advice that your application has been approved, an offer of funding will usually be provided at the same time, in the form of a deed. You should consider the deed fully and carefully. You should not rely on this guide to understand the particular deed that has been sent to you - you should obtain independent legal advice about the content of the deed. The deed provided to you will specify rates at which we will reimburse your costs for the members of your legal team, it will also detail the basis for reimbursing the cost of disbursements. The deed generally'offers funding of reasonable costs incurred at the approved stage of litigation on a soiicitor/client basis, subject to certain limits. The Commissioner will only provide funding for reasonably sized teams, having regard to the relative complexity of the matter. The basis for calculating costs under the deed generally results in a higher amount of costs being paid to the taxpayer than would be the case if the costs were taxed on a party/party basis by the Federal Court of Australia. However, there are limits on the monetary rates paid to solicitors and counsel. Your legal team may not be entitled to the full commercial rates they may wish to be paid, notwithstanding that the case is test-case- funded. Reimbursement is limited to the amounts specified under the deed, which means you may need to pay the balance of your legal advisers’ costs, Subject to the terms and conditions of the deed, funded taxpayers will receive reimbursements for: ■ solicitor fees a counsel fees, and ■ disbursements. TEST CASE UTIGATION PROGRAM 5 FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS Solicitor fees The deed will only reimburse solicitor fees up to a certain rate. These rates are provided by the Tax Office and are determined by reference to the rates the Commissioner pays for legal services. Counsel fees Under the program, the Tax Office will fund no more than the same number and seniority of counsel that the Tax Office itself will engage to conduct the test case. For example, if we brief one junior counsel, we will only reimburse you for the cost of engaging one junior counsel to represent you. We will reimburse you for counsel fees according to the general Australian Government rate, as determined pursuant to the Legal Services Directions issued by the Attorney General’s Department. Where your counsel has been approved by the Attorney General’s Department for a specific Australian Government rate, they will receive that rate. WHAT ABOUT NON-LEGAL COSTS? Generally, test case funding is limited to legal costs: that is, the costs of preparing and conducting a case for litigation. However, when fending has been approved to find and develop a case for litigation, the Commissioner will consider approving the costs of preparing objections and private binding rulings. This preparation may require the assistance of your accountant or tax agent. If you seek this type of funding, you should support your application with a proposal of the types of costs you anticipate will be incurred and the estimated costs of the total work to be done. This material should.accompany your submission. Any costs that are agreed will be set out in the Test Case Deed that will be sent to you with the offer of funding. FUNDING REVIEW AND TERMINATION The Tax Office may review and terminate funding at any time if you breach any condition of the funding offer as set out in the deed. Disbursements Normal disbursements (such as photocopying, facsimiles and telephone costs) are limited to $500. Disbursements such as filing fees, witnesses’ expenses and other such disbursements covered by the deed will be reimbursed separately and are not covered by the $500 limit. O NOTE Funding under the program may not ccver all your expenses in running the case. WHAT COSTS ARE NOT COVERED BY TEST CASE FUNDING? Some of the items the program will not cover include fees and disbursements that: ■ are unreasonable in amount or unreasonably incurred a are above the set rates provided in the deed ■ are not directly related to the test case m relate to your application for funding ■ are incurred after the decision is handed down for the test case . a relate to some travel costs a are for the litigation of issues not agreed upon, or ■ relate to the preparation of bills of costs. DO I HAVE TO RE-APPLY IF I WANT TO APPEAL TH E COURT’S DECISION OF MY TEST CASE? Yes. The Test Case Deed applies to a single stage only. However, if you have been funded at one stage, your application for funding for an appeal will generally be favourably considered, at least to the Full Federal Court (or where cases are approved in state or territory courts, to the relevant Court of Appeal in the relevant Supreme Court). For example, if your case in the Federal Court is funded and the decision is not in your favour, you will need to make a further application for funding should you decide to appeal to the Full Federal Court. If funding is approved to the next stage, a new deed will be offered that will update the agreed rates for solicitors and counsel (if necessary) and will also review the key issues that are to be considered by the court on appeal. WHAT TYPES OF CONDITIONS ARE THERE ON FUNDING? There are many conditions and obligations set out in the Test Case Deed that you need to carefully consider before agreeing to the deed. A number of key issues that you will probably notice in the terms of the deed include the following: m You are expected to take the particular stage of the case to its conclusion. This may require you to supplement the cost of litigation with your own funds, to the extent that the funding provided does not fully indemnify you for your costs. b If the case does not proceed on the agreed issues outlined in the deed, due to actions by you or your legal representatives, funding will not be provided in relation to the preparation for - and conduct of - the test case proceedings, and we may ask you to refund money that has already been paid to you. 6 TEST CASE LITIGATION PROGRAM 4 FUNDING ARFiANGEMENTS ■ Any funding that is paid to you or your representatives must only be spent on the legal expenses related to the conduct of your case. ■ If you are successful in the test case, you will not seek costs orders against the Tax Office, other than orders in the form set out in the deed. HOW DO I CLAIM A REIMBURSEMENT FOR MY TEST CASE COSTS? The terms of the deed specify how and when claims can be made. Generally, once funding has been agreed, claims can be made every six months, or immediately after each significant court or tribunal appearance. Alternative payment arrangements may also be considered, and should be discussed with the test'case contact officer when an offer for funding is made. Accounts should be sent to: Test Case Program Senior Tax Counsel (Strategic Litigation) Legal Services Branch Office of the Chief Tax Counsel Australian Taxation Office GPO Box 9990 Sydney NSW 2001 Your legal adviser’s account must detail each item of work and the hourly or daily rate charged. All expended moneys must be itemised clearly, as would be done with a bill of costs submitted in taxable form. You can only claim expenses associated with the conduct of the case. For example, public relations costs will not be reimbursed. Q NOTE Invoices submitted to the Tax Office may be subject to a review by a cost consultant. To ensure there are no delays with payment of invoices, we ask that ali invoices submitted are in taxable form: that is, in the form required by court rules for costs assessment. TAX CONSEQUENCES There may be tax consequences if you claim a tax deduction for legal costs incurred in objecting or appealing against an. assessment or determination of the Commissioner.Any money received to recoup deductible expenditure under the program is assessable. WHAT HAPPENS IF MY APPLICATION IS DECLINED? If your application for funding is declined, you will be advised in writing with reasons. If you think that your application has not been properly considered or if there have been further developments in your case since you first lodged your application, you can request (in writing) a review of the decision to decline funding. The review is undertaken by a senior officer of the Tax Office. This process normally takes about one month and you will be advised in writing of the review decision. TEST CASE LITIGATION PROGRAM 7 OTHER CASES WE MAY FUND This guide generally covers the situation where a taxpayer has a case in the Federal Court or the AAT and seeks test case funding- in the ordinary way. However, there are other situations where v/e fund cases for law clarification. COMMISSIONER’S APPEAL AGAINST AAT CASES When the Commissioner appeals against a decision of the AAT or the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal, the Commissioner will generally consider funding the taxpayer's reasonable costs of the appeal. Funding under this category is offered at the Commissioner’s own volition without reference to the Test Case Litigation Panel. The purpose of this is to ensure that taxpayers can avail themselves of the low cost environment of the AAT without suffering the risk of litigation in the court system. Funding of this kind will be provided, depending on the merits of the case. Generally, we will have regard to the s'ize of the issue and the capacity of the taxpayer to meet legal costs. Funding is generally not available in cases involving tax avoidance schemes or attempts to gain a benefit clearly not intended by the law. The costs that will be funded will be subject to the terms and conditions set out in a deed that will be provided to you. As long as the Commissioner continues to appeal subsequent decisions, the offer of paying reasonable costs will continue, subject to agreement at each appeal stage about the terms of funding. If the taxpayer appeals the decision of the AAT or any subsequent decision of the court, we will not ordinarily fund those proceedings under this type of funding. If you are seeking funding, you will need to submit an application for test case funding in the usual way and it will be dealt with by the test Case Litigation Panel process. HIGH COURT CASES When the Commissioner seeks special leave to appeal to the High Court, and the particular issues in a case justify it, the Commissioner may, of his own volition, offer to meet the taxpayer’s costs of special leave and the costs of the appeal in the event that leave is granted by the High Court. This is done without reference to the Test Case Litigation Panel. These types of cases are usually funded by consenting to orders as to costs against the Commissioner. Those costs provided under this category are the usual reasonable party/ party costs that are calculated in accordance with the High Court’s rules. A taxpayer can apply for funding under the program in the usual way to receive the benefit of the costs that are paid under the deed. Such an application should be made well before the case is brought on for hearing of special leave. APPROVAL IN PRINCIPLE TO DEVELOP A CASE This category' refers to the situation where, a case has been identified that has the potential to test an important issue but further work is needed before it can be.litigated. On some occasions, funding may be provided for the costs (including non-legal costs) associated with developing the case, such as preparing the objection or private binding ruling request. You need to make an application for approval in principle before you incur the expenses involved in developing the case for litigation. Once a case has been identified, you need to lodge a submission for approval in principle to fond a case. The submission needs to include the following details: m the name and address of the applicant taxpayer, organisation or group m a description of the issue, and h details of how the case is intended to be developed for the purposes of bringing it before a court or the AAT. 8 TEST CASE LITIGATION PROGRAM OTHER CASES WE MAY FUND If you are seeking funding for preparing the objection or private binding ruling request, the application would need to establish that there are special circumstances. For example, there might be a situation where the value of the issue to the community would be high, but the cost to an individual of running a case would greatly exceed their potential.gain if the case was won. Before funding in principle will be granted, you will need to provide details of a proposed work plan and budget for developing the case. The work plan needs to describe each item of work, who is to perform the work and their qualifications, and the proposed timeframe for this work to be completed. The budget should show the number of hours or days expected to be spent on each item in the work plan. The work plan would also need to show the hourly and daily rates to be charged. APPROVAL IN PRINCIPLE TO FIND A CASE ON AN ISSUE If, for instance, an association has a tax issue of importance to its members, the association may seek approval in principle for the issue to be funded. This may occur before the association actually incurs the expenses in finding a case that will test the issue. You should send your application to the Tax Office, together with a submission setting out the required information (see ‘Prepare a submission’ on page 10). As this submission will be . prepared before an actual case can be considered by the Test Case Litigation Panel, it is particularly important to explain the legal principles that will be tested. Cases where the issues will ultimately be determined on the facts of the case, rather than test legal principles, will not generally be funded. You will be advised in writing if your application is supported. If you are granted an approval in principle to fund a case, you will be allocated a Tax Office contact officer to help you with your case. Once the case is ready for litigation, you need to make a request in writing to the Senior Tax Counsel (Strategic Litigation) to confirm funding. Your request should detail the case and refer to the approval-in-principle decision to fund. You will be sent a letter of offer and a Test Case Deed once a suitable vehicle for testing the issue is found. If you are seeking funding for the costs involved in finding a case, you need to: a establish that special circumstances exist, including that the costs associated with finding a case are relatively significant, and n provide details of a proposed work plan and budget for finding the case. TEST CASE LITIGATION PROGRAM 9 HOW TO APPLY FOR TEST CASE FUNDING COMPLETE AN APPLICATION FORM Taxpayers who want to apply for test case funding must provide - as a minimum - the information requested on the application form. This form is included at the end of this guide and is available electronically on our website at www.ato.gov.au The application form must be attached to the front page of your submission (see 'Prepare a submission’ below). If there is not . enough space on the application form, the detail should be provided in the body of your submission. PREPARE A SUBMISSION You need to prepare a submission in order to apply for test case funding. Your submission will be considered by the Test Case Litigation Panel, and is the supporting document to your application for funding your case. In line with the purpose of the Test Case Litigation Program, as explained at the beginning of this guide, your submission should address the following points: 1 How does the issue to be tested relate to an area of the tax law where there is uncertainty or contention? In dealing with this question, it is important to explain the legal principles to be tested. Issues involving questions of fact where there are established legal principles will not generally be funded. 2 How do you propose to bring this issue forward for testing? Preference is generally given to cases brought before courts rather than the MT, due to the aim of building a body of legal precedent with relatively limited public funding, in addition, the program would usually be directed to applications for cases being litigated through Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953. Part IVC allows for the review of a Commissioner’s decision on an objection to an assessment or a private ruling, an appeal to a court from an objection decision, or a subsequent appeal from the AAT or Federal Court. Cases outside the Part IVC regime will also be considered where an important law clarification issue arises. Such cases may include debt issues, applications for declaratory relief, and judicial review issues. 3 To what extent is the issue of significance to a substantial segment of the public, or does it have significant commercial implications for an industry segment? 4 Why is it in the public interest for the issue to be litigated? Cases involving tax avoidance schemes or attempts to gain a benefit clearly not intended by the law will not generally be funded. Cases will be considered for funding where they test ■ the proper meaning of anti-avoidance provisions or where the circumstances are such .that there is a strong public interest served. - 5 To what degree are you prepared to cooperate to achieve an early hearing? 6 What is your financial capacity to pursue litigation without the benefit of test case funding? Please note that applicants of financial substance will not necessarily be excluded. O note Your application will be considered on its merits. You should consider how best to present your application so that the Test Case Litigation Panel can fully appreciate the strength of your application against the criteria for funding. 10 TEST CASE LITIGATION PROGRAM MORE INFORMATION FEEDBACK For further information on this topic: \* visit our website at www.ato.gov.au ■ phone us on (02) 9374 2986, or a write to: Test Case Program Senior Tax Counsel (Strategic Litigation) Legal Services Branch Office of the Chief Tax Counsel Australian Taxation Office GPO Box 9990 Sydney NSW 2001 If you do not speak English well and want to talk to a tax officer, phone the Translating and Interpreting Service on 13 14 50 for help with your call.

A.5.2 The old (pre 1 March 2006) version of these rules is as follows: Directions on the Commonwealth^ obligation to act as a model litigant — Pre 1 March 2006 Version1^ 1. Consistently with the Attorney-General’s responsibility for the maintenance of proper standards in litigation, the Commonwealth and its agencies must behave as a model litigant in the conduct of litigation. Nature of the obligation 2. The obligation requires that the Commonwealth and its agencies act honestly and fairly in handling claims and litigation brought by or against the Commonwealth or an agency by: (a) dealing with claims promptly and not causing unnecessary delay in the handling of claims and litigation, (b) paying legitimate claims without litigation, including making partial settlements of claims Or interim payments, where it is clear that liability is at least as much as the amount to be paid, (c) acting consistently in the handling of claims and litigation, (d) endeavouring to avoid litigation, wherever possible, (e) where it is not possible to avoid litigation, keeping the costs of litigation to a minimum, including.by: (i) not requiring the other party to prove a matter http://www.igt.gov.au/content/reports/Litigation\_report/13\_litigation\_%20apx\_05.asp18/07/2008 which the Commonwealth or the agency knows to be" true, and (ii) not contesting liability if the Commonwealth or the agency knows that the dispute is really about quantum, (f) not taking advantage of a claimant who lacks the resources to litigate a legitimate claim, (g) not relying on technical defences unless the Commonwealth’s or the agency’s interests would be prejudiced by the failure to comply with a particular requirement, (h) not undertaking and pursuing appeals unless the Commonwealth or the agency believes that it has reasonable prospects for success or the appeal is otherwise justified in the public interest, and (i) apologising where the Commonwealth or the agency is aware that it or its lawyers have acted wrongfully or improperly, Notes: 1. The obligation applies to litigation (including before courts, tribunals, inquiries, and in arbitration and other alternative dispute resolution processes) involving Commonwealth Departments and agencies, as well as Ministers and officers where the Commonwealth provides a full indemnity in respect of an action for damages brought against them personally. Ensuring compliance with the obligation is primarily the responsibility of the agency which has responsibility for the litigation. In addition, lawyers engaged in such litigation, whether Australian Government Solicitor, in-house or private, will need to act in accordance with the obligation and to assist their client agency to do so. 2. In essence, being a model litigant requires that the Commonwealth and its agencies, as parties to litigation, act with complete propriety, fairly and in accordance with the highest professional standards. The expectation that the Commonwealth and its agencies will act as a model litigant has been recognised by the Courts. See, for example, Melbourne Steamship Limited v Moorhead (1912) 15 CLR 133 at 342; Kenny v State o f South Australia (1987) 46 SASR 268 at 273; Yong Jun Qin v The Minister fo r Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1997) 75 FCR 155. 3. The obligation to act as a model litigant may require more than merely acting honestly and in accordance with the law and court rules. It also goes beyond the requirement for lawyers to act in accordance with their ethical obligations. 4 4. The obligation does not prevent the Commonwealth and its agencies from acting firmly and properly to protect their interests. It does not therefore preclude all legitimate steps being taken to pursue claims by the http://www.igt.gov.au/content/reports/Litigation\_report/13\_litigation\_%20apx\_05.asp 18/07/2008 where it is necessary to avoid prejudice to the interests of the Commonwealth or an agency pending the receipt or proper consideration of legal advice, provided that a decision whether to continue the appeal is made as soon as practicable. In certain circumstances, it will be appropriate for the Commonwealth to pay costs (for example, for a test case in the public interest.) NOTE 5. The obligation does not prevent the Commonwealth from enforcing costs orders or seeking to recover its costs. Merits review proceedings 3. The obligation to act as a model litigant extends to agencies involved in merits review proceedings. 4. An agency should use its best endeavours to assist the tribunal to make its decision. NOTE. The term 'litigation' is defined in paragraph 15 of these Directions in terms that encompass merits review before tribunals. There are particular obligations in relation to assisting a tribunal engaged in merits review to arrive at a decision. Agencies should pay close attention to the legislation under which a tribunal is established, and any practice directions issued by the tribunal. In the case of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal see in particular subsection 33(1 AA) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal A ct 1975 and the explanatory memorandum to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill 2005. Alternative dispute resolution 5. When participating in alternative dispute resolution, the Commonwealth and its agencies are to: (a) participate fully and effectively, and (b) wherever practicable, ensure that their representatives have authority to settle the matter, or at least clear instructions on the possible terms of settlement that would be acceptable to the Commonwealth, so as to facilitate appropriate and timely resolution of a dispute. NOTE 1. When participating in alternative dispute resolution processes, regard is still to be had to the requirements for settling major claims under paragraph 4.4 and Appendix C. In practical terms, this may mean that a representative attending an alternative dispute resolution process may not be able to be given authority to settle a matter to finality. This is to be made clear to the other party when discussing the use of this process. NOTE 2. Agencies are encouraged to develop dispute management plans addressing the place of litigation and alternative strategies in addressing disputes. http://www.igt.gov.au/content/reports/Litigation\_report/13\_litigation\_%20apx\_05.asp 18/07/2008 — Attorney-General, Legal Services Directions, Appendix B, issued pursuant to section 55ZF of the Judiciary Act 1903, with effect from 1 September 1999.

The Tax Office conducts and manages its litigation in accordance with its obligations under the law, the Attorney-General's Legal Services Directions 2005 (in particular the Mode! Litigant Obligation), relevant Court and Tribunal rules and directions, and other relevant internal and external policies and guidelines. The Tax Office strives to have all disputes brought to finality in a fair, timely and equitable manner consistent with the law. In taxation disputes, the Tax Office argues its cases consistently with its published view of the tax law. The Tax Office recognises that recourse to the Courts and Tribunals not only provides final, fair and independent resolution of disputes, it will in some cases, achieve law clarification benefits for Government and the community. 2. This practice statement should be read in conjunction with the following: • PS LA 2005/22 Litigation and priority technical issues • PS LA 2007/2 Management of Decisions of Courts and Tribunals • PS LA 2007/15 Briefing Counsel • PS LA 2007/16 Risk Management in litigation • PS LA 2007/17 Tax technical litigation in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal • PS LA 2007/18 Tax technical litigation in Federal Court matters • PS LA 2007/19 Tax technical litigation in High Court matters, and • PS LA 2007/12 Alternative Disputes Resolution in Tax Office disputes and litigation. Litigation to which this practice statement applies 3. This practice statement applies to all civil litigation in which the Commissioner is a party. Principles that guide our conduct 4. In conducting litigation the Tax Office is guided by the following principles: (i) the Commissioner in his statutory functions under the executive arm of government has a role to administer various laws enacted by Parliament, such as those related to taxation and superannuation. Consistent with this, the Tax Office will conduct and manage its litigation as a model litigant in accordance with its obligations under the law, the Attorney-General's Legal Services Directions 2005 (in particular the model litigant obligation), relevant court and tribunal rules and directions, and other relevant internal and external policies and guidelines (ii) the model litigant obligation does not prevent the Commissioner from acting firmly http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/print.htni7DocIDsPSR%2FPS200712%2FNAT%2FATO... 18/07/2008 PS LA 2007/12 - Conduct of Tax Office Litigation in Courts and Tribunals Page 3 of 16 and properly to protect its interests (iii) the litigation function of the Tax Office will have as its strategic focus the desire to obtain law clarification in a timely way providing greater certainty for the community (iv) the Tax Office has as an underlying value in its administration, respect for the rule of law. It follows that this value applies in the conduct of litigation, the resolution of disputes and in managing the outcome of judicial decisions (v) the Tax Office seeks to promote an environment • where people have a reasonable understanding of their rights and obligations or can readily obtain adequate guidance • where in practice the law can be complied with voluntarily • where the law is applied and enforced fairly; and where disputes about the law's operation can be resolved expeditiously.2 In keeping with this, the Tax Office respects and supports the rights of taxpayers to access appropriate review processes to achieve final, fair and independent resolution of disputes (vi) the Tax Office has a continuing commitment to a public interest Test Case Litigation Program through which taxpayers can be provided with financial support in appropriate circumstances to achieve law clarification (vii) an objective of the Tax Office litigation function is to assist decision makers in making well reasoned and supportable decisions so as to avoid unnecessary litigation ^ (viii) the Tax Office will argue its cases consistently with Tax Office published views of the law (ix) in determining the Tax Office view of the law the Tax Office adopts a 'purposive' approach to statutory construction, consistent with the statutory requirement3 and guidance of the High Court4. For practical purposes this means that where the words of the Act and their statutory context allow, a view of the law that reflects the underlying policy is preferred. (x) the Tax Office will risk assess litigation cases to ensure that cases are appropriately managed. All cases will have appropriately capable teams marshalled to conduct litigation. In particular, cases that will examine 'priority technical issues' will be identified and escalated in accordance with corporate practice guidelines (xi) the Tax Office will be consistent, yet vigorous, firm and efficient in the conduct of litigation. Where possible and appropriate, emphasis will be placed on resolving disputes through consultation, negotiation, mediation and formal alternative dispute resolution process available through tribunals and courts to avoid unnecessary litigation (xii) the Tax Office aims to resolve disputes in a fair and timely manner, consistent with the law (xiii) consistent with the model litigant obligation, the Tax Office aims to handle its cases efficiently and effectively in accordance with its responsibility to the community to deal responsibly with public revenue and also to fulfil their responsibilities to other litigants and the justice system (xiv) the Tax Office will not adopt an unnecessarily adversarial approach particularly in http ://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/print.htm?DocID=PSR%2FPS200712%2FNAT%2FATO... 18/07/2008 PS LA 2007/12 - Conduct of Tax Office Litigation in Courts and Tribunals Page 4 of 16 http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/print.htm?DocID=PSR%2FPS200712%2FNAT%2FATO... 18/07/2008 tribunal matters where the taxpayer is unrepresented (xv) the Tax Office will show appropriate deference to the decisions of Courts and quasi-judicial decisions, but reserves the right to exercise appeal rights and review and clarify the law through litigation consistently with the model litigant obligation (xvi) the Tax Office will foster effective relationships with the courts, tribunals and other parts of the legal system (xvii) the Tax Office will foster a close working relationship with the Attorney-General's department (xviii) the Tax Office will seek to gain value for money from the provision of external legal services, and (xix) Tax Office staff will have the range of skills and competencies appropriate to support its litigation strategy. EXPLANATION External rules, policies and guidelines Court and Tribunal rules 5. All Tax Officers must follow the various rules and practice directions of the relevant Court or Tribunal in which the proceedings are held. 6. Rules and practice directions of the various Courts and Tribunals are set out on their web sites and must be reviewed and understood by the litigation team, particularly the Legal Services Branch (LSB) officers. These include: • Practice Directions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal • Rules of the various State Courts • Rules of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission • Rules and Practice Directions of the Federal Court, and • Rules of the High Court. 7. Of particular importance is the requirement under subsection 33(1 AA) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 which requires decision-makers to use their best endeavours to assist the Tribunal to make the 'correct and preferable' decision according to law in the proceedings. The object of the requirement is to allow the Tribunal to conduct its reviews as efficiently as possible. Legal Services Directions 8. The Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (FMA Act) provides a framework for the proper management of public money and public property. As a Commonwealth agency, the Commissioner has a responsibility under section 44 of the FMA Act to promote efficient, effective and ethical use of Commonwealth resources. This includes a responsibility to properly manage the spending of public money on legal services. 9. The Attorney-General has issued (under section 55ZF of the Judiciary Act 1903) the Legal Services Directions 2005 (the Legal Services Directions) which are legally binding on agencies, including the Tax Office, subject to the FMA Act (called FMA Agencies) on a number of issues, including: PS LA 2007/12 - Conduct of Tax Office Litigation in Courts and Tribunals Page 5 of 16 • Tied Areas of Commonwealth Legal Work • The Commonwealth's Obligation to Act as a Model Litigant • Handling Monetary Claims • The Engagement of Counsel, and • Assistance to Employees for Legal Proceedings. The Legal Services Directions and information about the Directions can be accessed from www.ag.gov.au/olsc. 10. The Directions help to ensure that Commonwealth agencies receive consistent and well coordinated legal services that are of a high standard, that uphold the public interest and that are sensitive to their context of Commonwealth interests which are broader than any one agency. 11. LSB officers must have a detailed understanding of the Legal Services Directions and ensure that they are followed by all members of the litigation team including all tax officers and any external legal providers. Obligation to act as a model litigant 12. The Attorney-General, as First Law Officer, is responsible for the maintenance of proper standards in Commonwealth litigation and accordingly requires that the Commonwealth behave as a model litigant in the conduct of its litigation. The requirement for Government litigants to act as model litigants is set out in Appendix B to the Legal Services Directions. The Directions largely restate duties and codes of behaviour that have always been expected of government and its agencies by the courts.5 13. In essence, being a model litigant requires that the Commonwealth, as a party to litigation, acts with propriety, fairness and in accordance with the highest professional standards. The obligation applies to the handling of civil claims and litigation before the Courts, Tribunals, Inquiries and in Alternative Dispute Resolution processes. The model litigant obligation requires Commonwealth litigants to handle their cases efficiently and effectively, in accordance with their responsibility to the community to deal responsibly with public revenue and also to fulfil their responsibilities to other litigants and the justice system. 14. The obligation to act as a model litigant does not prevent the Commonwealth from acting properly to protect the Commonwealth's interests. It does not therefore preclude the Commonwealth from taking all legitimate steps in pursuing claims by it and testing or defending claims against it.6 The obligation not to pursue an appeal without reasonable prospects of success is not intended to prevent the Commonwealth from lodging notice of appeal to assess whether or not to pursue the matter. It does not preclude pursuing litigation in order to clarify a significant point of law even if the other party wishes to settle the dispute. The commencement of an appeal may be justified in the public interest where it is necessary to avoid prejudice to the interests of the Commonwealth or an agency pending the receipt or proper consideration of legal advice, provided that a decision whether to continue the appeal is made as soon as practicable.7 15. The model litigant obligation is to be drawn to the attention of counsel acting on behalf of the Commonwealth so that they understand the standards required of them. Counsel to comply with their taxation obligations 16. All counsel briefed directly by the Tax Office or on its behalf, must understand that they are required to comply with their taxation obligations. Any issues which arise out of this obligation must be discussed between Counsel and the LSB officer prior to the acceptance of the brief. 17. As of 1 March 2006, the new clause 4A of Appendix D of the Legal Services Directions mandates that: A brief issued to counsel is to contain a condition that, in accepting the brief, counsel is taken to warrant that he or she has not, at any time, been declared bankrupt, unless counsel advises of any such bankruptcy. http ://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/print.htm?DocID=PSR%2FPS200712%2FNAT%2FATO... 18/07/2008 PS LA 2007/12 - Conduct of Tax Office Litigation in Courts and Tribunals Page 6 of 16 18. Thus, all direct briefs and all briefs delivered by an external legal provider on behalf of the Tax Office must contain the following paragraphs: The Attorney-General has made it clear to all Commonwealth Departments and Agencies that it is expected that the Commonwealth will not engage counsel who use insolvency as a means of avoiding tax. In accordance with paragraph 4A of Appendix D of the Legal Services Directions 2005, counsel is taken to warrant, unless he or she advises to the contrary, that he or she has not, at any time, been declared bankrupt. Additionally, the Commissioner of Taxation does not wish to engage Counsel who are not complying with their taxation obligations. If you have any concerns about these requirements or wish to discuss any aspect of them please do not hesitate to contact your instructor. Breach of the Legal Services Directions 19. The Office of Legal Services Co-Ordination (OLSC) is part of the Attorney-General's Department, and is responsible for monitoring possible breaches of the Legal Services Directions, including the model litigant obligation. They do this in a number of ways, including: • by monitoring reports of case law and tribunal decisions • by receiving reports from agencies and legal service providers • from courts and tribunals, and • by receiving complaints from other parties to litigation involving the Commonwealth. 20. Paragraph 11.1 (d) of the Legal Services Directions provides that the Chief Executive of an FMA agency is responsible for ensuring that 'the agency gives reports as soon as practicable to the Attorney-General or OLSC about any possible or apparent breaches of the Directions by the agency, or.allegations of breaches by the agency of which the agency is aware, and about any corrective steps that have been taken or are proposed to be taken, by the agency'. The Chief Executive of an FMA agency is responsible for giving to OLSC, within 60 days after the end of each financial year, a certificate setting out the extent to which the Chief Executive believes there has been compliance by the agency with the Directions. 21. Guidance Note 3 of 2006 (guidance on reporting breaches of the Directions) and Guidance Note 4 of 2006 (guidance about the investigation of breaches) issued by OLSC8 can be found on the Attorney- General's website at www.ag.gov.au/oisc. Internal escalation process for breaches of the Legal Services Directions 22. The Commissioner reports breaches of the Legal Services Directions to OLSC via the ATO General Counsel. 23. A complaint received about our conduct or any instance where a Tax Officer is aware of a breach or an allegation of a breach by the Commissioner of the Legal Service Directions, should be reported to the ATO General Counsel. The ATO General Counsel will ensure that the allegation is investigated, and where appropriate provide a report to OLSC. APS Values and the Code of Conduct 24. Sections 10 and 13 of the Public Service Act 1999 set out the Australian Public Service (APS) Values and Code of Conduct. They are supported by the Public Service Commissioner's Directions. All APS employees are required to uphold the APS Values and comply with the Code of Conduct, with sanctions available for breaches of the Code. Agency Heads and members of the Senior Executive Service are required to promote and uphold the APS Values. 25. The APS Values and Code of Conduct cover all APS employees and Agency Heads. The principles set out give guidance on personal behaviour as well as on relationships and behaviours between: • APS employees and the Government and the Parliament http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/print.htm?DocID=PSR%2FPS200712%2FNAT%2FATO... 18/07/2008 PS LA 2007/12 - Conduct of Tax Office Litigation in Courts and TribunalsPage 7 of 16 • APS employees and the public, and • APS employees and colleagues in the workplace 26. A publication of the Australian Public Service Commission APS Values and Code of Conduct in practice assists APS employees to understand the practical application of the APS Values and Code of Conduct in both common and unusual circumstances. The publication is a guide not a rulebook. It provides a useful summary of important legal requirements across the APS, although it does not attempt to be comprehensive. Internal policies and guidelines 27. There are a number of internal Tax Office policies and guidelines which are relevant to the conduct of litigation. All tax officers should be aware of and consider the application of these policies and guidelines to the litigation. These policies and guidelines include: • Panel firm or AGS/ATO Memorandum of Understanding • Legal Services Branch Bulletins • Corporate Management and Law Administration Practice Statements • Taxpayers' Charter • Code of Settlement Practice • Access and Information Gathering Manual, and • Public Rulings, Determinations and Bulletins. Exceptions to the usual rules and complaints 28. These policies and guidelines are to be followed by those representing the Commissioner in litigation at all times. However, where following these policies and guidelines produce an anomalous or unintended result (and it is expected that such occasions will be rare), approval must be sought from the relevant LSB Stream Leader or a member of the LSB Executive. 29. Complaints, other than those related to the Attorney General's Legal Services Directions referred to at paragraphs 19 to 21, received from taxpayers or their representatives that our conduct in litigation has fallen short of acceptable standards, should be considered by a senior officer, usually the relevant LSB Stream Leader or a member of the LSB Executive. Litigation in the Tax Office 30. LSB has corporate responsibility for legal services in the Tax Office. Access to any legal services must go through LSB. As LSB is the central point of reference in respect of all legal work where the Tax Office is using external legal providers (other than prosecutions work), all requests seeking the services of external legal providers must go to LSB. Working as a team 31. Litigation is handled by several people working together as a team. The team may vary from time to time, but an LSB officer and a business line officer will always be a part of each team. Depending on the case, the litigation team might also include a Tax Counsel Network officer, a business line officer, an officer from the relevant Centre of Expertise (CoE), and an external legal service provider. Presently, the range of external legal service providers available to the Tax Office consists of the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS), legal service providers on any Tax Office panel (such as the Debt Litigation panel, General Law panel and Tax Technical Litigation and Tax Legal Advice panel), and counsel. http://law.ato.gov.au/atokw/print.htni7DocIDsPSR%2FPS200712%2FNAT%2FATO... 18/07/2008 PS LA 2007/12 - Conduct of Tax Office Litigation in Courts and TribunalsPage 8 of 16 32. The following is a general outline of the individual roles of each member of the litigation team. It is meant to provide guidelines rather than be prescriptive. The team must work collaboratively to ensure that the litigation team works together to achieve the best possible outcome. The role of LSB in tax litigation 33. 'Tax litigation' includes all litigation undertaken under Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (TAA), declaratory proceedings brought in any court that will directly affect the taxation liability of a taxpayer, and judicial review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 or section 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 in relation to any decision made under the Income Tax Assessment Acts, or the TAA. It does not include, for example, employment related litigation or commercial litigation. 34. LSB manages the Tax Office's litigation program. It provides legal and strategic advice through in- house teams of LSB officers. It manages access to external legal service providers, and is primarily responsible for managing legal risks to the Commissioner. 35. LSB is responsible for all appearance work and related advice on legal process and risks, all matters under Part IVC of the TAA, debt matters requiring legal representation, administrative law matters, employment law, commercial law, compensation, other related legal advice and appearance work (except prosecutions), and managing the Test Case Litigation Program. 36. LSB is the central point of reference for all legal work undertaken for the Tax Office by external legal providers. LSB is the conduit for the exchange of any information between the Tax Office and the external legal service provider. LSB provides a single point of contact so that conflicting Tax Office messages are not given. 37. LSB is the central liaison point for the litigation team. Contact with the external legal service provider other than through LSB should be avoided as much as possible. If contact without LSB is unavoidable then the LSB officer and other litigation team members are to be informed and provided with copies of all relevant documents without delay. 38. The LSB officer must ensure that where Tax Counsel is involved, that Tax Counsel is kept fully informed of ail important actions arising in the course of litigation. Tax Counsel will be involved where the matter is a strategic litigation matter, or if the matter relates to an existing priority technical issue.9 39. The LSB officer will ensure that Tax Counsel is informed of the specific technical issues arising during the course of litigation and provide ample opportunity for Tax Counsel to comment on the technical arguments in the case. Tax Counsel will be the final decision maker on the technical arguments to be run. 40. Where Tax Counsel is not involved in litigation, LSB will be the final decision maker on all issues arising in the course of the litigation, including the technical argument and issues relating to the conduct of the litigation, such as the litigation strategy or issues concerning Court or Tribunal processes. Although the business line officer will be consulted, the decision will ultimately rest with LSB. If members of the litigation team cannot resolve an issue, it must be escalated to the relevant Senior Tax Counsel (Strategic Litigation) 10 or an Assistant Commissioner, Litigation. Depending on the significance of the issue, it may need to be escalated to the Chief Tax Counsel or the Deputy Chief Tax Counsel. 41. Generally, the LSB officer will: • provide legal and litigation support • provide advice on the admissibility and the extent of the factual evidence available to support the Tax Office view • identify any technical or procedural issues that require further discussion and development by or with Tax Counsel • ensure that any matters requiring the advice of.Tax Counsel are supported with sufficient information and documentation to enable an informed decision to be made http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/print.htm?DocID=PSR%2FPS200712%2FNAT%2FATO... 18/07/2008 Page 9 of 16PS LA 2007/12 - Conduct of Tax Office Litigation in Courts and Tribunals • ensure that Tax Counsel is invited to any conference with counsel that is directed towards technical arguments or important directions of the case • provide assistance to Tax Counsel on the refinement and presentation of the Tax Office view • ensure that Tax Office policies and procedures are followed, for example that we do not argue inconsistently with views expressed in public rulings or taxation determinations, and • ensure that the Tax Office operates as a model litigant. 42. During the conduct of a matter, there will be mutual feedback on any performance or resource issues that arise, and issues should be escalated appropriately. Strategic litigation 43. The strategic litigation program represents those cases regarded by the Tax Office as being of the greatest importance in terms of law clarification. There are three Senior Tax Counsel providing leadership in strategic litigation, two with responsibility for income tax issues and one with responsibility for indirect tax issues. Strategic litigation may arise from any of the streams in the LSB. The relevant Senior Tax Counsel may either directly undertake the conduct of, or closely monitor, strategic litigation cases, with or without other Tax Counsel involvement. 44. Issues identified for strategic litigation will ordinarily be identified through various risk management actions (see PS LA 2007/16 Risk Management in litigation) or through the Priority Technical Issue process (see PS LA 2005/22 Litigation and priority technical issues). The escalation processes set out in the practice statements will ensure that strategic litigation is referred to one of the relevant Senior Tax Counsel (Strategic Litigation). The Senior Tax Counsel (Strategic Litigation) will be required to report to PTIC on the progress of strategic litigation. Relationship management is a key aspect of strategic litigation. 45. A Strategic Litigation team located in LSB provides support to the Senior Tax Counsel (Strategic Litigation) to ensure that the highest priority litigation is identified, reported and managed corporately. The primary responsibility of the relevant Senior Tax Counsel (Strategic Litigation) is technical leadership and management of strategic litigation. The role of LSB in non-tax litigation Debt 46. The Debt Stream within LSB is responsible for litigation relating to the Tax Office collection of tax revenue and insolvency matters, under the laws administered by the Commissioner or other relevant legislation such as the Corporations Act 2001 and the Bankruptcy Act 1966. This includes representing the Commissioner in Court, briefing counsel, and negotiating and settling matters such as company wind ups (and substitutions), creditors petitions, defended debt matters, and voidable preference claims. Commercial law 47. The ATO General Counsel in LSB is responsible for the provision of expert advice and litigation services in respect of commercial law issues affecting the Tax Office. The commercial law group within LSB deals with issues arising out of contracts (for Information Technology services and goods procurements), tendering and procurement processes and associated administrative law issues, intellectual property rights and real property. The group also provides advice on procurement related corporate management practice statements and other corporate guidelines. 48. External legal advice on commercial law issues must be obtained through the commercial law team. The commercial law team leader is the LSB relationship manager between LSB and Corporate Procurement and Facilities (including Comcover). Employment law http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/print.htm?DocID=PSR%2FPS200712%2FNAT%2FATO... 18/07/2008 Page 10 of 16PS LA 2007/12 - Conduct of Tax Office Litigation in Courts and Tribunals 49. The employment law group deals with issues arising form the Tax Office's relationship with its employees. These issues include litigation relating to termination of employment, industrial disputes and litigation arising from discrimination claims against the Tax Office. Litigation is usually conducted in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC), Federal Court, Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and other courts of appeal. The employment law group also provides advice on all aspects of employment, industrial and discrimination law issues as they affect the Tax Office. The role of tax counsel in litigation 50. Tax Counsel Network (TCN) is a national network of highly skilled tax technical officers. The role of TCN is to provide technical leadership for the Tax Office. TCN works with the business lines and CoE (where appropriate) to resolve the Tax Office's key significant issues. The responsibility for formulating the ATO view on these significant issues rests with TCN. This can involve TCN working on strategic litigation, especially where the Tax Office view on a priority technical issue (PTI) is under challenge. 51. Once a litigation matter has been risk assessed and it is decided that it warrants being a PTI (or is related to an existing PTI), Tax Counsel will have the final say as to the Tax Office view and the preparation of arguments. Usually, once a Tax Counsel becomes involved, they will have an on-going role throughout the litigation process. The level of involvement of Tax Counsel may vary from case to case and from milestone to milestone (for example when the Appeal Statement is being drafted, or when submissions are being settled). This will ultimately be at the discretion of Tax Counsel, who should work collaboratively with other members of the team, and ensure that the skills and expertise of the other members are fully utilised. 52. Tax Counsel has an important role in strategic litigation matters. They will ensure that: • the coherent fabric of the law is maintained and an interpretation of the law will not be pursued where it is not consistent with this principle, and • cases are prepared and presented in a way that best enables the Tax Office view to be presented to court. 53. Tax Counsel will have the final say in technical arguments arising in litigation. Tax Counsel will also contribute to the management of the wider risk associated with the PTI. 54. Written instructions to external counsel should always be signed off by Tax Counsel, especially where: • the instruction is to make arguments not previously contemplated by the Tax Office • action is being taken that is contrary to the advice of counsel, or • there is disagreement between senior officers of the Tax Office regarding the arguments or the strategy put before counsel. Any such directions provided by Tax Counsel to the LSB officer should be forwarded immediately to the external legal service provider (where they are involved) for the instruction of counsel. 55. Tax Counsel will consult with the CoE on the level of assistance required from the CoE in the conduct of the litigation, having regard to the assistance already available from the business line, LSB and the external solicitor. The role of the Chief Tax Counsel and Deputy Chief Tax Counsels in litigation 56. The Chief Tax Counsel, the various Deputy Chief Tax Counsels, and ultimately the Second Commissioner (Law) have the final say in all tax technical issues argued in litigation. Special Leave applications to appeal to the High Court will be decided by the Chief Tax Counsel. The decision whether or not to appeal an adverse decision will usually be made by the relevant Deputy Chief Tax Counsel or if necessary, the Second Commissioner (Law) on the recommendation of one of the relevant Senior Tax Counsel (Strategic Litigation), Tax Counsel allocated to cases act on the authority of the Deputy Chief Tax Counsels. http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/print.htm7DocIDsPSR%2FPS200712%2FNAT%2FATO... 18/07/2008 PS DA 2UU//I2 - Conduct of Tax Office Litigation in Courts and TribunalsPage 11 of 16 The role of the business lines in litigation 57. Generally, throughout the litigation process, the business line will be responsible for managing the risk associated with the case and dependent cases. 58. The business line has the responsibility of providing a complete and comprehensive statement of facts which cross-references to supporting evidence. This will assist LSB, Tax Counsel or the CoE to ensure that the Tax Office view has been correctly applied. 59. Tax Counsel or LSB are responsible for determining the Tax Office view. It is not determined by the business line. 60. The business line has a continuous role throughout the course of litigation. Where the business line has collected the facts at the audit and objection stage, it will have an expertise in the knowledge of the location of documents and the underlying facts. The business line will support the litigation process with that knowledge. The business line is responsible for issuing assessments and amended assessments, and will harness the corporate expertise to ensure the accuracy of assessments issued before and after the litigation process has commenced. 61. The business line will have an integral role in identifying whether or not an issue arising from litigation is a PTI. The business line will make an assessment of the risks posed to the Commissioner which arise from the litigation. This necessarily requires an understanding of not only the 'legal' or 'technical' issue but also of the business context in which it arises, its impact in terms of numbers of taxpayers affected, the revenue at risk and the implications for government and the community as a whole. The business line is responsible for managing this risk. 62. At the commencement of the litigation process, the business line must assess (or review) the risk in relation to the litigation and the underlying technical issue (with input from LSB in relation to the legal risks which could arise). If it is determined that the case and/or underlying issue warrants a PTI, the business line must prepare a PTI proposal and escalate it in accordance with its normal PTI procedures to the relevant Deputy Chief Tax Counsel. 63. If the business line requires assistance to decide whether the underlying technical issue of a case should be classified as a PTI, the business line can ask the relevant Deputy Chief Tax Counsel to have Tax Counsel allocated to assist in determining whether or not a PTI is warranted. 64. The business line (with the assistance of other members of the litigation team where required) will be responsible for developing a strategy to explain and manage the implications of the Court decision, and the associated compliance impact. See PS LA 2007/2 for details on the corporate approach to dealing with the risks to the Commissioner arising from Court and Tribunal decisions.11 The role of external solicitors in litigation 65. Legal services may be provided by external solicitors on the relevant Tax Office panel in the conduct of litigation to which the Commissioner is a party. Solicitors acting for the Commissioner are expected to assist the Commissioner in the conduct of litigation to achieve a timely and appropriate resolution of the particular dispute. This may result in law clarification which provides greater certainty for the community about the law. A solicitor acting for the Commissioner will provide legal services in the conduct of litigation consistent with the professional and ethical standards expected of a solicitor practising in the relevant State or Territory. 66. As the solicitor will have direct dealings with taxpayers or their representatives it is expected that the solicitor will also conduct him or herself consistently with the standards of conduct expected of a tax officer. In particular the solicitor must: • comply with the Legal Services Directions made by the Attorney-General for the conduct of litigation by Commonwealth Departments and Agencies • if the solicitor becomes aware of, or suspects, a breach of the Attorney-General's Legal Services Directions, notify the LSB officer immediately of that breach or suspected breach and advise on any possible actions that would minimise the http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/print.htm7DocffifcPSR%2FPS200712%2FNAT%2FATO... 18/07/2008 PS LA 2007/12 - Conduct of Tax Office Litigation in Courts and TribunalsPage 12 of 16 impact of that breach • comply with the tax law secrecy provisions, and • • avoid conflicts of interest and where one arises, advise the Tax Office immediately. 67. The solicitor will provide general legal services, including advice on the selection of external counsel, drafting and filing Court and Tribunal documents, advise on the adequacy and admissibility of evidence, advise on court requirements and procedures, and undertake advocacy where appropriate. 68. The solicitor needs to clearly understand the requirements of the Commissioner in the conduct of the case, and to relay those requirements to counsel. Thus, it is vital that clear and specific instructions are provided from the LSB officer to the solicitor. In turn, the solicitor is expected to advise the Tax Office of views provided by counsel on the case and any developments in the court timetable. 69. There is a category of legal work which cannot be undertaken by any other externallegal service provider but tied legal services providers.12 This relates to 'tied work' which must be briefed directly to AGS outside of its membership of any panel of external legal service providers. Tied work' as defined by the Legal Services Directions comprises areas of government legal work relating to: Category Tied provider Constitutional issues AGS National security issues AGS Legal advice to be considered by Cabinet or relied on in preparing a Cabinet submission or memorandum AGS Legal advice on a legislative proposal to be considered for adoption by government or on draft legislation for introduction into Parliament AGS Public international law work (a) International litigation and arbitration (Government to Government) (b) Advice involving Australia's or another country's obligations under international law (c) Advice on treaty implementation (d) Advice on implementing a treaty (including bilateral agreements) (e) Domestic litigation involving a significant public international law issue (a) AGS, AGD13, DFAT14 (b) AGS, AGD, DFAT (c) AGS, AGD, DFAT (d) AGS, AGD, DFAT (e) AGS, AGD Drafting work http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/print.htm?DocID=PSR%2FPS200712%2FNAT%2FATO... 18/07/2008 PS LA 2007/12 - Conduct of Tax Office Litigation in Courts and Tribunals Page 13 of 16 Drafting government (a) Office of Bills and Parliamentary parliamentary amendments of Bills Counsel (b) Office of Drafting ofLegislative regulations,Drafting and ordinances andPublishing in regulations of non- the Attorney- self-governingGeneral's territories and other legislative instruments made or approved by the Governor-General, or published in the Statutory Rules series Department The role of the Strategic Internal Litigation Committee 70. A Strategic Internal Litigation Committee (SILC) is to be convened for every litigation matter, and meetings should be convened at all critical stages of litigation. Each SILC meeting has a particular purpose in managing the litigation matter to ensure that the litigation strategy is appropriate and in place: • Document Preparation SILC • Instruction SILC • Pre-hearing SILC • Post-hearing SILC • Pre-decision SILC • Decision SILC • Post-decision SILC • Appeal SILC15 However, it is recognised that due to the timeframes set by the Courts or Tribunals in particular cases, it is not always possible to convene every SILC for each litigation matter. Good judgment and consultation between the litigation team members is required to ensure continual good management of the case and that key decisions are made collaboratively. The actual SILC can vary depending on the significance of the matter, but will always include an LSB officer and a business line officer. Depending on the particular case, it may also include Tax Counsel and Centre of Expertise officers. SILC Plan 71. Every litigation matter must have a SILC Plan. A SILC Plan is a document setting out the details and status of a litigation matter, including the litigation strategy and any milestones. The Plan includes amongst other things, a summary of the issues, the Tax Office view and the significance of the matter. The BSL officer is to initially prepare the SILC Plan and provide the document electronically to the LSB officer. 72. The SILC Plan is to be updated by the LSB officer throughout the litigation process, particularly after each SILC meeting. Updated versions of the SILC Plan must be provided to all internal members of the litigation team. http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/print.htm7DocIIIfcPSR%2FPS200712%2FNAT%2FATO... 18/07/2008 PS LA 2007/12 - Conduct of Tax Office Litigation in Courts and Tribunals Page 14 of 16 Governance - litigation 73. A corporate level committee (the Priority Technical Issues Committee) chaired by the Chief Tax Counsel provides guidance and direction, and monitors the management of PTIs within the established corporate framework. Litigation forms a part of that framework. LSB also reports to the Law Sub-plan Executive across all litigation work types, including volume trends, resource costs and the amount of revenue at risk. Strategic litigation reports, involving PTI litigation are provided to the Priority Technical Issues Committee. 74. Monthly reports on significant litigation matters are provided to senior management, including the ATO Executive. 75. LSB officers provide monthly assurances on their conduct in litigation on matters including whether the Legal Services Directions have been complied with and whether court time-frames have been met. These monthly assurances are used in the corporate assurance process provided to the Commissioner in the form of a twice yearly Certificate of Assurance.

Inland Revenue is seeking feedback on proposed administrative and legislative changes to the tax disputes process, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne and Inland Revenue Commissioner Robert Russell jointly announced today.

In launching an issues paper and revised standard practice statements with Mr Russell, the Minister said that every year a number of cases end up in dispute.

"The Government expects the tax system to resolve these disputes swiftly and efficiently. A regular review of the resolution mechanism is therefore necessary," Mr Dunne said.

The paper and revised standard practice statements come in response to a submission from the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA) and the New Zealand Law Society. The submission focused on aspects of the formal disputes process such as the quality and timeframe for producing documentation and the right of taxpayers to opt out of the process.

Mr Dunne said the solutions proposed were largely administrative rather than legislative changes.

"Apart from some minor remedial work which was required, the legislation surrounding the disputes process appears to be adequate. The objective therefore is to ensure the process works more efficiently for everyone."

Mr Russell said that Inland Revenue was also seeking feedback on revised standard practice statements related to the disputes process.

"Some of the changes outlined in the revised practices, such as independently facilitated conferences and streamlined documents, are already in place and working well," he said.

"The new practice statements simply endorse these as best practice guidelines. We believe they will greatly facilitate a swifter and more accessible dispute resolution process and will address many of the concerns raised by NZICA and the NZ Law Society," Mr Russell said.

Consultation on the proposed changes to the disputes process and the revised standard practice statements will be open until 20 August 2010. The documents can be found at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/

### Address at Official Opening of New Zealand Institute of chartered Accountants’ (NZICA) Auckland Branch

_Parnell, Auckland, 3.45pm, Friday, 23 July 2010_

Good afternoon. It is great to be here on this auspicious occasion - so thank you very much for inviting me to be part of it.

I want to acknowledge the kaumatua, the tangata whenua, the special guests and life members of the Institute who are here today.

I also want to place on record my appreciation, and that of my ministerial colleagues, to NZICA, and the Auckland branch in particular, for the significant contribution you make in so many areas of our country's economic activity.

I especially value the warm association and dialogue I have had with your Institute on taxation issues over many, many years, and I look forward to that continuing in the future.

Today you are looking forward expectantly to a new home for your Auckland branch and a new future for the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants.

At the same time, New Zealand as a whole is contemplating a new economic future as we move out of recession.

I would like to take this opportunity to give you a quick update on how current tax policy work is progressing and what the Government is doing to build better economic prospects and social outcomes for New Zealand.

A large part of the work programme will, of necessity, focus on this year's Budget initiatives.

The Budget introduced a number of significant changes to our tax system including lower tax rates for individuals, businesses and savers, a rise in the GST rate, and changes to the investment property rules.

In addition to the measures in the bill, the Budget announced changes to reform the rules around loss attributing qualifying companies.

An important change, of course, was the alignment of the top personal tax rate with the trust tax rate at 33% to provide a greater incentive for saving and investment.

Aligning the company tax rate and the rate for savings vehicles, such as PIEs, will promote saving.

It also significantly improves the integrity and fairness of the tax system by removing the main tax advantage that could be gained by sheltering income in trusts.

As you know, the company tax rate and that applying to certain savings vehicles will drop to 28 cents in the dollar.

The company tax rate reduction is good news for business as it will make New Zealand a more competitive investment destination.

As a result of these far-reaching changes, we are reviewing the current tax policy work programme that was released in March last year and was revised last September.

The review is requiring hard choices to be made on what measures we can and should proceed with, given the Budget priorities and current resource and fiscal restraints.

The work programme is still under consideration by Ministers, but I am happy to talk to you about some of the more significant pieces of work that will be undertaken in the coming year.

We sought public comment earlier this year on how qualifying companies could be moved to a flow-through treatment for income tax purposes.

The Government's intention was to address a number of problems with the current loss attributing qualifying company rules which can undermine the integrity of the tax system.

The proposal was that the current qualifying company rules for closely held companies would be replaced with a new set of rules to treat qualifying companies as flow-through entities for income tax purposes, similar to limited partnerships.

A consequence of this would be that a company's income and losses would both be passed on to shareholders, so income would be taxed and losses deducted at a shareholder's marginal tax rate.

The Government is currently considering submissions made in respect of these proposals and will announce its decisions in this area shortly.

Inland Revenue also began public consultation on proposals to remove complexity from the tax system by reducing the use of paper forms in administering the tax system and increasing online services and technology.

As you know, we are also looking at reforming the PAYE and personal tax summary process (including the possible option of making PAYE a final tax for many) and introducing a new framework for sharing appropriate information with the necessary safeguards with other government agencies.

Under such an approach, to help reduce administrative and compliance costs, Inland Revenue would move to a greater emphasis on electronic interaction with taxpayers.

Businesses, employers and the non-profit sector would have software which takes care of routine PAYE compliance tasks, such as the need to separately file an employer monthly schedule by automatically communicating with Inland Revenue.

The software could have an option of providing information to Inland Revenue on a payday basis.

All these measures are aimed at promoting growth and building a tax system that is fair.

We also need to remove inequalities and protect the integrity of the system.

In this regard, let me say a word or two about the work of the Rewrite Advisory Panel.

As you are probably aware, the Rewrite Advisory Panel was established in 1995 to consider and advise on unintended changes in the law arising from the rewriting of the Income Tax Acts.

It has done this job exceptionally well.

Although rewrite issues continue to be the core role of the Panel's work, I see its role moving progressively to take on remedial issues.

This is why I announced earlier this year that the Panel would begin turning its attention to remedial items not arising from the Rewrite Project - to cover matters that are raised by tax practitioners or Inland Revenue with a view to remedial amendments to any of the Inland Revenue Acts.

This is a natural progression from the Panel's original purpose of addressing unintended legislative change to ensure ease of understanding, simplicity and administration of our tax law.

These same principles continue to apply as the Panel's focus turns to also include remedial items.

I am looking for a quick, efficient and useful process for dealing with remedial matters and I have already approached some key groups including NZICA seeking their input into what the priorities should be.

Because the scope of the proposal is potentially quite large, I have indicated that only issues on particular topics will be called for publicly - at least initially.

My expectation is also that any remedial issues would not relate to matters on the tax policy work programme.

Today, I am pleased to announce the first call for remedial items.

The areas that we seek your input are:

*   Available Subscribed Capital (ASC) on corporate reorganisation; and
*   beneficiary income of trusts.

These areas that relate to the capital of companies being reorganised and the treatment of income received by beneficiaries of trusts are important to the efficient functioning of the tax system.

Your submissions to the Panel on remedial items in these areas will help improve the tax system by making necessary running repairs and maintenance.

I encourage you to send submissions to the Rewrite Advisory Panel by 3 September.

On the work programme side you are probably aware of some of the higher profile subjects.

In October when GST rises to 15%, I am confident we will have done everything we can to ensure that the transition is seamless.

To a large part, this is due to the good work of the GST Advisory Panel, which I established under the chairmanship of Frank Owen after the Budget.

The Panel has taken a very activist approach to its task, and has already identified a number of issues arising for businesses as a result of the rate change that will require transitional amendments to the legislation.

Following discussion with the Minister of Finance, I will be recommending to the Cabinet changes to grandparent at the 12.5% rate health insurance contracts, general insurance contracts and finance leases that straddle the 1 October date for the rate change, subject to certain criteria.

I will also be recommending some more minor changes that will ensure that certain contracts which have either been fully invoiced and performed or, in some situations, fully paid but not fully performed remain at the 12.5% rate.

A further legislative measure relates to lay-by sales for which the 12.5% rate will apply to payments made before 1 October.

In all these cases legislative change will either address unmanageable compliance costs for affected businesses or provide much needed certainty.

I have asked officials in conjunction with the Advisory Panel to undertake limited consultation on the legislation once this is available to ensure that these objectives are met.

The changes the Panel has proposed to date have not yet been formally considered by the Cabinet, but as they are largely technical, I am very optimistic they will be supported.

The Panel is in place until the end of the year, and I would expect it to draw other matters of concern to our attention as and when they arise.

Another item out for consultation is the proposed changes to the disputes process which was in response to your joint submission with the New Zealand Law Society.

The proposed changes are largely administrative with some supporting legislative changes also required.

It benefits neither government nor taxpayers to have disputes rules that are fraught with arguments about the process rather than substantive ones.

So I urge you to go to the Inland Revenue's policy website, read the proposals and make a submission - consultation closes on 20 August.

International tax agreement work is progressing well and double tax agreements already negotiated are proving very beneficial for cross-border trade.

The current emphasis is on negotiating updates to our tax treaties with key trading and investment partners with a view to securing similar withholding tax rates on cross-border dividend and royalty payments to those secured in 2008 with the United States and in 2009 with Australia.

Negotiations are now under way with the United Kingdom and Canada, with more to follow.

In addition, a new tax treaty with Turkey was signed in April this year, and negotiations for a treaty with Hong Kong will begin in October.

The Taxation (Income-sharing Tax Credit) Bill, which arises from the National/UnitedFuture confidence and supply agreement, will allow a new tax credit for couples with dependent children.

It has now been finalised and will be introduced to the House shortly.

It is based on the idea that couples with dependent children share their incomes equally and pay tax based on half of the shared income.

The tax credit, proposed to take effect from 1 April 2012, will provide additional financial support for couples where one partner is on a higher tax rate than the other partner.

The tax credit will also ensure that different couples on the same level of combined income effectively pay the same combined amount of personal income tax, regardless of how much each partner earns.

The income-sharing tax credit is similar to the Working for Families tax credit and would share many of the same rules and requirements to help keep administration and compliance costs down.

Beyond matters such as these, we are making some serious choices.

As always, I appreciate any input you may offer in line with the good working relationship we enjoy with you.

Thank you very much and I now declare this building open.

My very best wishes for the future.

Media Statement

### Dunne: Income Sharing could benefit up to 310,000 families

Up to 310,000 New Zealand families will be eligible to share their income for tax purposes through legislation tabled in Parliament today by Revenue Minister Peter Dunne under the Confidence and Supply Agreement with the National-led Government.

"This bill will give couples with children the option of having a parent work fewer or more flexible hours, be at home raising their children, and able to increase their combined after-tax income," Mr Dunne said.

"We constantly hear the term 'family-friendly' bandied about, but this bill will actually put money in the pockets of many families who choose to have a parent more actively involved in raising their children.

"It will empower and help families who see it as important to bring their children up that way, and that is a lot of New Zealand families," he said.

Income Sharing is a key part of UnitedFuture's tax policy and formed part of its Confidence and Supply agreement with the National-led Government.

"I am very proud of this Bill both as Revenue Minister and as leader of UnitedFuture - it is a key policy plank for us," Mr Dunne said.

"Couples who decide to have one parent at home looking after the children have to make a financial sacrifice to do that. It is a decision that really costs them, and we want to do something to ease that cost and recognise the importance of the choice they are making in a practical way," he said.

Under the _Taxation (Income-sharing Tax Credit) Bill_, couples with dependent children will be able to choose to be taxed on an equal share of their combined income and apply for a tax credit at the end of the tax year.

The bill proposes that each partner in a relationship caring for children under 18 be taxed on an equal share of their combined income. At the end of the tax year they would be able to apply to Inland Revenue for a tax credit based on the difference between the tax they would have paid on an individual basis and what they would pay based on half of their combined income.

"Because income tax rates rise according to the amount earned, many families could ultimately end up paying less tax if, for example, one parent works fulltime and the other chooses to remain home to care for their children," Mr Dunne said.

Parents would have to be spouses, civil union partners or de facto partners, and New Zealand tax residents for the whole tax year before they could claim a tax credit. One of the partners would also have to be the principal caregiver for the dependent child or children.

The tax credit would also be available to parents who have separated if they have entered a new relationship and are sharing responsibility for caring for their child for at least a third of the tax year, Mr Dunne said.

"This will benefit many couples with children, but it will depend on their personal income situation as a couple, and obviously it would not apply to sole parents who have no one to income share with, and have other mechanisms in place to support them," he said.

Mr Dunne said he was fully aware that some might view this aspect of income sharing as being contrary to the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act.

"The obvious point is that there is no single benefit that can fit every individual's circumstances. That is why we have targeted assistance for groups with particular social and financial needs, and sole parents who have an important job to do, have other support mechanisms available to them.

"Income Sharing is one that benefits two-parent families," he said. "Single parents, for example, have access to the childcare subsidy, the minimum family tax credit, the childcare rebate and the domestic purposes benefit," he said.

"Income Sharing recognises the financial choices many couples with children often have to make about whether they both work full-time and employ others to care for their children or whether one partner stays home to care for the children, possibly on a part-time basis.

"In this way income sharing would give parents greater choice about their work and caring roles," he said.

The credit would be optional so couples who wanted to claim it would have to apply to Inland Revenue, Mr Dunne said. If the bill passed through all stages, the credit would start from the tax year beginning 1 April 2012, he said.

### Income Sharing - Questions and Answers

**What is Income Sharing?**

It is when a couple combine their individual incomes and pay tax as if they had earned half each. The income sharing is only for the purpose of this new tax credit, it will not affect PAYE, student loans, or child support.

**How many families could potentially benefit from Income Sharing?**

Up to 310,000 families are expected to be eligible to benefit from Income Sharing. Of this number, some families may choose not to apply for the credit, depending on how much they would benefit from it.. This number of families is determined on the basis of couples with a dependent child under 18.

**Does the couple have to be caring for a child?**

Yes, the tax credit is targeted to couples that are caring for a dependent child. It will not be available for couples without children, or where their children are over 17 years old and have left school (similar to Working for Families tax credit).

**When will the income sharing tax credit be available?**

If the legislation becomes law next year, it would be in effect for the 2012/13 tax year with tax credits paid after 31 March 2013.

**What consultation has happened?**

A government discussion document was published in 2008 seeking people's views on possible income sharing for families. The details of an income sharing proposal were considered in an issues paper in 2009. Most submissions supported the proposal.

**What is the most someone could get?**

The maximum that a couple could get from the tax credit is $9,080 (based on the tax rates and thresholds that will apply from 1 October 2010). This would be a single income household earning $140,000 or more.

**How much will the new income sharing tax credit cost?**

Depending on take-up, it could cost around $450 million a year.

**Will anyone be worse off?**

The tax credit will be voluntary, so if a couple do not believe they would be better off, they do not need to apply. One partner in a couple receiving the Income Sharing tax credit would not be able to receive the independent earner tax credit.

**What about sole parents? Or couples that separated during the year?**

They would not qualify for the Income Sharing tax credit. The tax credit is based on a couple sharing their income for the whole of the tax year and is targeted at those caring for dependent children. There may be other assistance available to groups who do not qualify for the income sharing tax credit (e.g. independent earner tax credit, domestic purposes benefit etc). It is not possible to design an income sharing tax credit that helps everyone.

**Examples**

A qualifying family with one income of $60,000 would be eligible for an income sharing tax credit of $2,480.

A qualifying family where one partner earns $80,000 and the other partner earns $40,000 would be eligible for an income sharing tax credit of $1,300.

A qualifying family where one partner earns $80,000 and the other partner earns $10,000 would be eligible for an income sharing tax credit of $4,580.

### Dunne: consultation to make child support scheme fairer

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today launched a discussion document proposing a series of options - including changing how child support is calculated - to make the scheme fairer.

Mr Dunne said he wants New Zealanders' views on a number of options to improve a child support scheme that "is outdated and sometimes unfair".

"The reality is that family life in New Zealand has changed considerably in the 18 years since the current scheme was introduced," Mr Dunne said in releasing the Supporting Children discussion document.

"Families have evolved and their domestic and financial situations have changed, and are often more complex today than they were in the past.

"Today both parents are far more likely to be working than was the case in 1992, and often separated fathers have a far greater involvement with their children than they used to have," he said.

"We need a child support scheme that works better and we need New Zealanders - particularly those whose lives are impacted by it - to contribute to a national discussion on this very important issue," he said.

However, Mr Dunne said his first message to New Zealanders was simple: "While we need a scheme that serves children better and is fair to parents, we do not want people in this system if it can be avoided.

"It is better if parents can come to their own arrangements for the benefit of their children when their relationship breaks down. Child support is a backstop when you cannot do that.

"It should be the last choice, not the first," he said.

Currently, the scheme arranges financial support for the care of 210,000 children.

Mr Dunne said Supporting Children outlined a range of options for improving the scheme.

These include changing the formula that determines the amount of child support payable to take into account factors such as the cost of raising children today, the degree of shared care between parents who are living apart, and the income of both parents.

"An important part of getting the scheme right will be creating a situation where paying parents are more likely to comply with their obligations voluntarily.

"They are more likely to do that if they see their obligations as fair, transparent and reasonable - and not based upon some formula that seems to have no regard for their individual circumstances.

"The options in the discussion document also seek to get a balance between the welfare of the parent who receives child support and the obligations of the parent who pays it," Mr Dunne said.

"In keeping with the need for this balance, the document asks whether child support payments should be automatically deducted from employees' income, and whether the penalty and write-off rules for child support need to be amended to provide better and more effective incentives to pay.

"I urge all interested parties to have a say on the options in the discussion document. They can do that either in writing or by taking part in an online consultation which gives a brief description of the issues and seeks participants' views on them.

"These contributions will have a big influence on ensuring that we have a child support scheme that works as effectively as possible, for the well being of our children," Mr Dunne said.

The discussion document Supporting Children is available at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz. The online consultation is available at  www-supportingchildren.ird.govt.nz \[site no longer available - see [Internet Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20100905174540/http://www.supportingchildren.ird.govt.nz/)\

SPEECH

Opening Address at Eriksen Conference 2010  
'Investment and Superannuation Issues in Tough and Uncertain Times'  
Auckland  
Tuesday, 14 September 2010

Good morning and thank you for inviting me here to address this conference.

It is a pleasure to be able to address you today on a subject in which I, as Minister of Revenue, have a huge interest.

Your conference is focused on investment and savings which are at the heart of the Government's economic agenda.

The overall emphasis of our policies is on promoting greater productivity and accumulation of capital so New Zealanders, including those who are retiring, can enjoy a secure and prosperous future.

You have particularly asked me to comment on KiwiSaver; issues with the scheme and potential improvements we could make.

In addressing KiwiSaver, it is important to place it in the wider context of the Government's approach to savings and investment, how tax fits into that, New Zealand Superannuation and the issues being considered by the newly launched Savings Working Group.

### Savings and investment in New Zealand

The reality is that our recent savings and investment track record has not been great - we have spent more than we have earned, and when we, as individuals, have invested, we have tended to invest in property.

As you would be aware, the Government is concerned by these trends and has taken steps to address them.

The 2010 Budget contained substantive tax measures that improve the incentives for efficient savings and investment.

The Government has also established a framework designed to further improve national investment, and has recently formed the Savings Working Group to explore ways to improve our savings performance.

This framework is designed to provide a solid basis for sustained and productive growth in the economy over the long-term.

As people interested in the health of the retirement system, you will well appreciate the need to think about the long-run impact of policies.

The simple reality is that there are no quick fixes here.

However, our retirement savings situation is not all bleak.

Certainly it has improved markedly since the advent of KiwiSaver.

You may remember that the tax rules on savings that previously applied operated very unevenly.

Managed funds were taxed at a flat 33% thereby overtaxing lower income investors on a 19.5% tax rate.

This created a significant tax disincentive for lower income earners to save.

In addition, investment in some countries was favoured over investment in others.

New tax rules for savings came into force during 2007.

These rules consist of the new portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules for managed funds and the fair dividend rate (FDR) rules for offshore portfolio share investments.

The new rules addressed the long standing problems with the taxation of managed funds.

In particular, they have created a much more level playing field between those who invest through managed funds and those that invest directly.

The new rules also address the problem of investors in managed funds having their investment income taxed at a higher rate than their marginal tax rate.

Under the new rules, lower income savers investing in entities that elect to become PIEs are taxed at their correct tax rate - 12.5% or 21%.

The tax rate on investment income of higher income savers in PIEs is currently capped at 30%.

This will drop to 28% on 1 October.

These changes were deliberately made to ensure the viability of KiwiSaver as a government-subsidised private sector retirement savings scheme.

Removing the previous tax disadvantages of saving through managed funds was very important to achieve the purpose of encouraging people to save through KiwiSaver.

The arrival of KiwiSaver has changed the landscape of retirement savings and managed funds for the better.

### KiwiSaver

Its success has exceeded government expectations.

Late last month, membership reached 1.5 million - a third higher than a year earlier.

Interest has been so strong that at the end of its first year, there were a net 716,000 enrolments.

The original forecast for that period was for 276,000.

KiwiSaver has proved to be very attractive to New Zealanders.

It is clear that KiwiSaver has been a very successful policy.

Three years after its introduction, enrolment growth continues to be strong.

The fact is that New Zealanders continue to enrol at a rate of about 30,000 per month, and this has essentially been maintained over the last two years - putting the lie to political criticism that the Government's changes to KiwiSaver in 2009 "gutted" the scheme.

So why am I telling you this?

These statistics bear out my view that there are no real issues with KiwiSaver.

And at a time when fiscal prudence is called for, I cannot justify putting further incentives into the scheme when plainly it is working absolutely fine as it is.

I am always ready to hear suggestions, but the old adage, 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' certainly comes to mind here.

Having said that, though, I make the point that KiwiSaver is a major government programme, and any such programme can always benefit from improvements in the way it is delivered.

We continue to refine the administration and legislation for KiwiSaver to improve certainty and efficiency for savers and providers.

For example, legislation has just been enacted which clarifies the rules around enrolling under 18s.

### NZ Superannuation

Of course, KiwiSaver is just one aspect of the Government's retirement policies.

New Zealand Superannuation is another.

My party was a signatory to the 1993 cross-party Accord on Retirement Income Policies.

It was my view then that a universal, adequate, government-funded retirement scheme as delivered by New Zealand Superannuation needs to be the foundation of our retirement provision.

I am still of that view today.

New Zealand fares well against its OECD counterparts on measures of old age poverty.

New Zealand Superannuation provides people with a safety net.

It is a solid foundation on which further supplements such as KiwiSaver can be added to provide further financial security.

The universal aspect of New Zealand Superannuation means that it does not provide the disincentives for retirees to work and save that are associated with means- and income-tested overseas schemes.

With our ageing population this becomes increasingly important.

One way of keeping the ratio of workers to beneficiaries manageable is to increase the length of peoples' working lives.

The effective lifting of a statutory retirement age in the mid 1990s has effectively achieved that.

An advantage of New Zealand Superannuation is that it enables people to maintain participation in the workforce in their own way and on their own terms.

This may be part-time employment and so on.

Such on-going workforce participation is often what people want and has benefits other than financial.

It keeps them socially engaged and active.

Along with improving the environment for savings, we want an economy that promotes wise investment at a public and private level.

### Investment

In this regard, the Government has agreed on six policy drivers aimed at lifting New Zealand's long-run growth rate and reducing the vulnerability of the economy to external shocks.

These are:

1.  a better regulatory environment for business
2.  a better, smarter public sector
3.  support for science, innovation and trade
4.  a focus on higher skills for our labour force
5.  productive infrastructure investment, and
6.  a fair and efficient tax system

There is a strong focus here on investment for the future.

While increasing levels of investment should in general lift our long-run growth rate, it is the quality of investment that matters most.

As a government, we are putting investment in:

> \- the public sector  
> \- science, innovation and trade  
> \- skills, and  
> \- infrastructure.

Many of us will recall the days when New Zealand invested heavily but poorly.

We invested in car manufacturing plants that produced sub-standard cars at inflated costs.

And of course we invested heavily in the "Think Big" projects of the Muldoon era.

The level of investment in the economy results from a partnership between the Government and the private sector.

Obviously the Government will undertake most of the investment required for a better, smarter public sector and for education and infrastructure.

This investment needs to be of high quality.

These government investments are needed to build a better base to support the private sector investment that is crucial for our long-run economic prospects.

As Minister of Revenue, I have a particular interest in the role of the tax system in promoting the Government's agenda.

For investment by the private sector, the tax system has a significant impact.

Investment is a positive thing, but where New Zealanders are making investments, we want investment decisions to be driven by the quality, and not just the tax advantages that may derive from them.

A fair and efficient tax system creates the right incentives for quality private sector investment.

Therefore we have resisted the temptation to reintroduce tax incentives - a path that has proven inefficient and ineffective in the past.

We have continued to emphasise a broad based, low rate system that does not distort market incentives.

These themes were well illustrated in the 2010 Budget.

### Budget 2010

Much of the last Budget arose from the work of the Tax Working Group.

The group comprised leading tax professionals, academics and business and labour representatives, assisted by IRD and the Treasury officials.

The Tax Working Group took much of last year to prepare a comprehensive report that emphasised the need for coherence and integrity in the tax system, recommended lowering tax rates and emphasised the need for a more efficient balancing of effective tax rates across sectors.

In particular, it noted that a low effective rate of tax appeared to be contributing to New Zealand's over-investment in property.

The Budget responded positively to these recommendations.

It introduced measures designed to boost savings, investment and productivity, while maintaining the integrity of the tax system.

The Budget was perhaps the most comprehensive shake-up of the tax system in 20 years and introduced a number of significant changes, including:

*   lower tax rates for individuals and businesses. The lower rates encourage individuals to work, invest and save, increasing wealth and productivity.
*   a rise in the GST rate. The rate increase funded the income tax decreases so that they were implemented in a fiscally responsible manner and helped to tilt the incentives for New Zealanders away from consumption and toward savings. The shift away from income tax and towards GST will ensure that ordinary New Zealanders see an increase in their take-home pay and will encourage them to save for retirement.
*   changes to the taxation of investment property. The changes removed biases which favoured such investment at the expense of other more productive uses.
*   A lower capped tax rate for PIEs that encourages savings.

All of these changes improve long-run growth and productivity and yield a better fiscal basis in order to provide a more secure environment to sustain future obligations of government, for example in the area of pensions.

The Budget measures also significantly improved the integrity and fairness of the tax system by removing the tax advantage that could be gained by sheltering income in trusts.

The top tax rate for individuals is now the same as the trust tax rate.

Of course our work does not end with the delivery of a Budget and Budget implementation work continues.

Moreover the government is moving to examine other major policy areas.

### Savings Working Group

Over the longer term, part of the Government's economic strategy is to move away from unsustainable reliance on credit.

Until we address that, our economy will continue to be vulnerable.

The Government is concerned that New Zealand places too high a reliance on foreign capital to fund investment and consumption - a reliance that makes New Zealand more vulnerable to foreign shocks. For example:

*   New Zealand has run a current account deficit every year since 1973. National investment has continuously exceeded savings, with the difference funded by offshore borrowing.
*   There is an increasing net debt to the world. Looking across government, households and business, it has almost doubled since 2000.

One only needs to look at the problems in Europe today to see the risks that can arise when there are imbalances of these sorts.

It is important however not to be too alarmist about these numbers.

We start out with an internationally low ratio of government debt to GNP, meaning that there is no concern about our ability to fund its obligations.

And borrowing from abroad is a good thing if it funds investments that earn more than the cost of that borrowing.

(An important reason is that it is necessary to avoid tax incentives that encourage unprofitable investments.)

Nevertheless, it is prudent to ask: can we do better?

The Savings Work Group launched last month will look at these issues.

The Group's scope will include:

*   The role of government savings as part of New Zealand's overall savings picture, including long-term savings/debt targets and the interaction of government and private savings.
*   The impact of the tax system on the level and composition of national savings and investment decisions.
*   The role of KiwiSaver in improving national savings.

The examination of the tax system will be far-ranging, including such fundamental questions of whether the tax system should be indexed for inflation or whether a dual income system, also known as the Nordic system should be introduced.

A Nordic tax system levies a lower tax rate on capital investment relative to income from labour, (including entrepreneurial labour).

These and other options will be examined according to standard tax policy criteria of:

*   Impact on government revenues
*   Efficiency,
*   Fairness and
*   Complexity.

It must also be recognised that international evidence has shown that taxation alone does not have a significant impact on the level of savings, although it can certainly have an impact of how savings are made and where they are invested.

The Group will recommend policy options in January next year.

Savings and capital formation are essential parts of any economy and we need to create a favourable economic environment for that.

It is my firm view that the Government is rolling up its sleeves and tackling this as best it can.

I believe that the work we are doing now is going to pay off for New Zealanders in saving and investing for a better future.

Thank you very much.

Minister’s address to Chambers of Commerce conference
=====================================================

The Minister of Revenue’s [speech](/news/2010/2010-09-16-ministers-address-chambers-commerce-conference#speech)
 to the annual Chambers of Commerce conference provided an update on Budget-related and other key pieces of work.

Hon Peter Dunne  
Minister of Revenue

SPEECH

Address NZ Chambers of Commerce  
'Creating Opportunities'  
Palmerston North  
10am, Thursday, 16 September 2010

Good morning and thank you for the invitation to address your Conference today.

I am especially pleased to be speaking here today given your conference theme of 'Creating opportunities'.

I am delighted that Chambers of Commerce are looking to the future now and to the opportunities we face as we emerge from recession.

However, before we start that I must acknowledge the impact of the Canterbury earthquake and its aftermath.

Inland Revenue is involved in dealing with just one aspect of the wider consequences of the earthquake.

Issues such as destroyed records, financial hardship and the late payment of tax all need to be addressed, as do a host of technical issues that the Department is working on.

Of course, I appreciate that these are near the bottom of the list of things Canterbury people will be focusing on right now, and understandably so, but it is nevertheless important that Inland Revenue is ready to deal with people effectively and fairly when the appropriate time comes.

In particular, I have been extremely impressed with how swiftly the Canterbury Employers' Chamber got back on its feet and swung into action supporting the community.

Our thoughts are with Peter Townsend and his team and with the entire Canterbury region.

I certainly applaud their indomitable spirit in the face of adversity as they rebuild Canterbury's future.

But then as a Cantabrian by birth and upbringing, albeit doing a long OE in Wellington, I am not surprised.

The theme of your conference - creating opportunities - seems particularly pertinent to you today.

This Government is very much about opportunities.

We see our role as not so much to create the opportunities, but to provide an environment where New Zealanders have the chance to reach their potential.

Part of that is creating a good business and economic environment.

### Policy drivers for growth

The Government has agreed on six policy drivers aimed at lifting New Zealand's long-run growth rate and reducing the economy's vulnerability to external shocks.

These are:

1\. a better regulatory environment for business  
2\. a better smarter public sector  
3\. support for science, innovation and trade  
4\. a focus on higher skills for our labour force  
5\. productive infrastructure investment, and  
6\. a fair and efficient tax system

This year's Budget was designed to boost savings, investment and productivity.

At the same time, work will continue on protecting and maintaining the integrity of the tax system, while ensuring that our tax system is as simple as possible and is internationally competitive.

We know that for business to flourish we need to remove as many bureaucratic impediments as possible and I am pleased to be able to report significant progress in this regard.

The tax policy work programme is most focused on delivering a fair and efficient tax system and a better and smarter public sector.

The Government priorities in the tax area are:

1.  implementing the measures announced in the Budget
2.  changing the way Inland Revenue operates through the Transform IR programme
3.  international tax reform, and
4.  the work of the recently announced Savings Working Group.

I will start with this year's Budget.

### Budget 2010

The Budget was perhaps the most comprehensive shake-up of the tax system in the last twenty years and introduced a number of significant changes, including lower tax rates for individuals, businesses and savers, a rise in the GST rate, and changes to the investment property rules.

It also significantly improves the integrity and fairness of the tax system by removing the main tax advantage that could be gained by sheltering income in trusts.

The shift away from income tax and towards GST will ensure that ordinary New Zealanders see an increase in their take-home pay and will encourage them to save for retirement.

Recently I was pleased to be able to announce we were bringing forward the repeal of a tax.

The Budget had already signalled the repeal of fund withdrawal tax.

What we did at the end of August was to hasten its departure following feedback from taxpayers.

Fund withdrawal tax is levied on certain superannuation funds and served a particular purpose, but it was obsolete and past its use by date.

Prolonging its demise was simply imposing unwarranted compliance costs on taxpayers.

We have therefore repealed it and that will take effect from 1 April next year.

Repealing an unwarranted tax is a good thing for a government to do to stimulate the economy.

We are now, as I have previously announced, turning our attention gift duty.

As you know, I announced in June the Government's intention to repeal gift duty, subject to issues relating to creditor protection and social assistance eligibility being satisfactorily resolved.

Officials have been consulting widely on these aspects, and while final decisions are yet to be made, I remain hopeful our original objective can be achieved.

### GST amendments

Other recent legislative amendments have included GST transitional arrangements to help ensure businesses are not unnecessarily impacted by the 1 October rise in GST.

These arrangements largely affect transactions that straddle the implementation date.

Certain successive supplies, such as insurance, finance leases and lay-by contracts that straddle the 1 October date will be able to continue at the 12.5% rate for a transitional period to reduce compliance costs.

The transitional periods will vary for the type of supply concerned

There are also measures to better align the GST time of supply rules with business practices.

A further provision extends the remission of late payment penalties and the associated interest for GST returns to cover the period immediately before 1 October.

These various GST measures were the result of the work of the GST Advisory Panel which I announced in May, and which has proven itself very useful in identifying issues that the business community faced with the increase in the GST rate.

At the time of the Budget, we knew there would be some transitional issues, but in the context of Budget secrecy, we were not entirely sure what they would be.

I think the process we adopted has allowed us to identify and fix those issues, and I see it as indicative of the pragmatic, solution-focused approach that this Government takes.

On a related matter, the Budget proposals on GST phoenix schemes are in legislation currently before Parliament.

### Depreciation

Meanwhile, submissions have just closed on another piece of work flowing out of the Budget - two sets of suggested changes to remove uncertainty around depreciation of assets, including the fit-out of non-residential buildings and depreciation loading for certain assets acquired before Budget 2010.

The officials' issues paper suggests an option to clarify the law on when non-residential fit-outs can be depreciated separately from the building.

The second clarification relates to the 'grandparenting' of depreciation-loading for certain assets acquired before Budget 2010 and it is suggested that depreciation-loading should apply when there was a commitment to purchase or construct an asset prior to 20 May 2010.

Officials will report to the Minister of Finance and me with their final policy proposals in due course.

As I have said, the Government intends to have the necessary clarifications in law before 1 April 2011.

### LAQCs

As part of Budget 2010, the Government announced that it would replace the current qualifying company rules for closely held companies with a new set of rules to make qualifying companies and loss attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs) flow-through entities for income tax purposes.

This would provide a tax treatment similar to that of limited partnerships and so income would be taxed and losses deducted at a shareholder's marginal tax rate.

The purpose of this reform is to address a number of problems with the current rules which undermine the integrity of the tax system.

These problems include the abuse of the qualifying company regime particularly in the property area.

There was also concern that there may be arbitrage opportunities resulting from qualifying company profits being taxed at the company rate while the losses of LAQCs are allowed as a deduction from a shareholder's annual gross income, which may be taxed at a higher rate.

An issues paper seeking public comment on the implementation and transition details of moving LAQCs and qualifying companies to a flow-through treatment for income tax purposes was released in May.

Consultation on these proposals has proved very helpful.

One area of particular concern that has been raised is whether qualifying companies can continue to operate in their current form, but without the loss attribution provisions.

Feedback has been that small enterprises like the qualifying companies approach, and do not want to move to a full flow-through treatment.

In essence whereas there is considerable support for the Governments moves against LAQCs, the message we have received is that the QC regime \[other than LAQCs\] has not been abused and should be left in its present form thus avoiding significant compliance costs.

I am sympathetic to the points raised about existing qualifying companies, but on the other hand, I am aware of officials' concerns about the proliferation of the number of statutory tax rules by keeping the qualifying company rules without loss attribution, while adding a flow-through company tax regime to it.

The Government is currently considering its response to these submissions, and we hope to release final proposals and the consequential draft legislation for external comment shortly.

### Social Assistance integrity

Another very important aspect of the tax system is its administration of social assistance programmes.

Such social assistance programmes fulfil a very real function for our society, but people should not receive different levels of assistance according to how they structure their affairs or the manner in which they receive income to live on.

This is inequitable and inconsistent with social assistance objectives.

There are many much more worthy uses for taxpayer funds.

Therefore, as part of Budget 2010, the Government announced that it would reform the definition of income used for determining entitlements to certain social assistance programmes, namely, Working for Families tax credits, student allowances and community services cards.

The Government provides a range of programmes to ensure that people have a minimum standard of living, and have access to health and education and identifies those people in genuine need.

Entitlements to these three programmes are based on the definition of "taxable income" in the Income Tax Act 2007 therefore, how income is defined is crucial to the proper targeting of these social assistance programmes.

The purpose of the reforms is to improve the integrity of these social assistance programmes.

An officials' issues paper was released on 30 August and submissions close on 24 September.

On all these Budget-related matters, we have as far as possible, instituted processes for identifying implementation issues that could cause problems, especially for small businesses.

We have demonstrated a pragmatic and sensible approach for fixing these in a way that does not undermine the policy announced in the Budget.

It is in the spirit of being sensible and pragmatic, that we are undertaking the Transform IR programme.

### Transform IR

To make the tax system more efficient, we need to help people more easily manage their tax affair and, remove inequalities.

And in achieving all of that, we need to maintain the integrity of the system.

The Government recently consulted the public on proposals to remove complexity from the tax system by reducing the use of paper forms in administering the tax system and increasing online services and technology.

Essentially, this would help reduce administrative and compliance costs, with Inland Revenue moving to a greater emphasis on electronic interaction with taxpayers.

Businesses, employers and the non-profit sector would have software which takes care of routine PAYE compliance tasks, such as the need to separately file an employer monthly schedule by automatically communicating with Inland Revenue.

The software could allow for the provision of information to Inland Revenue on a payday basis.

The key proposal is to help people more easily manage their own tax affairs and entitlements online through their own secure area on Inland Revenue's website - like internet banking.

If adopted, these proposals could do away with the millions of letters, forms and booklets which are printed, filled out, and posted today.

This move to online transactions will also apply to businesses - the proposal is that business' accounting software will be able to take care of routine tax obligations without the need to fill in separate forms.

There are some ideas around the annual square-up process.

At the moment, people who think they might get a refund can check online, then request a personal tax summary to confirm they have a refund - which is paid into their bank account - or a tax bill they have to pay.

Under the proposal, the risk of errors in PAYE deducted each payday would be greatly reduced, so for many people there would be no end-of-year square-up and refund, but no tax bill either.

People were also asked for views on proposals to share some information with other government departments - with appropriate safeguards - to enable cheaper, more efficient services for the customer.

Consultation closed at the end of July and there was considerable public interest in the proposals.

Officials are working through the several hundred submissions made both in writing and - in this case most appropriately - through the online forum.

I hope to make further announcements about this important area of development, and the other matters included in the consultation, over the coming months.

We are also looking beyond our borders for opportunities to remove obstacles and want New Zealand businesses to be competitive abroad as well as at home.

### International Tax Reform

The international tax rules were fundamentally reformed last year as new exemptions were put in place for active income earned through offshore subsidiaries and for foreign dividends received by New Zealand companies.

These reforms will help New Zealand-based businesses to compete more effectively in foreign markets by freeing them from tax and compliance costs that similar companies in other countries do not face.

In particular, last year's changes brought New Zealand's rules more into line with Australia's.

Of course, not all New Zealand businesses that are looking to expand internationally will want to do so through subsidiaries.

In coming months, legislation will therefore be introduced to extend the active income exemption from foreign subsidiaries to other foreign associates in which a resident has a significant interest, such as joint ventures.

Subsequent extensions of the active income exemption are planned for offshore branches of resident companies, and for financial institutions with active offshore operations.

At the same time as the reform of domestic legislation has been in full swing, international tax agreement work has been progressing well.

Inland Revenue's negotiating team has been very active.

New treaties with the US and Australia have recently reduced, and in some cases eliminated, non-resident withholding tax on dividends, interest and royalties.

Further negotiations will focus on securing similar reductions in withholding rates with other treaty partners.

Negotiations are now under way with the United Kingdom and Canada, with more to follow.

Another significant piece of work going on in the international tax area, focusing on the attractiveness of New Zealand to foreign investors, is a measure to remove withholding tax on interest paid to non-residents in some circumstances.

Consultation on this measure is largely complete and legislation is likely to be introduced before the end of the year.

This measure will make it easier for New Zealand businesses to seek offshore funding by means of a public bond issue.

The Government also released a consultation document earlier this year floating the idea of a tax exemption for foreign income earned by non-resident investors in a PIE, which brings me to savings and investment.

### Savings Working Group

Over the longer term, part of the Government's economic strategy is to move away from unsustainable reliance on credit.

Until we address that, our economy will continue to be vulnerable.

Over the next four years, New Zealand's net debt (private and public sector) is projected to grow to more than our income.

That is obviously concerning.

Where New Zealanders are making investments, we want investment decisions to be driven by the quality of the particular investments, not just the tax advantages that may derive from them.

The bottom line is that we have tended to spend more than we earn, and when we invest, we have favoured property.

Savings and capital formation are essential parts of any economy and we need to create a favourable economic environment for that.

The Savings Work Group launched last month will look at the impact of the tax system, particularly the taxation of income from savings and investment on the level and composition of national savings and investment decisions.

So how do you encourage a national interest in savings?

All options have to be considered.

The recent Henry Review in Australia set out how Australia might reduce tax on capital and increase tax on labour income.

This is something we clearly need to investigate for New Zealand and the Savings Working Group will therefore consider the case for moving to a dual income tax system, where labour and savings and investment income might be taxed at different rates.

It will also look at indexation or part indexation of the tax system so that real, rather than nominal, savings and investment income is taxed.

The Group's scope will include:

*   The role of Government savings as part of New Zealand's overall savings picture, including long-term savings/debt targets.
*   The impact of the tax system on the level and composition of national savings and investment decisions.
*   The role of KiwiSaver in improving national savings.

The Working Group will hold a series of six meetings, before a final working session in December, with interim papers to be made public along the way.

The Working Group is scheduled to report to the Minister of Finance with options for improved national savings in January next year.

The work I have discussed so far apply generally to businesses, but of course the Government aims to provide opportunities for all to get ahead.

### Child Support

When families break up, the best solution is always for parents to try and work out their own arrangements for the ongoing financial support for their children.

It is by far best for parents to reach private agreements on their financial contributions and care arrangements for their children, without State intervention.

However for some, this cannot be avoided and in 1992, the Child Support scheme was introduced.

For the sake of people in such a situation, it is up to us to ensure that the scheme is run as efficiently and fairly as possible.

The common consensus - and I agree with it - is that there are too many occasions when the scheme is not fair; too many instances where people are rightly aggrieved but its outcomes, be they paying parents or custodial parents.

The current scheme is outdated and does not take into account changing family dynamics.

The Government needs to ensure that the best incentives to pay are in place so that child support payments are made on time and voluntarily.

I do believe this is much more achievable when people feel that that system is fair and truly there for the benefit of their children.

We are also concerned about the level of debt generated.

With fines and penalties, it now stands at just under $2 billion.

Earlier this month I released a discussion document outlining proposals for addressing these issues and re-shaping the Child Support scheme.

Consultation closes on 29 October.

It has already attracted a huge level of public interest, confirming to me the fact that reform in this area was overdue.

### Income sharing

Another discussion document I released recently deals with Income Sharing for parents of dependent children.

You may well be aware that I have promoted this for many years as the leader of UnitedFuture, and I am now driving it as Revenue Minister.

Essentially Income Sharing would allow couples who decide to have one parent at home looking after the children do so without the full financial sacrifice they have to make today.

It is a decision that really costs them, and we want to do something to ease that cost and recognise the importance of the choice they are making in a practical way.

And that practical way is that up to 310,000 New Zealand families could benefit by up to $9,000 a year, making one of them spending more time raising their children a viable choice.

And that in a nutshell is what it is about - choice.

Families who choose to have one parent stay at home to raise their children should not be disadvantaged for doing so.

There are families where parents would prefer to have one parent at home to raise their children but are compelled instead to both be at work because of financial reasons, this Bill may give those families greater options.

I have heard a lot of criticism of the proposal which is largely misplaced.

Some have said it is a taxpayer subsidy to the better-off families - the Labour Party managed to go even further and insult every woman in New Zealand by dismissing it as a tax handout to the wives of rich law partners.

In fact, it is none of these.

It is allowing people to keep more of their household income, in recognition of the vital role both parents play in raising their children.

And they also have the choice whether they opt into the scheme or not.

I cannot understand how it can be acceptable for business partners to be able to share their incomes for tax purposes - but not acceptable in the case of arguably the most important business of all, the individual household.

The Income Sharing Bill will have its first reading next week and will be referred to a select committee for public submissions.

If it passes into law, it will come into effect in 2012.

Income sharing, like everything else I have been talking to you about is about a better future.

My overall message to you is that while the economic recovery may be cautious, the Government is working hard to establish a fertile ground to nurture that recovery.

And when recovery is better established, the work we are doing now will present New Zealand businesses and employers with the opportunities for a better future.

The people you represent in communities up and down New Zealand are a very important part of that future, and that is why it has been a pleasure to address you this morning.

Thank you.

GST zero-rating of emissions units transactions
===============================================

Feedback is requested on [proposed amendments](/news/2010/2010-10-01-gst-zero-rating-emissions-units-transactions#proposed-amendments)
 to correct an error identified in recent amendments which appear to have the effect of zero-rating supplies made in exchange for supplies of emissions units beyond the original intention of certain supplies made to or by government. The Minister of Revenue has advised that he intends to correct this error in a Supplementary Order Paper to the [Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill 2010](/bills/182-1)
.

* * *

### GST zero-rating of emissions units transactions - proposed amendments

The provisions of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 which zero-rate certain transactions in emissions units were amended by the Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver and Remedial Matters) Act 2010. An error in those amendments appears to have the effect of zero-rating supplies made in exchange for supplies of emissions units beyond the original intention of certain supplies made to or by government.

The Minister of Revenue has advised that he intends to correct this error in a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill 2010 to be proposed at the Committee of the Whole House stage. The correcting legislation will have a commencement date of 1 July 2010, the date the error arose.

The policy intention of the legislation (and its form prior to the recent amendment) was that a very limited range of other supplies made in exchange for emissions units were also zero-rated, essentially for compliance reasons. These other supplies were circumstances where the other party was the government, and the supply was the supply by a person to the government of:

*   the capture of carbon in a growing forest, under the post-1989 forestry or Permanent Forest Sink Initiative rules; or
*   services where the government transfers emissions units to a person as a grant or subsidy. This supply of services is deemed by a provision of the GST Act, and is likely to arise, for example, in circumstances where the government transfers emissions units to a trade-exposed exporter.

The impact of this error is illustrated by the following example.

![Example - Impact of GST zero-rating of emissions units transactions error](/-/media/project/ir/tp/news/2010/2010-10-01-gst-zero-rating-emissions-units-transactions/2010-10-01-example.png?sc_lang=en&modified=20200910055452&hash=42FD8E27D84A2DDD79E501489D9BD76B)  
  
In the example, an industrial consumer used to purchase $100 (plus GST) of oil from a supplier. After the introduction of the ETS, the supplier now charges an emission unit plus $100 plus GST rather than increasing the cash price of the oil to take into account its liability under the ETS. The oil supplier is directly passing on its ETS liability. The GST payable by the oil supplier (and claimable by the industrial consumer) on the supply of oil is intended to be on the total value of the supply being $100 plus the value of the emissions unit.

The error has inadvertently extended the zero-rating of the reciprocal transaction to taxpayer to taxpayer transactions where a supply of emissions units is part or all of the consideration for an underlying supply. In the above example, if the legislative error was not corrected, the proportion of the supply of oil or gas that is equal to the value of the emissions units would be zero-rated.

#### Proposed amendment to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

Commencement date 1 July 2010.

1\.    Section 11(1)(o) to be replaced by the following:

> “(o) the goods are supplied to or by the Crown as consideration for a supply-

> 
>        (ii) that is chargeable at the rate of 0% under section 11A(1)(s) or (t).”

2\.    Section 11A(1)(u) to be replaced by the following:

Qualifying company reforms: questions and answers
=================================================

Today the Minister of Revenue released [questions and answers](/news/2010/2010-10-12-qualifying-company-reforms-questions-and-answers#questionsandanswers)
 that provide further detail on the qualifying company reforms. The draft legislation and commentary will be available this Friday for people to give feedback on.

### Qualifying company reforms: questions and answers

Further to my press release yesterday: qualifying company reforms announced, a series of questions and answers are listed below to provide further detail on the reforms. The draft legislation and commentary will be available at: www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz on Friday this week for people to give feedback on.

**Questions and answers**

**1\. What are the main changes?**

i. Introduce new flow-through income tax rules for closely-held companies.

ii. Allow existing QCs and LAQCs to transition into the new flow-through tax rules or change to another business vehicle such as a limited partnership, without a tax cost.

iii. Allow existing qualifying companies (QCs) and LAQCs to continue to use the current QC rules without the ability to attribute losses (until a review of the dividend rules for closely-held companies has been completed).

**2\. What do the new flow-through rules mean?**

These new rules mean shareholders will pay tax on the company's profit, and use losses, at their marginal tax rate. This is different from the existing LAQC rules because shareholders are being taxed on the income as well. This reduces arbitrage opportunities between the company tax rate and top personal tax rates.

The introduction of new flow-through income tax rules for closely held-companies who choose to use them was announced in Budget 2010.

The new rules create a new tax entity, called a look-through company (LTC). Shareholders of a closely-held company can elect to become an LTC.

A LTC's income, expenses, tax credits, rebates, gains and losses are passed on to its shareholders, in accordance with their shareholdings in the company.

**3\. Is an LTC still a company?**

Yes. The LTC retains its identity as a registered company, and will keep its corporate obligations and benefits under general company law, such as limited liability.

Look-through treatment applies for income tax purposes only; the shareholders of an LTC are regarded as holding the LTCs assets directly, and carrying on the activities of the LTC personally. Thus, in general, a sale of shares in an LTC is treated as a sale of the underlying assets. There are de minimus rules that limit the application of this treatment. These will be closely modelled on the present partnership de minimus rules.

4\. If I am a shareholder in a look-through company (LTC) can I claim all the company's losses against my other income?

Not always. The LTC rules also include a loss limitation rule, which is similar to that of limited partnerships. This means owners can offset tax losses only to the extent the losses reflect their economic loss.

Any losses a shareholder cannot use are carried forward and may be used by the shareholder in later years.

**5\. Why are the QC rules continuing in the interim?**

As part of Budget earlier this year the Government announced reforms to the tax rules for qualifying companies, and sought feedback on the proposals.

Following this consultation, the Government is introducing new rules from 1 April 2011, providing flow-through income tax treatment for closely-held companies who choose to use them.

In response to feedback from small business the Government has also decided to review the tax rules for dividends, with a view to simplifying them for closely-held companies.

It is appropriate that while this review is being conducted, existing qualifying companies and LAQCs can continue to use the current qualifying company rules, but without the ability to attribute losses.

**6\. What is happening to the current qualifying company and LAQC rules?**

Existing QC and LAQCs may continue to use the current QC rules.

The income is taxed at the company level. Dividends will continue to be taxed as before.

*   Only dividends with imputation credits attached will be taxable to shareholders.
*   Any capital gains can be distributed tax free without winding up the company.

However the ability to attribute losses will be removed; this effectively means that the LAQC rules will be abolished.

The current QC rules will remain while the Government reviews the tax rules for dividends, with a view to simplifying them for closely held companies.

**7\. I have an existing LAQC - what are my options?**

If you already have an LAQC you have several options to choose from next year. You can, without a tax cost:

i. Continue as a qualifying company (QC), without the ability to attribute losses (which instead will be used at the company level)

*   This is the 'default' option for all existing QCs and LAQCs.
*   You will no longer be able to attribute losses to your shareholders.
*   This applies until the Government has completed its review of the dividend rules for closely-held companies.

ii. Be taxed as an ordinary company.

*   You will need to revoke your LAQC election.
*   Any new losses will have to be used by the company, not the shareholders.
*   And all dividends will be taxable to your shareholders, although imputation credits may be attached.

iii. Be taxed as a look-through company (LTC)

See answer to Question 2 above for details about being an LTC.

iv. Become a limited partnership, an ordinary partnership, or sole trader

*   Special rules will enable you to transition into a limited partnership, partnership or sole trade, with no tax cost.
*   You will need to restructure your business and either make the company non-active or wind it up. The transition rules provide extended time for this restructuring.

**8\. I have an existing QC - what are my options?**

The options for an existing QC are the same as those for an LAQC. The default option is to continue as a QC.

**9\. When will the new LTC rules come into effect?**

The legislation for the new rules is expected to be enacted before the end of this year. The LTC regime will be available from 1 April 2011.

**10\. When will the removal of the LAQC rules come into effect?**

The legislation for the new rules is expected to be enacted before the end of this year and will come into effect from 1 April 2011. They will apply to LAQCs from the income year starting on or after 1 April 2011.

### Fairness, integrity and growth – tax work programme outlined

The Government’s updated tax policy work programme will support steps taken in Budget 2010 to rebalance New Zealand’s economy and strengthen growth, Finance Minister Bill English and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

“We want a tax system that tilts the economy towards work, investment and savings and away from the unsustainable borrowing, consumption and over investment in housing of the past decade,” Mr English said.

“The Government's 1 October tax changes took important steps in this direction and the tax policy work programme we are announcing today is designed to support this.”

The Government’s tax policy work programme is set by the Ministers of Finance and Revenue and released annually.

Releasing details of the work programme in a speech today to the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Mr Dunne said tax policy had an important role to play in supporting a return to strong economic growth.

Mr Dunne also emphasised a continued tight grip on Government spending and prudent investment as measures that were positive for the economy.

The key components of the updated tax policy work programme are:

*   continuing the delivery of Budget 2010 initiatives;
*   the international tax review that continues reform in this area and the negotiation of tax treaties and tax information exchange agreements;
*   supporting the Savings Working Group, including providing advice on recommendations and thinking broadly about the future in this area; and
*   Transform IR, a project which will shape the way Inland Revenue and the tax administration system operates in terms of areas like tax secrecy, collection of debt and general governance.

“These four areas are central to the Government’s plan for lifting economic performance,” said Mr Dunne.

“Some of the key pieces of work under way include the review of depreciation fit-out, an improved disputes process, a review of the child support system, the integrity of social assistance programmes and flow-through income tax treatment for closely held companies.”

“In addition, some base maintenance work, such as profit distribution plans and the valuation of livestock has been included.”

The valuation of livestock project will review the ability to move from one livestock valuation method to another - such as for sheep, beef and dairy cattle. The project will consider the effectiveness of the rules that are designed to prevent movement between the valuation regimes and, in particular, whether it is too easy to leave the herd scheme.

“Officials will be providing briefings as appropriate and consulting on this in the coming months,” concluded Mr Dunne.

###   
Speech

### Keynote address to the 2010 NZICA Tax Conference  
Auckland, Friday 29 October

I am very pleased to have been invited again to open this conference today, and, as is now customary, would like to take the opportunity to share with you details of the mid-term update of the tax policy work programme.

Essentially, as we all know, taxes are required to finance government spending, and tax policy aims to ensure that taxes are raised as fairly and efficiently as possible while maintaining the integrity of the tax system.

This is critical if New Zealand is to have a world class tax system and a strong economy.

As we move out of recession, the Government’s priority is to restore our fiscal position from deficit to surplus, making it crucial that the tax programme be revenue neutral to positive.

This involves managing the growth in expenditure, eliminating waste and improving the efficiency of government spending, as well as maintaining the revenue base.

Tax policy, which can have substantial and wide-ranging effects on the economy, also has an important role to play in supporting a return to strong economic growth – especially by reducing the distortionary effects of taxation.

Its focus must be to enhance productivity and growth and to encourage people to save in ways which provide the best returns to New Zealand as a whole.

The work programme must also protect the integrity of the tax system, while advancing the key economic drivers that Cabinet has decided for all of Government.

So, the four key elements of the work programme therefore are:

*   continuing the delivery of Budget 2010 initiatives;
*   the international tax review that continues the previous reform in the area and the negotiation of tax treaties and tax information exchange agreements;
*   supporting the Savings Working Group which will involve providing advice on recommendations and thinking broadly about the future in this area; and
*   the ongoing development of the Transform IR project that has ramifications for the way that Inland Revenue runs its operations and the way that the tax administration system operates in terms of things like tax secrecy, collection of debt and general governance.

Let me start with the Budget.

### Budget 2010

Budget 2010, as you know, introduced the most comprehensive overhaul of the tax system since the 1980s.

And although the Budget was delivered in May, post-Budget work still remains, though much of it will have been completed by the end of the year.  
The tax switch of the cut in personal taxes and the rise in the GST rate was arguably the most critical point.

Overall, that has been successfully implemented and I want to take this opportunity to thank the Institute for assisting with this.

In particular, I am aware of the significant education exercise that was undertaken by the Institute and its members through road shows and other forms of public communication.

I would also like to thank the GST Advisory Panel and officials who supported the Panel for their work in addressing particular issues that came to their attention after Budget Night.

Owing to the Panel’s considerable efforts, the further transitional measures that were recently implemented were well targeted and appropriate in the specific circumstances to which they apply.

What became clear to us as the process of change unfolded was that because of changes in business technology, the relevance of retained experiences from the last GST rate change in 1989 was not as important as we might otherwise have imagined it to be.

And it is also worth remembering that we did things a little differently from 1989.

For example, unlike then, we ensured full compensation was available, both in the form of generous personal tax cuts, and an immediate adjustment in all Government benefit payments, including New Zealand Superannuation and Government Superannuation occurred at the same time.

No such compensations formed part of the 1989 package, which was implemented in six weeks – not four months as was the case this time – and without the assistance of an expert advisory group, like the GST Advisory Panel.

By and large, notwithstanding the potential disruptive effect of the Canterbury earthquake, and the controversy that blew up over the approach adopted by some utility companies, the 1 October date passed smoothly, and I want to acknowledge the co-operation of all sectors of the business, legal and accounting companies in enabling this to happen.

#### Social assistance integrity

The way in which entitlements to Working for Families, student allowances and community services cards operate will always be of concern to society and the Government.

These schemes are intended to help lower and middle-income families, and there is little argument with that.

However, problems always emerge at the boundaries, or in a few cases where people blatantly try to rip-off the system by hiding income one way or another, or simply misrepresenting what they earn.

Our problems in this area were exacerbated by the incoherent 39 per cent tax rate introduced by the last Labour government.

This encouraged a lot of small businesses to reorganise their affairs and as a consequence, they became aware of the social benefit advantages that they could also derive from these structures.

Inevitably, other people hear about these situations, and so question the fairness of the programmes, which simply detracts from their overall credibility, which in turn can lead Governments to pare them back, and thus unwittingly diminish the value of what they were seeking to do at the time the programmes were established.

The blunt point is that people should not be able to receive more social assistance simply because of how they structure their affairs or receive their income, and that our collective tolerance for those who try to do so should be zero.

We signalled in the Budget that the Government would be cracking down in this area, because the abuse by a few is simply unfair to the many.

An official’s issues paper was released for comment and suggested broadening the definition of family scheme income, which is used to determine entitlements to Working for Families tax credits and other programmes, and using this broader definition for the student allowance parental income test, and for some community services cardholders.

Some submissions questioned whether the cost of implementing the proposals would outweigh any fiscal savings.

Overall the savings are expected to exceed costs but more importantly the aim of these proposals is to enhance the integrity of the programmes rather than simply save government spending on assistance.

The broader scope of the definition would include income from trusts, some fringe benefits, some passive income of children (especially where such income is clearly way out of line with the earning capacity of the child at that stage or life, or even out of step with the apparent earning capacity of their household), and income of non-resident spouses.

Changes to the definition of family scheme income for Working for Families tax credit applications and all new applications for the community services card would apply from 1 April 2011.

The Government has accepted those proposals and legislation to give effect to them should be enacted before the end of the year.

The new definitions could also apply to all new applications for student allowances from 1 January 2012.

#### Qualifying companies

The Government is introducing new rules from 1 April 2011, providing flow-through income tax treatment for closely-held companies who choose to use them.  
  
The new rules will allow a business to still have the benefits of a company, such as limited liability, but will mean that business income and losses will be passed to shareholders who will pay any tax due.

In response to feedback from small business, we have also decided to review the tax rules for dividends, with a view to simplifying them for closely held companies.

In the interim, existing qualifying companies and LAQCs will be able to continue to use the current qualifying company rules, but without the ability to attribute losses.

Draft legislation for these changes has been prepared and circulated for comment.

That allows existing qualifying companies and LAQCs to transition into the new flow-through rules, or change to another business vehicle such as a limited partnership, without a tax cost.

The final legislation for the new rules will be introduced in late November and I expect it to be enacted before the end of this year.

#### Depreciation - fit-out review

As you will be aware, this year’s Budget removed depreciation on most buildings - starting from the next income year.  
This was on the basis of data suggesting that most buildings, on average, were not in fact depreciating, and the additional revenue it will produce will help pay for the tax cuts.

However, in removing depreciation from buildings we acknowledged it was imperative to provide clarity regarding the depreciation treatment of items that were attached to commercial and industrial buildings – such as fit-out.

The intention has always been that owners of commercial and industrial buildings should continue to depreciate their building fit-out in the same way as they are doing now.

Since Budget 2010 officials have been working on proposals to achieve this.

An issues paper was released suggesting how the boundary could be clarified and we received a number of useful submissions.

As a result of this process the Government has agreed to amend the proposal in certain areas to better reflect existing practice and allow greater access to the rules that provide transitional relief.

The proposal will be legislated for later this year.

#### GST – Phoenix schemes

The August 2010 tax bill contains a wide range of largely remedial and/or technical measures mostly relating to improvements to the GST system.

The Government is tackling GST fraud in the property area as a matter of priority as this issue has been an ongoing one not just for New Zealand, but for the vast number of countries that have a GST or VAT system.

The bill is reaching its final stages of the Select Committee process and is expected to be reported back to the House in the next few weeks.

### International tax reform

It is critical that the tax system does not stand in the way of businesses growing and thriving in New Zealand and beyond. And it is also important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to invest in and a more attractive place to base multi-national enterprises.

Therefore we need to continue our focus on ensuring that our tax rules are internationally competitive and our rules on the taxation of offshore investment are in line with international norms.

The Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Bill which will have its first reading next month, provides consistency of tax treatment between similar types of foreign investment by extending the active income exemption and active business test (with some small modifications) to non-portfolio foreign investment funds (FIFs).

It also extends and rationalises the portfolio FIF reforms so that those investors who are unable to use the active income exemption (due to having an insufficient shareholding or access to information) will generally be taxed on an assumed 5% rate of return (fair dividend rate method).

The main exception to these rules is for foreign companies that are located in Australia.

Investors in these companies will not need to attribute income under the rules.

The Government also intends to make New Zealand a more attractive place to invest in by lowering withholding taxes through double tax agreements.

As you may know, the negotiation of tax treaties (otherwise known as double tax agreements, or DTAs) has had significant importance on the tax policy work programme for some time.

For the last two years, our focus has been on securing lower withholding tax rates on dividends and royalties in our existing DTAs with key trading and investment partners.

We have also been updating our information exchange Article to reflect the broader scope of that Article in the new OECD model.

A new DTA with Australia entered into force earlier this year as did one with Singapore.

Meanwhile a Protocol that amends our DTA with United States has been approved and awaits ratification.

We are currently negotiating with Canada and the UK.

At the same time, as appropriate, we continue to extend our existing treaty network.

Accordingly, we have signed a new DTA with Turkey this year, and negotiations with Hong Kong have begun.

The economic case for a DTA with Hong Kong, one of the main financial and trading centres of Asia-Pacific, is obvious.

Until recently, Hong Kong would not enter into exchange of information arrangements acceptable to us and other OECD countries.

However, that has now changed and Hong Kong is certainly a priority for us, as it is now for many other countries.

Inland Revenue’s DTA negotiation team has therefore never been busier.  
Yet, the question has been raised on a number of occasions recently whether New Zealand should make a greater effort to increase the size of its DTA network.

This is an interesting question.

New Zealand’s network of DTAs currently stands at 35 DTAs in force.

This is comparable with Australia’s network of 43 DTAs.

Other countries appear to have different ideas about the ideal size of a DTA network.

Some like Canada and the United Kingdom have very large networks – in the vicinity of 100 or more.

Others, however, like Japan and the United States, have relatively modest sized networks (both with 50-odd agreements).

Compared with these countries, the size of New Zealand’s network seems to be respectable.

From a strategic perspective, we also need to be clear about our reasons for entering into DTAs.

DTAs do not come without cost: they give up revenue; they lock in certain positions and affect our ability to change tax policy; they are subject to the vagaries of interpretation; and they need to be maintained.

Accordingly, DTAs should only be entered into when there are clear indications they are likely to be meaningful to New Zealand.

Generally speaking, DTAs will only be meaningful if they are with countries with a significant economic relationship (either current or proposed), or if there are real issues of double taxation at stake or they are substantial economies with advanced tax systems and information exchange and other co-operation will be useful.

Nevertheless, no simple rules are possible and there are often broader reasons why a DTA with a country is in New Zealand’s best interests.

We will prioritise our DTA programme on the basis of the above costs and benefits.

Our currently policy is to have a DTA network more in line with that of Australia, Japan and the United States than the wider network of Canada and the United Kingdom.

### Savings Working Group

Working groups are useful ways for government to connect directly with the people who can provide insight and experience.

The Tax Working Group was highly successful and their recommendations valuable, in my view.

Another working group recently established is the Savings Working Group, to address the critical issue of national savings.

New Zealand has had persistent current account deficits and has an internationally high level of net international indebtedness, both of which. potentially make us more vulnerable to external shocks, such as the recent financial crisis.

Lower income tax rates and an increase in the goods and services tax (GST) rate, announced in Budget 2010, were deliberate moves to tip the economy towards saving, but more needs to be done.

The Savings Working Group's scope includes:

*   The role of Government savings as part of New Zealand's overall savings picture, including long-term savings/debt targets and the interaction of government and private savings.
*   The impact of the tax system on the level and composition of national savings and investment decisions.
*   The role of KiwiSaver in improving national savings.

Taxation affects national savings directly as part of government revenues and indirectly, due to its effect on the incentive to work and save of individuals and households.

The examination of the impact of the tax system on savings will be far-ranging, including such fundamental questions of whether the tax system should be indexed for inflation or whether a dual income system, also known as the Nordic system should be introduced.

A Nordic tax system levies a lower tax rate on capital income relative to income from labour, (including entrepreneurial labour).

In addition to their impact on national savings, these and other options will be examined according to standard tax policy criteria of:

*   impact on government revenues;
*   efficiency;
*   fairness; and
*   simplicity.

It must also be recognised that international evidence suggests that taxation alone does not seem to have a significant impact on the level of savings.

However, taxation can have an impact on the source of those savings and where they are invested if different forms of savings are taxed differently.

### Transform IR

I said before that we have seen the biggest overhaul of the tax system in some years.

Along with the tax system, the tax administration system itself is also being examined with a view to shaping a tax administration meeting society’s needs in the future.

Electronic communication and a greater use of the internet look set to play a larger role in tax administration.

Already we are seeing the first steps in this direction with proposals for greater self-management of one’s affairs online for student loan borrowers.

For businesses, considerable efficiency gains can be reaped from such an approach.

Considering that people already use accountants for managing their tax affairs and tax refund agents to get tax refunds, the Making Tax Easier consultation proposed to move towards a model where businesses’ accounting software sends the relevant tax information on routine tax matters – PAYE, GST and so on through to Inland Revenue.

This approach can bring significant advantages to business and has been chosen for two reasons, which are related.

First, businesses already have the information Inland Revenue needs in their accounting systems.

Enabling business accounting software to deal with tax compliance functions eliminates the time cost to businesses in transcribing information from one system to another.

Second, in order to move away from its paper-based systems, which struggle to deliver the levels of service and access to information people expect in the modern age, Inland Revenue needs to receive information electronically.

This is a system which has been around since time immemorial, and many are comfortable with it.

Providing a facility for their existing accounting system to take care of routine tax for them will give them the chance to weigh up the advantages of moving off paper and into an electronic system.

Of course, there will be some who will say, quite fairly, that they are just as happy using the paper forms.

Compared with that, packaging basic tax compliance into existing accounting packages will result in far greater uptake.

A Software Developers’ Working group has already been established to look into issues and options to allow businesses to connect directly to Inland Revenue’s systems.

A summary of the group’s discussions will be made public on Inland Revenue’s website in due course.

Complex calculations will of course, continue to be the preserve of tax professionals who are required to exercise judgment and apply complex rules which cannot be built into an accounting system.

### Other initiatives

What I have been discussing so far are the key initiatives considered crucial by the Government for advancing its economic objectives.

No less important for a better, fairer tax system are the initiatives which are of administrative function.

Delivering a better and fairer tax system is not just a matter of getting broad tax policy settings right.

The tax system must also meet society’s view as to what is fair and in this regard, a number of initiatives are in train.

#### Child Support Review

September saw the release of a Government discussion document and on-line forum about making wide-ranging improvements to New Zealand’s child support system.

The “Supporting Children” document has proposed the biggest shake-up of child support since its introduction nearly 20 years ago.

The level of interest in the issues raised in the document has been enormous with approximately 1600 submissions received to date.

Clearly the use of on-line consultation has proved highly successful and I expect this to be an ongoing feature of tax and social policy development when needed to reach a wider audience.

More importantly, the number of submissions received undoubtedly reflects the high degree of interest in making the child support system fairer from both parents’ perspective.

Based on the views expressed in submissions, I expect to be recommending significant improvements to the system in the interests of the children that the system is there to protect.

As I have said on a number of occasions, the child support scheme needs to keep pace with a changing society where it is more common for both parents to work and share the care of their children.

It is important that these societal changes be taken into account in the child support formula since a fairer outcome for participants in the scheme is likely to lead to greater compliance.

The discussion document also sets out a range of other options for improving compliance such as the compulsory deduction of child support from salary and wages and improvements to the child support penalties system.

I am expecting officials to report back to me on submissions shortly with a view to the introduction of legislative change around the middle of next year.

#### Disputes Review

I am of course aware that for some time now, NZICA and the New Zealand Law Society have been working closely with Inland Revenue on a range of concerns with the dispute resolution process.

It is satisfying that resolution has been reached on some key matters relating to the administration of the process such as the introduction of facilitators to conferences between the Commissioner and the taxpayer and advice about agreeing to opt-out of the full process.

A number of legislative changes to the process sought by the two organisations will be included in the forthcoming November bill leading to even greater improvement.

I do understand that the measures in that bill will not contain all the changes that taxpayers would like to see – such as a taxpayer unilateral opt-out and statutory timeframes.

This is because I am expecting the significant administrative changes to largely address these concerns.

I have, however, asked that the operational changes be reviewed in two years time and am open to considering further legislative change at that time should significant taxpayer concerns remain.

In the meantime, I encourage the Institute and its members and the New Zealand Law Society to continue the dialogue with Inland Revenue about the disputes process.

#### Gift Duty

Earlier this year I announced the Government’s intention to remove gift duty if concerns regarding creditor protection and social assistance targeting could be addressed.

Since my announcement there has been considerable work done by officials across government to assess these concerns.

In many senses gift duty is an anachronism – it has been around since 1885 – costing about $70 million in annual compliance costs, while raising just over $1.5 million a year.

The officials’ review has made good progress and I intend to announce the outcome of this work shortly.

#### Income Sharing Tax Credit Bill

The confidence and supply agreement between National and UnitedFuture included supporting legislation to the first reading stage to allow couples. raising dependent children the option of income sharing for tax purposes.

This bill was introduced last month and is now being considered by the finance and expenditure committee.

The closing date for public submissions has been extended to 10 December.

The tax credit will effectively refund some of the tax paid by couples caring for children where one partner is on a higher tax rate than the other.

It will mean that different couples on the same level of combined income will effectively pay the same combined amount of personal income tax, regardless of how much each partner earns.

The changes proposed in the bill will also mean some couples have greater choices to work fewer or more flexible hours of paid work in order to care for children, by increasing their combined after-tax income.

Eligible couples with dependent children will be able to apply for the tax credit, if they want, at the end of each tax year.

The amount they receive will depend on the relative amounts of tax payable by each partner on their individual income.

If the legislation is enacted, income sharing for eligible households will be available from 1 April 2012.

#### Use-of-money interest deductibility

For some time there has been a question whether use-of-money interest is deductible.

The Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Bill will contain an amendment clarifying that it is deductible.

The amendment will ensure consistency between companies, for whom this interest is always deductible, and individuals.

The outcome is that use-of-money interest will be both assessable and deductible.

The amendment will apply retrospectively – to the start of the use-of-money interest rules if taxpayers have already claimed deductions.

### Base maintenance

In addition to these initiatives, work on base maintenance integrity and projects to improve the fairness of the tax system will continue.

#### Profit distribution plans (PDPs)

The Government announced on 16 April 2009 that it intended to clarify the law to ensure that bonus issues of shares distributed under PDPs are taxed in the same way as shares issued under other dividend reinvestment plans.

Such legislation is likely to be introduced in mid-2011.

#### Valuation of livestock

The Minister of Finance and I have asked officials to review the livestock valuation elections.

We are concerned at the opportunity for sheep, beef and dairy farmers to exploit the system as it appears that it is too easy to leave the herd scheme.

### Care and management

And finally, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will, I believe, discuss later at this conference, the recently released Interpretation Statement on Care and Management which I appreciate is of interest to you.

The work programme I have announced today is comprehensive and ambitious and will move us forward in building a world leading tax system, while ensuring that the existing system continues to deliver what Government and society expects.

It builds on what has already been a momentous year in tax reform, which has included:

*   the introduction of payroll giving
*   the Budget 2010 tax changes
*   the introduction of the Income Sharing Tax Credit Bill
*   the Child Support Review
*   the revamp of the student loans scheme
*   the Transform IR project
*   the review of gift duty

As both Minister of Revenue and Leader of UnitedFuture I look forward to overseeing the implementation of this programme, and to our ongoing dialogue on future tax reforms.

I also wish you all the best for a successful conference.

SPEECH

### Address Grosvenor Financial Services Group End of Year Conference  
Te Papa, Wellington, Friday, 19 November 2010

Good morning and thank you for inviting me here to address this conference.

It is a pleasure to be here today to talk about something which is of growing importance.

Savings and investment is at the heart of the Government's economic agenda.

I am pleased to talk about work the Government is undertaking to promote savings and investment and also about the issues being considered by the Savings Working Group.

New Zealand's track record on savings and investment has not been good.

Households have spent more than they have earned and when we have invested we have invested in property.

The Tax Working Group identified that rental property generated a negative tax base for the Government.

Budget 2010 took important steps to address these concerns.

But much of the ongoing work in the tax policy area is aimed at ensuring that taxes do not get in the way of individuals and businesses making sensible savings and investment decisions.

Successive Governments have considered how best to address savings, but I think we are now making real headway on the problem.

### Budget

The 2010 Budget contained substantive tax measures to improve the incentives for efficient savings and investment.

These included measures designed to boost savings, investment and productivity, while maintaining the integrity of the tax system such as:

*   _Lowering tax rates for individuals and increasing the GST rate_  
    Lower personal tax rates encourage individuals to work, invest and save, increasing wealth and productivity.  
    The GST rate increase funded a large chunk of the income tax decreases so that they were implemented in a fiscally responsible manner.  
    The switch away from income tax towards GST was all about increasing incentives to save.  
    This is because, unlike an income tax, a goods and services tax does not tax savings as they are earned.  
    The reduction in all personal tax rates have increased the incentives for ordinary New Zealanders to work and get ahead.  
    This is demonstrated by significant increases to take-home pay and lower tax rates on the next dollar earned.
*   _Company tax rate reduction_  
    The reduction in the company tax rate to 28% will increase incentives to invest.  
    With more capital goods, labour is more productive so this encourages productivity and growth.  
    It will also ensure that we remain competitive internationally.
*   _Changes to the taxation of property_  
    As part of Budget 2010, the Government removed depreciation on most buildings beginning for most people from 1 April next year.  
    This was a key component of a fiscally responsible, balanced Budget package and helped pay for the tax cuts.  
    It was also justified on policy grounds as the available data suggested, on average, that buildings were not in fact depreciating over the period measured.  
    This change, along with the changes to qualifying companies, should go some way towards addressing the Tax Working Group's concerns that the residential rental sector is not paying its fair share of tax.
*   _Lower PIE tax rates_  
    Budget 2010 also reduced the top PIE tax rate 30% to 28% as well as reducing the lower PIE tax rates to align with the new lower personal tax rates.  
    This will boost returns to KiwiSaver investments and other long-term savings.
*   _Greater integrity and fairness_  
    The Budget measures also significantly improved the integrity and fairness of the tax system by removing the tax advantage that could be gained by sheltering income in trusts.

The top tax rate for individuals is now the same as the trust tax rate.

### Savings Working Group

We all know that our economy has been unhealthily reliant on offshore borrowing for too long.

As I said before, this is by no means a new problem and one that previous Governments have considered.

To get any sort of traction on the problem, we need new insights and expert solutions.

As you may have noticed, this Government is using 'working groups' in the front-end of the policy-making process.

This is generally achieved by selected businesspeople, private sector advisors and academics working closely together on various policy issues as part of a group.

The Tax Working Group, to my mind, demonstrates how successful the working group model can be.

Academics, practitioners, businesspeople and Government officials came together to consider the direction of New Zealand's tax system.

Their combined efforts not only provided invaluable advice to Government, but also provided a catalyst for public debate on tax policy issues.

The open debates fostered by the Tax Working Group process went a long way to providing the necessary public acceptance that fundamental change to the tax system was necessary.

The Tax Working Group also provided the broad recipe for change - which was largely followed in Budget 2010.

The Government is continuing the working group model with the Savings Working Group - launched earlier this year.

The focus of this group is much broader than just tax.

At the core of the group's terms of reference is to consider ways that New Zealand can move away from its unsustainable reliance on credit.

Until we address that, our economy will continue to be vulnerable.

The Government is concerned that New Zealand places too high a reliance on foreign capital to fund investment and consumption - a reliance that can make New Zealand more vulnerable to foreign shocks.

More specifically the Savings Working Group is looking at:

*   the role of Government savings as part of New Zealand's overall savings picture, including long-term savings and debt targets and the interaction of Government and private savings;
*   the impact of the tax system on the level and composition of national savings and investment decisions and possible options for reform; and
*   the role of KiwiSaver in improving national savings.

The examination of the tax system will be far-ranging and will include:

*   whether the tax system should be indexed for inflation to reduce tax biases between different forms of saving;
*   whether certain forms of capital income such as interest should only be partially taxed as was suggested in the Henry Review in Australia to offset the way in which inflation can lead to this income being overtaxed;
*   whether New Zealand should adopt a Nordic tax system with a low flat tax rate on capital and higher progressive rates only on labour income;
*   whether or not taxes on profits accumulating in retirement savings accounts should be taxed; and
*   whether or not the current capped tax rate for PIEs should be removed (as suggested by the Tax Working Group) or extended to other forms of passive investment income.

At the same time, it is crucial that any changes in this area are responsible and fiscally affordable.

New Zealand's low level of public debt has been important in sustaining New Zealand through the recent great financial crisis.

These are complex and important issues which the Savings Working Group is currently debating.

It will recommend policy options in January next year.

The deliberations of the Savings Working Group and the open debates that this process engenders will be critical in helping the Government come to decisions in this important area.

### Tax focus on savings and investment

As people interested in the health of the retirement system, you will well appreciate the need to think about the long-run impact of policies.

Government has been busy in this area, with significant pieces of legislation passed.

You may remember that the tax rules on savings that previously applied operated very unevenly.

Managed funds were taxed at a flat 33% thereby overtaxing lower income investors on a 19.5% tax rate.

This created a significant tax disincentive for lower income earners to save.

In addition, investment in some countries was favoured over investment in others.

New tax rules for savings came into force during 2007.

These rules consist of the new portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules for managed funds and the fair dividend rate (FDR) rules for offshore portfolio share investments.

The new rules addressed the long standing problems with the taxation of managed funds.

In particular, they have created a much more level playing field between those who invest through managed funds and those that invest directly.

Moreover, as I have already mentioned, the reductions to PIE rates in this year's Budget will further encourage long-term savings in vehicles such as KiwiSaver.

### KiwiSaver

KiwiSaver is a success story for New Zealand.

Its success has exceeded Government expectations.

We have now passed the 1.5 million enrolments mark - a third higher than a year earlier.

It is clear that KiwiSaver has been a very successful policy and has proved to be very attractive to New Zealanders.

KiwiSaver also seems to have raised people's awareness about saving in particular for retirement.

Three years after its introduction, enrolment growth continues to be strong.

KiwiSaver is a major Government programme, and any such programme can always benefit from improvements in the way it is delivered.

We continue to refine the administration and legislation for KiwiSaver to improve certainty and efficiency for savers and providers.

For example, legislation has recently been enacted which clarifies the rules around enrolling under 18s.

As to its future role in the debate about compulsory retirement savings, I await with considerable interest the report from the Savings Working Group in January.

### Trans-Tasman portability

A reality of life in New Zealand is the ease with which people move between New Zealand and Australia for work and travel.

Many people cross the Tasman each year for work and settle there long term.

However when they want to retire to their homeland, they encounter a problem.

Currently, Kiwis who work in Australia must contribute to an Australian complying superannuation fund.

The savings are locked into the Australian scheme until the saver reaches retirement age.

It has been estimated that Australia's Tax Office holds as much as A$13 billion (NZ$16.6 billion) in "lost accounts" in the Australian superannuation system.

Much of this could belong to New Zealanders who have returned home and these new rules will allow these funds to be brought back to New Zealand.

Reflecting the Government's interest in the area of savings, legislation enacted in September improves the portability of retirement savings, and removes an impediment to movement of labour between New Zealand and Australia.

The new rules allow a person who has retirement savings in the Australian complying superannuation funds and New Zealand's KiwiSaver funds to consolidate them in one account in their current country of residence.

This is an important step forward for our wider Single Economic Market programme with Australia, particularly in helping the free movement of labour between the two countries.

The legislation was enacted in New Zealand in September, but the arrangements will not come into affect until Australia has completed its legislative process, which we expect will be in 2011.

It is a good outcome for New Zealanders and the retirement and savings sector.

### Conclusion

There have been important reforms to the tax treatment of savings and investment over a number of years.

But now reform in this area is at the front and centre of the Government's economic reform agenda.

The Government wants open and well-informed debate in this area.

New Zealand is hugely fortunate in having people with a breadth of skills and knowledge willing to work together on these issues to get the best policies for the country as a whole.

Budget 2010 introduced landmark changes following the recommendations of the Tax Working Group.

By reducing personal tax rates and raising GST from 12.5 per cent to 15 per cent, aligning the personal and trustee tax rates, reducing the company tax rate and the top tax rate on PIEs and other savings vehicles and making property less attractive as an investment, we've led the charge and tilted the economy away from consumption and towards saving and investment.

The Savings Working Group is the next step in the process.

It encapsulates the seriousness with which the Government views savings and investment.

Its deliberations will be crucial in the decision-making on whether further changes are necessary in this area and, if so, what they should be.

I believe that the work we are doing now is going to pay off for New Zealanders in saving and investing for a better future.

Thank you very much.

Address to New Zealand Payroll Providers Association
====================================================

In his [address](/news/2010/2010-11-23-address-new-zealand-payroll-providers-association#speech)
 to the annual New Zealand Payroll Providers Asscociation conference, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne discussed KiwiSaver, the Savings Working Group and the future tax administration.

Hon Peter Dunne  
Minister of Revenue

SPEECH

### Address to New Zealand Payroll Providers Association Conference  
Auckland, Tuesday, 23 November 2010

I am very pleased to have been invited to talk to your annual conference once again.

As Minister of Revenue, I spend much of my time in high-level discussion and debate about the economy, and the likely impacts of this or that tax policy.

But a conference is really where the rubber really hits the road.

Businesses need payroll people who can manage the business of paying wages reliably and efficiently.

And efficiency is what I would like to discuss today, as well as the integrity and responsiveness of the tax system in working with businesses and the community.

Since your last conference, the economic climate has changed somewhat.

Conditions are improving after what we now know to have been the worst downturn since the Great Depression.

#### Budget 2010

One of the important contributors to that has been Budget 2010.

The measures the Government took last year were the appropriate response in the immediate aftermath of the global crisis, and the prudence of those measures becomes more obvious each day as the debt crises now facing many of the northern hemisphere economies hit home.

But the global crisis also made it clear that many of our old ways of doing things would have to change to position us well for the future.

That is why Budget 2010 was probably the most important Budget seen in over twenty years, because it had to introduce new policies focusing on promoting growth, integrity and fairness, and I believe the Government delivered on that.

The 2010 Budget was designed with certain principles in mind.

These included promoting a fair and efficient tax system; and better, smarter public services as key steps towards improving economic performance.

The most critical aspects of the Budget were the reduction in personal tax rates, the rise in GST and the measures to limit depreciation on non-residential buildings.

These changes are already paying off for our economy.

They will tilt it towards savings and away from the unsustainable borrowing, consumption and over-investment in housing of the past decade.

And that in turn will improve incentives to work, and to boost production and productivity.

But those objectives are not achieved without a great deal of hard work, and I would like to pay tribute to you payroll professionals for handling the change to the personal tax rates smoothly and without incident.

Ensuring that every worker in the country receives their tax cut correctly, efficiently and on time is hugely important to the government, and your role in achieving has been vital.

So thank you.

#### KiwiSaver

In inviting me here today, the NZPPA chief executive, David Jenkins expressed an interest in hearing my views on KiwiSaver and its role in national savings.

Let me say straight off that in my view, and the views of many financial commentators, KiwiSaver is a success story for New Zealand as it goes from strength to strength.

Many of you will remember when it was launched and you began making deductions from wages.

At the time, KiwiSaver was forecast to reach 276,000 at the end of its first year.

In fact, interest was so strong that there were a net 716,000 enrolments.

Current membership has now passed the 1.5 million mark.

Good though this is, we cannot be too complacent.

The Government remains concerned that New Zealand still places too high a reliance on foreign capital to fund investment and consumption.

While we strongly support foreign investment as necessary and desirable for the development and expansion of the New Zealand economy, and have no desire to shut the doors the way some of our political opponents would, we do acknowledge that being reliant on overseas borrowing, means the economy could be in for a rollercoaster ride as it responds to overseas financial crises.

So to avoid that, it is absolutely imperative we focus on greater productivity and accumulation of capital so that New Zealanders, including retiring New Zealanders, can enjoy a secure and prosperous future.

Before KiwiSaver arrived on the scene, our savings record as a nation was poor.

And though KiwiSaver is growing at a phenomenal rate, the value of KiwiSaver funds is estimated to be about 9% of the value of managed funds investments according to Reserve Bank figures.

KiwiSaver therefore represents a growing but still relatively small percentage of the value of New Zealand's total managed funds under management.

The Government is of the view that more can be done and that for the stability of our economy and long term benefits, steps have to be taken now to improve our situation.

Working Groups have proven to be a highly effective tool that this government uses for the things that really matter by providing expert insight and advice.

We had the Tax Working Group whose advice was invaluable on the design of Budget 2010 and now recently launched we have the Savings Working Group.

The Savings Working Group is looking at:

*   The role of government savings as part of New Zealand's overall savings picture, including long-term savings/debt targets and the interaction of government and private savings.
*   The impact of the tax system on the level and composition of national savings and investment decisions.
*   The role of KiwiSaver in improving national savings.

The examination of the tax system's impact on savings will be far-ranging and will scrutinise some fundamental aspects of the system.

Already the Savings Working Group chairman, Kerry McDonald has commented that compulsory savings may not be the answer to fixing New Zealand's savings record.

He points out that although Australia has had compulsory saving over the past eighteen years, opinions are still divided over whether it has actually improved the national savings situation.

I look forward with considerable interest to receiving the Group's recommendations early next year.

#### Trans-Tasman portability

KiwiSaver is a major government initiative and we continue to refine and improve it.

In September this year, New Zealand enacted legislation bringing in new rules allowing New Zealanders and Australians to consolidate their financial affairs in the country in which they live.

Currently, Kiwis who work in Australia must contribute to an Australian complying superannuation fund.

However, those savings are locked into the Australian scheme until the saver reaches retirement age.

Trans-Tasman portability will allow retirement savings from Australian complying superannuation funds to be transferred into New Zealand KiwiSaver funds - and vice versa.

Participation in the super portability scheme will be voluntary.

While New Zealand has already enacted the necessary legislation, Australia has yet to do so, but we expect this to be in 2011.

Decisions on the administration of KiwiSaver affect you directly as did the introduction of Payroll Giving.

With such changes, you are required to make changes to your processes and your documentation and of course, so does Inland Revenue.

#### Transform IR

Last time I was invited to your conference, I shared with you some thoughts about how Inland Revenue conducts its business and how it could improve those processes.

Those of you who were here last time may remember that I spoke about the need to modernise Inland Revenue's systems, including the critically important PAYE system.

This is especially important at a time when the government is pushing to ensure that we get increasing value for money from the public service as a whole, at a time when every tax dollar counts.

As I have said many times now, it is staggering that for a population of a little over four million people, Inland Revenue sends out over half a million letters a week, and over 25 million letters a year.

Inland Revenue knows that it has to cut that mail dramatically.

I do not for a minute imagine that anyone here enjoys doing their tax returns, filing monthly schedules or any of the other requirements placed on you by the tax system.

And I appreciate that dealing with the paperwork for tax obligations may not be the highlight of your day.

So here is some good news.

Earlier this year, the Student Loan Scheme Bill passed its first reading in the House and is currently with the Select Committee.

This bill is of significance because it marks the first steps towards an environment where greater reliance is placed on online management of one's affairs and a reduction in the amount of paperwork.

This is the vision for all interaction with Inland Revenue as it moves increasingly away from paper.

I expect this legislation to be passed by Parliament next year, and the new arrangements for student loans, which will be more akin to electronic banking to be in place from April 2012.

Inland Revenue aims in the development and delivery of its services to be customer-focused, and that means that no undue compliance costs are placed on the taxpayer and that the process is as efficient as possible.

The paper-based system has worked well for most of the last 100 years, however I doubt that by my definition it can claim to be customer-focused any longer.

In an age where so many transactions; from buying airfares to groceries and conducting banking are all done online, it is time to find a better way.

It is also wasteful to retain the status quo.

Not just a waste of all the paper, but of all the time spent by Inland Revenue staff processing and transcribing information.

Time paid for by taxpayer dollars.

There is also your time too.

Unlike individuals, businesses already keep their financial information in a computer system.

So the question has been asked, "if businesses already hold all the information needed for their routine tax matters such as PAYE and GST in their computer files, would it not be cheaper, easier and less time consuming to simply connect direct to Inland Revenue's computer?

Businesses would also be able to access tax information such as account balances through their accounting software.

It is a novel thought and it raises all sorts of interesting possibilities as well as issues.

What about privacy and secrecy?

How do we keep taxpayers costs down?

What kind of software system would be able to do that?

Who would design such a thing?

Is this desirable for New Zealand businesses?

How can we implement it in a way which works best for businesses?

#### Software Developers' Working Group

In October I attended the first meeting of the Software Developers' Working Group.

This is a group of people from the software development industry who have expressed interest in tackling those and other questions as they look at different options and also consider the design of software that would help your business computing system connect directly to Inland Revenue's for routine tax compliance matters.

This includes the day-to-day matters such as starting and stopping an employee and processing their pay.

Inland Revenue is already working closely with the Working Group on detailed process design in areas such as these.

#### Future tax administration

Electronic communication is not the sole extent of the changes being explored.

I mentioned before that the Budget was designed with a set of principles in mind.

One of those was to deliver a better and smarter public service.

The service you get from the public service must be efficient and cost effective.

That challenge will require Inland Revenue to look afresh and its role and its interaction with its customers, and we are up to the task.

For instance, people currently use accountants for tax obligations and tax refund agents to get tax refunds, so why do we cling to the notion that Inland Revenue is solely responsible for providing tax services?

Why cannot others provide tax services too?

Under such a model, the Inland Revenue of the future would continue to be responsible for the integrity of the tax system and assume a role akin to that of a tax services wholesaler while others, playing to their own strengths would be retailers.

The scope for efficiency under such a model could be extensive.

You will be hearing much more about these types of ideas as work progresses in this area.

However, whatever the future of the tax administration, some aspects of the system will remain constant.

Integrity will remain at the heart of the tax system and the tax administration will need to ensure it works with taxpayers, employers and the community to maintain the integrity of the system to ensure fairness.

Part of that will be working to ensure understanding of tax obligations to promote compliance.

#### Employer education

For people entering into business for the first time, the detail of what is required to meet tax obligations can seem a little daunting.

It is part of Inland Revenue's role to ensure that everyone understands their tax obligations sufficiently to be able to fulfil them.

This includes the full range of employer responsibilities including PAYE, ACC, KiwiSaver and Student Loans.

In my role as Minister of Revenue, I come into contact with Inland Revenue people who work with employers to help them understand and comply with their tax obligations.

For new and existing employers the department runs regular seminars and workshops covering employer obligations.

This strikes me as an excellent initiative and I recommend that new and even existing employers look into these.

Anything that could save you getting into difficulties later on has got to be worth it.

Where employers appear to be having difficulties meeting their obligations, the department will make efforts to make contact as early as possible enabling them get back on track quickly.

The implications for employees where an employer has not met their tax obligations can be significant, so it is crucial to correct that course swiftly.

This is also a reason why Inland Revenue has a strong focus on enabling customers get it right.

#### Conclusion

The tax system continues to evolve and adapt to meet the needs of society.

Over the years Student Loans, KiwiSaver and Payroll Giving have been added to the system.

All these have added to your workload.

Technology has moved on but the tax system has not.

Now changes are now proposed to the tax administration and could mean greater reliance on the internet and even a change to the way the tax system is administered.

These changes are positive and will directly affect you, making things easier to do.

What will not change is that Inland Revenue will continue to protect the integrity of the tax system to ensure fairness.

I thank you for your work and I thank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak to you.

I hope your conference is enjoyable and productive.

Ends.

**e-Payments** – Allow Inland Revenue to accept payments via credit card over the internet.

**Legislative changes to improve debt collection** – Funding was received through Budget 2010 to improve the collection of debt and this will require policy changes to make operational.

### OTHER KEY INITIATIVES

**Child Support** – Continue work on the better recognition of shared care in the child support formula and improving payment of child support.

**Disputes** – Administrative and legislative changes to improve the disputes process and ensure that the process works more efficiently. These changes are aimed at addressing a submission from the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and the New Zealand Law Society that set out a wide range of concerns with the dispute resolution and challenge procedures.

**Gift Duty** – Abolish Gift Duty if concerns about creditor protection and social assistance targeting can be addressed.

**GST measures – various** – This includes items in the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill 2010, such as nominations, accommodation and apportionment rules. The GST phoenix schemes (zero rating of land) are also part of this bill but are separately dealt with above.

**Mutual recognition (should it be advanced)** – Mutual recognition of trans-Tasman imputation credits with both New Zealand and Australia recognising for imputation purposes company tax paid in the other jurisdiction.

### NON-DISCRETIONARY WORK

**Servicing Ministers** – Dealing with issues as they are raised by Ministers.

**Support for other policy areas and agencies** – This work involves input on tax issues that arise out of non-tax government priorities (for example, tax issues arising from private/public partnerships, review of the Charities Act 2005 and potential tax incentives for the arts sector arising out of the Philanthropy and Arts Taskforce).

**Remedial work** – There are a number of areas that require remedial changes to effectively implement existing policy. The areas include GST, provisional tax pooling, IFRS, UOMI deductibility (to reflect current practice) and life insurance (transition from old life rules to new rules – enacted October 2009).

**Managing bills in Parliament**, including in 2010 –

Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill 2010

Student Loan Scheme Bill 2010

Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Bill 2010

Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Bill 2010

### OTHER WORK

**Amortisation of capital raising costs** – This project would allow deductibility over time for the costs of a business raising capital. It was a recommendation of the Capital Markets Development Taskforce to allow deductibility for equity-raising expenses over the lesser of the life of the instrument or twenty years.

**GST cross-border issues** – The project reviews the GST treatment of business activities that are in substance exports but do not qualify for zero-rating since there is no tangible export.

**Hybrids and thin capitalisation** – Hybrid instruments are partly debt and partly equity. The project provides a framework for the tax treatment of hybrids, exploring trade-offs between integrity, protecting the revenue base, and reducing the cost of capital for non-resident investment. The project will also examine the ordinary thin capitalisation limits in order to maintain the New Zealand tax base.

**Imputation (subject to Australian response on mutual recognition)** – This project is to review the current rules on the use of imputation credits and whether companies should be able to stream imputation credits. The review also covers refundability of unused imputation credits, particularly to charities.

**Valuation of livestock** – Review of the ability to move from one livestock valuation method to another and, in particular, exits from the herd scheme.

**Profit distribution plans (PDPs)** – The Government announced on 16 April 2009 that it intends to clarify the law to ensure that bonus issues of shares distributed under PDPs are taxed in the same way as shares issued under other dividend reinvestment plans. A consultative document was issued on 25 June 2009.

**Non-resident investors in portfolio investment entities (PIEs)** – This project considers tax relief for non-resident PIE investors on foreign-sourced PIE income. It is considered that the imposition of tax in this situation is potentially acting as a barrier to the development of New Zealand’s fund management industry since it discourages non-residents from investing outside New Zealand via PIEs.

**Charities – Schedule 32: Donee status for overseas-based organisations** – This project includes reviewing the current Cabinet criteria and processes concerning legislating for an overseas-based organisation to be a donee organisation.

**Further charitable work** – There are a number of additional issues under consideration in the charitable sector area, including gift aid, payroll giving intermediaries and cultural giving.

Media statement

### Tax changes will increase fairness

Proposed new tax rules, released today, will increase the integrity of the tax system and help ensure everyone pays their fair share, Finance Minister Bill English and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne say.

Mr Dunne today released a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) that will introduce several Budget 2010 tax measures to the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill, which is nearing its final stages in Parliament. MPs are expected to debate the amendments on Thursday.

The proposed changes, which have been finalised after public consultation over the past few months, will:

*   Broaden the definition of income for Working for Families, Student Allowance and the Community Services Card to help prevent people structuring their income to inflate their entitlements.
*   Close loopholes in the tax treatment of loss attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs) so shareholders can no longer claim losses against their personal income.
*   Ensure people can still claim accelerated depreciation on the fit-out of commercial and industrial buildings. They will also be able to claim the depreciation loading on assets where investment decisions were made before 20 May 2010, but not completed until sometime after.

Mr English says the changes increase fairness and consistency.

"These changes will reduce the opportunities for well-off people to structure their affairs for tax purposes," Mr English says.

"Sheltering income to inflate Working for Families or Student Allowance payments is unfair to people in genuine need and to the taxpaying public which foots the bill for these assistance programmes. This change is expected to reduce spending on Working for Families tax credits by $32 million a year.

Mr Dunne says the changes will apply to Working for Families and the Community Services Card from 1 April, 2011. The Student Allowance changes will apply once an Order in Council is made.

"The broader definition of income for social assistance will include income from family trusts, some fringe benefits in certain circumstances, income from a cash PIE that is not locked in and income from a spouse living overseas," Mr Dunne says.

"Changes to the treatment of QCs and LAQCs will ensure that owners cannot claim a tax deduction on losses at a higher rate than they pay on profits.

"Since Budget night there has been considerable consultation on the implementation details of the tax measures announced and I believe the changes outlined today are a fair and pragmatic response," Mr Dunne says.

Other changes in the SOP lower the tax rates for Maori Authorities and the personal income tax rates for non-resident seasonal workers in line with the lower personal tax rates announced in the Budget.

Fact sheets on the SOP changes are available at: www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz

The changes are part of the second stage of the Government's Budget 2010 tax package and follow the 1 October tax cuts and GST increase. Once the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill is passed the tax measures that will take effect from 1 April 2011 (or the 2011/12 income year) include:

*   A cut in the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 28 per cent.
*   A cut in the tax rate faced by unit trusts, life insurance policyholders and some other savings vehicles from 30 per cent to 28 per cent.
*   Ending landlords' and businesses' ability to claim depreciation on buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more.
*   Tightening the rules for LAQCs and QCs so shareholders cannot deduct losses at their marginal tax rate and pay tax on profits at the lower company rate.
*   Changes to the thin capitalisation tax rules to limit the scope for foreign multinationals to reduce their New Zealand tax liability.
*   Tightening the definition of income for Working for Families, Student Allowance and the Community Services Card.
*   Ending the automatic CPI indexation of the Working for Families abatement threshold to stop higher-income recipients getting bigger increases than those on lower incomes.
*   An increase in IRD audit and compliance activity to improve the integrity of the tax system.

### Fact sheet – Improving the integrity of social assistance programmes

**Improving integrity of Working for Families and other social assistance programmes**

The changes described below follow the Government’s announcement in Budget 2010 to improve the integrity of certain social assistance programmes, namely Working for Families (WFF), Student Allowances and the Community Services Card.

The changes are intended to counter people structuring their affairs to inflate their entitlements. This will prevent people exploiting gaps in the current definition of family income.

The changes will ensure the rules achieve their original intention of targeting assistance to people in genuine need rather than providing it to people with sufficient means.

As a first step to addressing integrity concerns around social assistance programmes, the Government excluded investment losses such as rental losses for the purpose of determining WFF tax credits. This was included in the Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010.

The move to recognise different sources of income and exclude investment losses for WFF will reduce tax credit spending by $32 million a year from  
2011–12.

Further changes will apply to WFF tax credits and the Community Services Card from 1 April 2011. The changes to the Student Allowances parental income definition will be made separately by Order in Council.

The changes outlined below refer to the definition of income for WFF tax credits. The Community Services Card and the parental income test for student allowances use the same definition of income. Therefore, any changes to this definition of income will also apply to these two other types of social assistance.

**Trustee income**

Family income for WFF already includes beneficiary income of a trust but does not include distributions of trustee income. Large amounts of trustee income can be distributed to a family to live on without affecting their WFF entitlements. Changes are being made to the way trustee income is treated to reflect the actual level of income a family has available to them. This includes the income from trust-owned companies.

*   A trust-owned company will be defined as a company in which the trustees and their associates hold 50% or more of the voting interests (or market value interests).
*   Trustee income will be attributed to a settlor of the trust. Trustee income will be the net income of a trust (less income distributed as beneficiary income) and the net income of trust-owned companies (less dividends from such companies).
*   To avoid over-reach of this rule, the settlor for WFF purposes will exclude anyone who provides personal services for free for a trust’s administration or the maintenance of the trust’s property.
*   If there is more than one settlor for a trust, the trustee income will be attributed to the settlors of the trust proportionally. However, if a settlor arranges for friends or relatives to be settlors to artificially dilute the attribution rule, the original settlor will be treated as the sole settlor of the trust. This is a result of the existing settlor definition (including nominee look-through rule) and anti-avoidance rule.
*   Some trusts such as charitable trusts will be specifically excluded. Income from these trusts will not be attributed to the settlor for WFF purposes.

**Fringe benefits**

*   Currently, fringe benefits are not included as income when determining WFF entitlements. In some circumstances, people can arrange a proportion of their remuneration to be paid as fringe benefits instead of wages, lowering income for WFF purposes. This may happen when the employee exercises control over the make-up of their remuneration.
*   Significant fringe benefits that are easily substitutable for cash, such as motor vehicles or low-interest employee loans, will be counted as family income.
*   This rule will apply only to shareholder-employees. A person will be a shareholder-employee of a company if they, together with associates, hold 50% or more of the shares in the company.

**Passive income of children**

Large amounts of income can be allocated to children via family trusts and companies or by investments being placed directly under their names, artificially lowering parents’ income for WFF purposes.

*   Under the new rules, any passive income over $500 per child per year will be counted as family income.
*   Passive income for WFF purposes will include interest, dividends, royalties, rents, and a taxable Māori Authority distribution other than a retirement scheme contribution.
*   Passive income will also include beneficiary income from a trust but will exclude certain types of income received such as income from certain testamentary trusts (consistent with the minor beneficiary rule).
*   Wages of children will not be counted as family income.

**Unlocked portfolio investment entities**

*   Income from unlocked portfolio investment entities (PIEs), that are easily accessible (such as cash PIEs), will be counted as family income because such income is akin to interest earned on bank accounts which are currently counted.
*   Unlocked PIEs will be defined as all PIEs other than superannuation schemes that are registered with the Government Actuary, such as KiwiSaver schemes or retirement savings schemes. These schemes are excluded on the basis that the income is sufficiently locked-in until a person’s retirement.

**Income of non-resident spouse**

*   A person might live in New Zealand with their child while their spouse lives and works overseas. Because the non-resident spouse’s world-wide income is available to meet the family’s living expenses it will be counted as family income.

**Tax-exempt salary and wages**

*   Tax-exempt salary and wages of people under specific international agreements will be counted as family income. Such salary and wages are available to meet the family’s living expenses.
*   An example would be salaries received by employees of international organisations such as the United Nations or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

**Main income equalisation scheme deposits**

The main income equalisation scheme is intended to allow persons carrying on an agricultural, fishing or forestry business to smooth their income for tax purposes to address large fluctuations of income over several years. A deposit to a main income equalisation account, which is allowed as a deduction, lowers their taxable income and currently also lowers income for WFF purposes.

*   Deposits entered in a person’s main income equalisation account will now be counted as family income. To prevent double counting, refunds (excluding interest) from these accounts will not be counted.

**Private pensions and annuities**

*   50% of non-taxable private pensions and annuities will be included in family income.

**Other payments**

*   A family may be receiving payments other than those already included in the definition of family income and that are used to meet the family’s living expenses. These will also be counted, unless otherwise stated, if the total exceeds $5,000 a year. Examples of such other payments include distributions of trustee income from family trusts where the person is not the settlor of the trust and regular cash payments from family members.

* * *

### Fact sheet – Changes to the qualifying company rules

The Government announced in Budget 2010 that the qualifying company rules would be amended. A new transparent form of tax treatment would be introduced to ensure that shareholders who use a company’s losses also pay tax on any company profit at their marginal tax rate.

The changes introduced today:

*   change the tax treatment of loss attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs) so shareholders can no longer claim losses against their personal income. This will prevent these shareholders being able to claim losses at their higher marginal tax rate and profits at the company tax rate;
*   allow existing qualifying companies (QCs) and LAQCs to continue to use the current rules without the ability to attribute losses, pending a review of the dividend rules for closely held companies;
*   provide look-through income tax treatment for electing closely-held companies.
*   allow QCs and LAQCs to transition into a new look-through company (LTC) vehicle or change to another business vehicle such as a partnership, without a tax cost during the period 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2013.

**Look-through companies**

_**What does “look-through” mean?**_

*   “Look-through” effectively means that we ignore the company, which is the legal entity carrying on a business, and tax its shareholders on the company’s profits instead. It also means that shareholders can use a company’s losses against their other income, subject to the loss limitation rule.
*   Look-through treatment applies for income tax purposes only. An LTC retains its corporate obligations and benefits, such as limited liability, under general company law.
*   An LTC’s income, expenses, tax credits, rebates, gains and losses are passed on to its owners. These items are allocated to each person in proportion to the number of shares they have in the LTC.
*   The income of an LTC is taxed and expenses are deducted as if each owner had received that income and incurred the expenses personally. Any profit is taxed at the owner’s marginal tax rate. The owner can use any losses against their other income, subject to the loss limitation rule.
*   The LTC loss limitation rule is similar to that for limited partnerships. This means owners can offset tax losses only to the extent the losses reflect their economic loss. Any loss that cannot be used is carried forward and may be claimed in future years, subject to the application of the loss limitation rule in those years. There are certain rules about the use of these losses if the LTC ceases to be an LTC, or if the owner sells their shares.
*   An LTC is still recognised separately from its shareholders for certain other tax purposes, including GST, PAYE, and certain administrative or other withholding tax purposes under the Income Tax Act.

_**What sort of company can use the LTC rules?**_

*   The rules are designed for closely held companies which are resident in New Zealand.
*   An LTC must have five or fewer “look-through counted owners”. Related shareholders may be treated as a single owner for the purposes of this test – for example, if a mother and daughter both hold shares in an LTC they are treated as “one” owner. There are special rules for determining who counts as an owner when shares are held by trustees.
*   Only a natural person, trustee or another LTC may hold shares in an LTC. All the company’s shares must be of the same class and provide the same rights and obligations to each shareholder.

_**How does a company become an LTC?**_

*   All owners must elect for a closely held company to become an LTC. Once a company becomes an LTC it will remain in the LTC rules unless one of the owners decides to opt out, or if it ceases to be eligible – for example, by having more than five counted owners.
*   LTC election forms will be available early next year from Inland Revenue. In the interim companies can elect just by writing to Inland Revenue with details and signatures from all their shareholders, and details of the shareholding of each.
*   Elections should be received before the start of the income year to which they apply. However for the next two income years (starting from 1 April 2011), existing QCs and LAQCs have a six-month extension period to decide whether to transition to the LTC rules (see “**Existing QCs and LAQCs**” below).

_**What happens when an owner sells their shares in the LTC?**_

*   Owners of an LTC are treated as holding LTC property directly, in proportion to their shareholding. When owners sell their shares they are treated as disposing of their share of the underlying LTC property. If this includes, for example, revenue account property or recovery of depreciation, the shareholder may have to pay any tax associated with the disposal. Tax will only be due if the disposal amounts are above certain thresholds.
*   If the company stops using the LTC rules or if the company ceases to exist there will be a deemed disposal and acquisition of the company’s property at market value. This may mean the shareholders have to pay tax on any income arising from the deemed disposal.

**Existing QCs and LAQCs**

Existing QCs and LAQCs have several options to choose from in one of the first two income years starting on or after 1 April 2011; the year they choose is called the “transitional year”. These rules apply only to companies that are already QCs or LAQCs in the 2010–11 income year.

They can continue to use the QC rules. Or if they choose to leave the QC rules, they can have a smooth transition into the LTC rules or they can choose to change their business structure into a partnership, limited partnership or a sole trade, with no tax cost.

The QC or LAQC can:

*   Continue as a QC, without the ability to attribute losses. The QC rules are otherwise unchanged.
    *     
        This will be the “default” option for all existing QCs and LAQCs.
    *   An LAQC will no longer be able to attribute losses to shareholders.
    *   Income will be taxed at the company level, and only dividends with imputation credits attached will be taxable to shareholders.
    *   Capital gains can be distributed tax-free without winding up the company.
*   Choose to be taxed as an ordinary company.
    *     
        The QC or LAQC election must be revoked.
    *   Any losses must be used by the company, not the shareholders.
    *   All dividends will be taxable to shareholders, although imputation credits may be attached.
*   Choose to be taxed as a look-through company (LTC).
    *     
        Existing QCs and LAQCs have six months from the start of their transitional year to elect to become an LTC.
    *   Look-through treatment will apply from the start of the transitional year.
*   Transition to become a limited partnership, an ordinary partnership, or sole trade.
    *     
        Owners of existing QCs and LAQCs have up to six months from the start of their transitional year to tell Inland Revenue that they will restructure their business into a limited partnership, an ordinary partnership, or become a sole trader.
    *   The partnership or sole trade must consist of the same person(s) who owned the QC or LAQC.
    *   The transition into the new business form must be completed by the end of the transitional year.

* * *

### Fact sheet – Post-budget changes to tax depreciation rules

Budget 2010 removed depreciation deductions for most buildings from the start of the 2011–12 income year. At the same time the Government announced a review of the tax treatment of commercial building fit-outs to ensure that depreciation allowances apply to commercial and industrial building fit-outs.

*   Following this review, the bill introduces new rules to ensure that the fit-out of commercial and industrial buildings will continue to be depreciable.
*   Budget 2010 also removed depreciation loading for assets purchased after 20 May 2010. The bill makes technical changes to these rules to ensure that depreciation loading still applies to assets where investment decisions were made before 20 May 2010 but not completed until sometime after.

**Commercial fit-outs depreciable**

*   The law will be clarified so that commercial and industrial fit-out remains depreciable property.
*   The law relating to residential fit-outs will remain unchanged. Residential fit-out is generally non-depreciable as set out in the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s Interpretation Statement IS10/01.
*   Items of fit-out that are shared between commercial and residential purposes – for example, lifts, electrical cabling, fire protection, sewerage and water reticulation in a mixed-purpose building will be depreciable if the dominant purpose of the building is commercial. Fit-out used only for commercial purposes will be depreciable property.
*   The new rules recognise that there are commercial buildings that provide residential-type accommodation by excluding a number of these types of buildings from the meaning of “dwelling”. This will ensure that fit-outs associated with these buildings will continue to be depreciable. The types of buildings that will be specifically excluded from the meaning of “dwelling” are:
    *     
        hospitals;
    *   hotels, motels, inns, hostels, or boarding houses;
    *   certain serviced apartments;
    *   convalescent homes, nursing homes, or hospices;
    *   rest homes or retirement villages, from hospital care through to residential care facilities; and
    *   camping grounds.
*   A new rule will allow commercial building owners, who did not itemise building fit-out separately from the building at the time of acquisition, to amortise up to 15% of the building’s adjusted tax book value at 2% straight-line per year until the building is disposed of.

**Depreciation loading**

Depreciation loading was removed on a prospective basis as part of Budget 2010. Loading continues to apply in respect of assets purchased or constructed before 20 May 2010 or when there was a commitment to purchase or construct an asset on or before 20 May 2010. While the existing legislation that gave effect to this grandparenting worked in most situations, its result was unclear in others.

*   Under the new rules an asset will be eligible for depreciation loading if:
    *     
        it is acquired on or before 20 May 2010; or
    *   there was a decision to purchase or construct it and its owner either:  
        \- entered into a binding contract for its purchase or construction on or before 20 May 2010; or  
        \- incurred expenditure in relation to it on or before 20 May 2010.
*   The first part of this rule will cover assets that were clearly purchased on or before 20 May 2010. The second part will cover situations when there was a clear commitment to purchase an asset, but when the purchasing process was incomplete or, for an asset under construction, when the asset was not yet built.
*   Evidence of a decision to purchase or construct an asset can be provided through documents that conclusively show such a decision had been made. Alternatively, a decision can be evidenced through a statutory declaration sent to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue that states that a decision had been made.

* * *

### Fact sheet – Change to the Māori Authority tax rate

**Tax rate change**

Māori Authorities are taxed as a proxy for their members. They are currently taxed at 19.5%, which was the statutory tax rate for the majority of Māori Authority members when the current rules were introduced. As a result of changes to personal marginal tax rates in Budget 2010, the Māori Authority tax rate will drop to 17.5% to align it with the individual marginal rate of the majority of Māori Authority members. The change will apply from the 2011–12 income year, the same effective date as the company tax rate decrease.

**Transitional issues**

Consequential amendments are being introduced to accompany the rate change. These are similar to those introduced for companies as a result of the lowering of the company tax rate in Budget 2010. They are:

*   _“Grandparenting” imputation ratios_ – When the Māori Authority tax rate is lowered, this will automatically adjust the ratio at which a Māori Authority can attach Māori Authority tax credits to distributions. The result is that pre-rate change credits can be “trapped” in the Māori Authority, leading to effective double taxation when the relevant income is distributed. A “grandparenting” period of two years is being introduced to allow Māori Authorities an opportunity to review their credit accounts and make distributions of pre-rate change profits at the existing credit ratio if they wish.
*   _Provisional tax adjustments_ – An adjustment is being made to the provisional tax rules so that the new rate is immediately reflected in the tax paid by Māori Authority provisional taxpayers. This recognises the fact that, all other things being equal, the tax paid is expected to be less in the year of the decrease. For Māori Authorities that base their provisional tax on an earlier year’s tax obligations, this will be achieved by amending the uplift factor used to calculate their current year liability. Provisional taxpayers that actually estimate their liability will be unaffected by these changes, as they would factor the lower rate into their estimates.

### Fact sheet – Tax rate change for non-resident seasonal workers

**Improving accuracy of non-resident seasonal workers tax rate**

*   The personal tax rate that applies to non-resident seasonal workers is being changed to 10.5% and will apply from 1 April 2011. The new rate better reflects the income levels earned by these workers while working in New Zealand, particularly since personal tax rates were lowered in Budget 2010. The previous rate was 15%.
*   The non-resident seasonal worker tax rate is used by workers employed from Pacific Island nations under the Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme. The scheme is administered by the Department of Labour.
*   The non-resident seasonal worker rate is a flat rate of tax which reflects the average tax rate faced by these workers on their New Zealand-sourced income according to the personal tax rate scale.
*   Recent data shows that 80% of non-resident seasonal workers have New Zealand income of less than $14,000. This indicates that the rate should now be set at the lowest marginal rate of 10.5%.
*   The tax rate change will take effect from 1 April 2011
1 December 2010 Fact sheet – Improving the integrity of social assistance programmes Improving integrity of Working for Families and other social assistance programmes The changes described below follow the Government’s announcement in Budget 2010 to improve the integrity of certain social assistance programmes, namely Working for Families (WFF), Student Allowances and the Community Services Card. The changes are intended to counter people structuring their affairs to inflate their entitlements. This will prevent people exploiting gaps in the current definition of family income. The changes will ensure the rules achieve their original intention of targeting assistance to people in genuine need rather than providing it to people with sufficient means. As a first step to addressing integrity concerns around social assistance programmes, the Government excluded investment losses such as rental losses for the purpose of determining WFF tax credits. This was included in the Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010. The move to recognise different sources of income and exclude investment losses for WFF will reduce tax credit spending by $32 million a year from 2011–12. Further changes will apply to WFF tax credits and the Community Services Card from 1 April 2011. The changes to the Student Allowances parental income definition will be made separately by Order in Council. 2 The changes outlined below refer to the definition of income for WFF tax credits. The Community Services Card and the parental income test for student allowances use the same definition of income. Therefore, any changes to this definition of income will also apply to these two other types of social assistance. Trustee income Family income for WFF already includes beneficiary income of a trust but does not include distributions of trustee income. Large amounts of trustee income can be distributed to a family to live on without affecting their WFF entitlements. Changes are being made to the way trustee income is treated to reflect the actual level of income a family has available to them. This includes the income from trust-owned companies. • A trust-owned company will be defined as a company in which the trustees and their associates hold 50% or more of the voting interests (or market value interests). • Trustee income will be attributed to a settlor of the trust. Trustee income will be the net income of a trust (less income distributed as beneficiary income) and the net income of trust-owned companies (less dividends from such companies). • To avoid over-reach of this rule, the settlor for WFF purposes will exclude anyone who provides personal services for free for a trust’s administration or the maintenance of the trust’s property. • If there is more than one settlor for a trust, the trustee income will be attributed to the settlors of the trust proportionally. However, if a settlor arranges for friends or relatives to be settlors to artificially dilute the attribution rule, the original settlor will be treated as the sole settlor of the trust. This is a result of the existing settlor definition (including nominee look-through rule) and anti-avoidance rule. • Some trusts such as charitable trusts will be specifically excluded. Income from these trusts will not be attributed to the settlor for WFF purposes. Fringe benefits • Currently, fringe benefits are not included as income when determining WFF entitlements. In some circumstances, people can arrange a proportion of their remuneration to be paid as fringe benefits instead of wages, lowering income for WFF purposes. This may happen when the employee exercises control over the make-up of their remuneration. 3 • Significant fringe benefits that are easily substitutable for cash, such as motor vehicles or low-interest employee loans, will be counted as family income. • This rule will apply only to shareholder-employees. A person will be a shareholder-employee of a company if they, together with associates, hold 50% or more of the shares in the company. Passive income of children Large amounts of income can be allocated to children via family trusts and companies or by investments being placed directly under their names, artificially lowering parents’ income for WFF purposes. • Under the new rules, any passive income over $500 per child per year will be counted as family income. • Passive income for WFF purposes will include interest, dividends, royalties, rents, and a taxable Māori Authority distribution other than a retirement scheme contribution. • Passive income will also include beneficiary income from a trust but will exclude certain types of income received such as income from certain testamentary trusts (consistent with the minor beneficiary rule). • Wages of children will not be counted as family income. Unlocked portfolio investment entities • Income from unlocked portfolio investment entities (PIEs), that are easily accessible (such as cash PIEs), will be counted as family income because such income is akin to interest earned on bank accounts which are currently counted. • Unlocked PIEs will be defined as all PIEs other than superannuation schemes that are registered with the Government Actuary, such as KiwiSaver schemes or retirement savings schemes. These schemes are excluded on the basis that the income is sufficiently locked-in until a person’s retirement. Income of non-resident spouse • A person might live in New Zealand with their child while their spouse lives and works overseas. Because the non-resident spouse’s world-wide income is available to meet the family’s living expenses it will be counted as family income. 4 Tax-exempt salary and wages • Tax-exempt salary and wages of people under specific international agreements will be counted as family income. Such salary and wages are available to meet the family’s living expenses. • An example would be salaries received by employees of international organisations such as the United Nations or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Main income equalisation scheme deposits The main income equalisation scheme is intended to allow persons carrying on an agricultural, fishing or forestry business to smooth their income for tax purposes to address large fluctuations of income over several years. A deposit to a main income equalisation account, which is allowed as a deduction, lowers their taxable income and currently also lowers income for WFF purposes. • Deposits entered in a person’s main income equalisation account will now be counted as family income. To prevent double counting, refunds (excluding interest) from these accounts will not be counted. Private pensions and annuities • 50% of non-taxable private pensions and annuities will be included in family income. Other payments • A family may be receiving payments other than those already included in the definition of family income and that are used to meet the family’s living expenses. These will also be counted, unless otherwise stated, if the total exceeds $5,000 a year. Examples of such other payments include distributions of trustee income from family trusts where the person is not the settlor of the trust and regular cash payments from family members.
1 December 2010 Fact sheet – Changes to the qualifying company rules The Government announced in Budget 2010 that the qualifying company rules would be amended. A new transparent form of tax treatment would be introduced to ensure that shareholders who use a company’s losses also pay tax on any company profit at their marginal tax rate. The changes introduced today: • change the tax treatment of loss attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs) so shareholders can no longer claim losses against their personal income. This will prevent these shareholders being able to claim losses at their higher marginal tax rate and profits at the company tax rate; • allow existing qualifying companies (QCs) and LAQCs to continue to use the current rules without the ability to attribute losses, pending a review of the dividend rules for closely held companies; • provide look-through income tax treatment for electing closely-held companies. • allow QCs and LAQCs to transition into a new look-through company (LTC) vehicle or change to another business vehicle such as a partnership, without a tax cost during the period 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2013. Look-through companies What does “look-through” mean? • “Look-through” effectively means that we ignore the company, which is the legal entity carrying on a business, and tax its shareholders on the company’s profits instead. It also means that shareholders can use a company’s losses against their other income, subject to the loss limitation rule. • Look-through treatment applies for income tax purposes only. An LTC retains its corporate obligations and benefits, such as limited liability, under general company law. • An LTC’s income, expenses, tax credits, rebates, gains and losses are passed on to its owners. These items are allocated to each person in proportion to the number of shares they have in the LTC. 2 • The income of an LTC is taxed and expenses are deducted as if each owner had received that income and incurred the expenses personally. Any profit is taxed at the owner’s marginal tax rate. The owner can use any losses against their other income, subject to the loss limitation rule. • The LTC loss limitation rule is similar to that for limited partnerships. This means owners can offset tax losses only to the extent the losses reflect their economic loss. Any loss that cannot be used is carried forward and may be claimed in future years, subject to the application of the loss limitation rule in those years. There are certain rules about the use of these losses if the LTC ceases to be an LTC, or if the owner sells their shares. • An LTC is still recognised separately from its shareholders for certain other tax purposes, including GST, PAYE, and certain administrative or other withholding tax purposes under the Income Tax Act. What sort of company can use the LTC rules? • The rules are designed for closely held companies which are resident in New Zealand. • An LTC must have five or fewer “look-through counted owners”. Related shareholders may be treated as a single owner for the purposes of this test – for example, if a mother and daughter both hold shares in an LTC they are treated as “one” owner. There are special rules for determining who counts as an owner when shares are held by trustees. • Only a natural person, trustee or another LTC may hold shares in an LTC. All the company’s shares must be of the same class and provide the same rights and obligations to each shareholder. How does a company become an LTC? • All owners must elect for a closely held company to become an LTC. Once a company becomes an LTC it will remain in the LTC rules unless one of the owners decides to opt out, or if it ceases to be eligible – for example, by having more than five counted owners. • LTC election forms will be available early next year from Inland Revenue. In the interim companies can elect just by writing to Inland Revenue with details and signatures from all their shareholders, and details of the shareholding of each. • Elections should be received before the start of the income year to which they apply. However for the next two income years (starting from 1 April 2011), existing QCs and LAQCs have a six-month extension period to decide whether to transition to the LTC rules (see “Existing QCs and LAQCs” below). 3 What happens when an owner sells their shares in the LTC? • Owners of an LTC are treated as holding LTC property directly, in proportion to their shareholding. When owners sell their shares they are treated as disposing of their share of the underlying LTC property. If this includes, for example, revenue account property or recovery of depreciation, the shareholder may have to pay any tax associated with the disposal. Tax will only be due if the disposal amounts are above certain thresholds. • If the company stops using the LTC rules or if the company ceases to exist there will be a deemed disposal and acquisition of the company’s property at market value. This may mean the shareholders have to pay tax on any income arising from the deemed disposal. Existing QCs and LAQCs Existing QCs and LAQCs have several options to choose from in one of the first two income years starting on or after 1 April 2011; the year they choose is called the “transitional year”. These rules apply only to companies that are already QCs or LAQCs in the 2010–11 income year. They can continue to use the QC rules. Or if they choose to leave the QC rules, they can have a smooth transition into the LTC rules or they can choose to change their business structure into a partnership, limited partnership or a sole trade, with no tax cost. The QC or LAQC can: • Continue as a QC, without the ability to attribute losses. The QC rules are otherwise unchanged. – This will be the “default” option for all existing QCs and LAQCs. – An LAQC will no longer be able to attribute losses to shareholders. – Income will be taxed at the company level, and only dividends with imputation credits attached will be taxable to shareholders. – Capital gains can be distributed tax-free without winding up the company. • Choose to be taxed as an ordinary company. – The QC or LAQC election must be revoked. – Any losses must be used by the company, not the shareholders. – All dividends will be taxable to shareholders, although imputation credits may be attached. 4 • Choose to be taxed as a look-through company (LTC). – Existing QCs and LAQCs have six months from the start of their transitional year to elect to become an LTC. – Look-through treatment will apply from the start of the transitional year. • Transition to become a limited partnership, an ordinary partnership, or sole trade. – Owners of existing QCs and LAQCs have up to six months from the start of their transitional year to tell Inland Revenue that they will restructure their business into a limited partnership, an ordinary partnership, or become a sole trader. – The partnership or sole trade must consist of the same person(s) who owned the QC or LAQC. – The transition into the new business form must be completed by the end of the transitional year.

### Address to the New Zealand Papua New Guinea Business Council  
The Northern Club, Auckland  
Wednesday, 15 December 2010

Good afternoon and thank you for inviting me to be here with you today.

When your Chairman, Stephen Eagles invited me to speak today, he reminded me of our first meeting in Manchester back in 1994.

At the time Stephen was contemplating a move to New Zealand.

He tells me that I promoted New Zealand to him as a country with an economy with firm foundations based on long-sighted policies.

I am pleased to have been so influential.

Sixteen years ago, Stephen and I sat and discussed the economic prospects of New Zealand.

Today, here we are again, discussing the economic prospects of another country; Papua New Guinea.

When he asked me to speak today, Stephen was especially keen to hear my views on negotiating a tax treaty (otherwise known as a double tax agreement, or DTA) with Papua New Guinea.

**International tax reform**

Harking back to my conversation with Stephen in 1994, the truth is that New Zealand is a good place to do business and government policy seeks to continually improve on that by reducing the tax burden placed on businesses and investors where possible.

We have, I think, made great strides in Budget 2010, which sought to rebalance the economy with lower personal tax rates as well as a lower company tax rate, while raising GST to encourage savings and removing depreciation on most buildings to encourage more prudent investment decisions.

On the international front we need to continue our focus on ensuring that our tax rules are internationally competitive and, where it is sensible, that our rules on the taxation of offshore investment are in line with international norms.

Over the past three years, our international tax rules have been progressively reformed.

In 2007, new rules for the treatment of offshore portfolio investments were introduced.

This standardised the taxation of nearly all such investments, removing distinctions between income and capital gains and eliminating a significant bias towards investment in certain overseas equities.

Then in 2009 the tax treatment of controlling investments in foreign companies was overhauled.

This represented a major change because for almost two decades New Zealand had comprehensively all investment income, regardless of source.

Last year, we joined most of the result of the world and moved to a tax exemption for 'active' income such as income from manufacturing or distribution activities.

This brought New Zealand into line with other OECD countries and lowered barriers to the global expansion of New Zealand-based businesses.

Legislation is currently being considered which continues those reforms.

The Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Bill, introduced in October, proposes extending the active income exemption from controlling investments to non-controlling but significant investments, known as non-portfolio foreign investment funds.

More work is planned for 2011, beginning with a review of the taxation of offshore branches of New Zealand companies but the key planks of our new international tax framework are already in place, and helping New Zealand-based businesses to compete more effectively overseas.

At a governmental level, and of particular importance to you, New Zealand's tax system has two key tools for working with tax jurisdictions abroad - the tax information exchange agreement and the double tax agreement.

Tax information exchange agreements are bilateral international treaties that allow tax authorities in the participating countries to exchange information on civil and criminal matters and are an important benchmark for offshore financial centres in meeting OECD standards for transparency and the exchange of information.

Double tax agreements are quite a different proposition.

**DTAs**

The negotiation of double tax agreements has been a significant part of New Zealand's tax policy work programme for some time.

Double tax agreements help New Zealand-based businesses compete abroad and help make New Zealand a more attractive place to invest in.

Because they operate by reducing tax impediments to cross-border income-earning activity, double tax agreements tend to be viewed favourably by New Zealand business and indeed by taxpayers at large.

I am therefore often asked by the New Zealand business community, not unreasonably, why New Zealand does not have a larger double tax agreement network.

In response to the question, I usually note that New Zealand's network of double tax agreements is respectable by world standards.

We currently have 35 double tax agreements in force, covering the majority of our major trading and investment partners.

Australia's network of double tax agreements, by comparison, stands at 46 agreements.

I also like to point out that entering into double tax agreements is not without cost.

They are complex technical agreements.

They are time consuming and costly to negotiate.

They give up revenue, lock in certain positions, and affect our ability to change tax policy.

They are also subject to the vagaries of interpretation and need to be maintained.

Accordingly, we do not enter into double tax agreements lightly.

Generally speaking, a double tax agreement should only be sought when there are clear indications that it is likely to be meaningful to New Zealand.

Unfortunately, no simple rules are possible when it comes to determining whether or not a double tax agreement with a particular country is in New Zealand's best interests.

A number of factors come into play.

Obvious considerations are the significance of the economic relationship, the likelihood of increased trade and investment and whether particular issues of double taxation are at stake.

We also look at broader strategic issues, and factors such as whether information exchange and other types of co-operation would be useful.

Of course, a key factor is also whether or not the other country actually wants a double tax agreement with New Zealand!

For the last two years, our main focus has been on securing lower withholding tax rates on dividends and royalties in our existing double tax agreements with key trading and investment partners.

Revised double tax agreements have now entered into force with Australia, Singapore and the United States.

Other renegotiations are in progress with Canada and the United Kingdom, with more in the pipeline.

At the same time, we are also looking to continue expanding our existing treaty network, as and when appropriate opportunities present themselves.

Earlier this month the Finance Minister Bill English signed a new agreement with Hong Kong, and negotiations with Vietnam have also now started.

As with renegotiations, a number of new double tax agreements negotiations are also in the pipeline.

I think it is fair to say that New Zealand's double tax agreement negotiating team has never been busier.

This brings us to the question of a double tax agreement with Papua New Guinea, which is where your interest lies.

Arguments have been presented to me that there is a good case for a double tax agreement with Papua New Guinea.

On the back of its long-term Liquefied Natural Gas projects, Papua New Guinea is a booming economy with almost every sector growing and providing new opportunities for New Zealand business.

For New Zealand exporters, Papua New Guinea's population of over six million and its economic potential makes the country very attractive and there are strong prospects to grow the market.

Currently, New Zealand's exports to Papua New Guinea account for only four percent of Papua New Guinea's total imports.

Clearly there are opportunities for growth, even when competing with countries such as Australia, China, and Japan, which all have a much greater share of the market.

With its significant natural resources, imports from Papua New Guinea are also attractive.

There are considerable opportunities for increased trade in service industries, for example, while telecommunications, education and tourism sectors are all potential growth areas as well.

However, New Zealand businesses face competition from overseas firms.

In the case of Australian companies, for example, the fact that Australia has a double tax agreement with Papua New Guinea means that our firms are competing at a disadvantage.

All of this is understood and appreciated by Government and I want to make it clear that the New Zealand government is sympathetic to your situation.

Having said that, I need to explain something of the process that is followed when embarking on a double taxation agreement.

I said before that we have other countries in the pipeline for double tax agreement consideration.

In fact we already have around 40 countries on our list for consideration, so the business of establishing priorities is a matter of careful judgement.

My personal expectation is that Papua New Guinea is a good candidate and should compare well against the other priorities.

As I have already mentioned, negotiation of a double tax agreement requires willingness on both sides to come to the table.

We would therefore first need to explore with Papua New Guinea whether they would be interested in a double tax agreement with New Zealand.

Papua New Guinea appears to have last entered into a tax treaty twelve years ago, in 1998, and currently only has a very small network of eight treaties.

Finally, there is the matter of timing.

Our current negotiating commitments with countries that have already progressed beyond this stage of the process will take up all of 2011, so realistically any new negotiations could not commence until 2012 at the earliest.

**Conclusion**

So, in summary, I think it is critical that the tax system does not stand in the way of businesses growing and thriving in New Zealand and beyond.

It is important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to invest in and a more attractive place to base multi-national enterprises.

The work we have already done with regard to international tax reform will play an important part in this regard and will help New Zealand businesses to be competitive.

The Government is mindful of trade opportunities between New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.

As promising as those are, we need to weigh those up against trade interests in other parts of the globe.

But as Papua New Guinea looks ahead to a promising future, I want to assure you that the New Zealand government wants to help New Zealand businesses be part of that future.

Media statement

### Dunne: New tax laws enacted

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne has welcomed the enactment of tax reforms introduced in the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill, saying they were a significant step towards increasing fairness and consistency across the tax system.

The new rules in the legislation enacted this week close off a loophole in the GST rules where some GST-registered purchasers have claimed a GST refund without the corresponding payment having been made because the supplier in the transaction has been deliberately wound up to avoid making the GST payment. 

The practice has been of particular concern in the property sector, where the GST involved can be substantial. 

The new rules will prevent such "phoenix" schemes by requiring GST-registered vendors to charge GST at a zero rate on most transactions involving land if the purchaser is also GST-registered.

Mr Dunne said the new rules were part of a package of changes announced by the Government in Budget 2010 to strengthen the integrity of the tax rules and make them fairer for everyone. 

"This included making the rules around access to social assistance fairer, where some people with substantial financial means have been able to structure their income in ways that have allowed them to gain advantages that are clearly unfair to other taxpayers. The new rules will put a stop to that," he said.

A number of these changes were introduced by supplementary order paper during the bill's passage.

They include:

*   broadening the definition of income for Working for Families, the Student Allowance and the Community Services Card to help prevent people from structuring their income to gain entitlements to these social assistance programmes; 
*   closing loopholes in the tax treatment of loss attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs); and
*   changes to clarify building depreciation rules made in Budget night legislation. The new rules confirm that people can still claim accelerated depreciation on the fit-out of commercial and industrial buildings. They will also be able to claim the depreciation loading on assets if the investment decisions were made before 20 May 2010, but not completed until sometime after.

The new legislation also introduces some useful changes to the GST rules to make it easier for taxpayers to understand their GST obligations, saving time and money, Mr Dunne said. They include simplified change-in-use rules and greater clarity over when GST applies to residential and commercial accommodation.

Other changes in the legislation were intended to make the tax laws easier for taxpayers to apply, he said, such as allowing PIEs a deduction for credit impairment provisions.

"And the further good news is that the redundancy tax credit previously repealed in Budget 2010 as a result of lower personal tax rates has been extended to 31 March 2011. The extension will be available to redundancy payments made before 1 April 2011and the tax credit will be paid at the rate of 6 cents in the dollar to a maximum of $3,600."

This measure is intended to prevent “phoenix” fraud schemes that involve Inland Revenue refunding GST to the purchaser with no corresponding payment being made by the vendor because the supplying company deliberately winds up before making payment. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features Application The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) will be amended by new section 11(1)(mb) which will require a GST-registered vendor to charge GST at the rate of 0% on any supply involving land or in which land is a component to a registered person who acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies. The new rules will not apply when the supply is a supply of land intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the purchaser or their relative (section 11(1)(mb)(ii)). This exclusion will prevent registered persons such as sole traders from using their GST-registered status to zero-rate the purchase of their family home. In circumstances when a principal place of residence forms part of a larger supply of land, the supply of the residence will be deemed to be a separate supply from the supply of the other land (section 5(15)). A new definition of “land” will be added to section 2(1) of the GST Act to include an estate or interest in land, a right that gives rise to an interest in land, or an option to acquire land or an interest in land. The definition will not apply to mortgages or supplies of accommodation in a dwelling. The new zero-rating rules will apply to any supply that involves land, irrespective of whether land is a predominant component of the supply. This will affect most supplies of “going concerns”, which often involve transfers of land, and in turn reduce the need to determine whether a going concern is being supplied. 4 New section 5(22) also extends the application of the zero-rating rules to certain supplies of land to which section 5(2) applies. For example, if a mortgagee sells a mortgaged property, subject to the obligation to account for GST under section 5(2), the mortgagee will be required to zero-rate the supply if the mortgagor would be required to zero-rate the transaction were they selling the property themselves. Vendor’s obligations Since the new rules apply to transactions between two registered persons, new section 78F(2) requires the vendor to obtain the purchaser’s registration details. The proposed zero-rating rules will not apply if the registered purchaser does not intend to use the goods for making taxable supplies or if the property is being purchased as the principal place of residence of the purchaser or their relative. Vendors will therefore be required to confirm with the purchaser their intentions in relation to the supply. If, in the circumstances relating to the supply, the vendor is unable to obtain the details described above, the vendor must make sufficient inquiries into the purchaser’s registration status and otherwise obtain all the information required (new section 78F(3)). Having obtained the necessary information about the purchaser’s registration status or the purchaser’s intentions regarding the use of the land, the vendor will not be liable for tax on the supply in a case of mistake or misrepresentation by the purchaser (new section 78F(4)). If the vendor fails to fully comply with their information-gathering obligations in section 78F(2) and (3), the vendor may be liable to account for tax even if it is also the case that the purchaser has provided incorrect information to them (new section 78F(5)). Although the vendor will not be required to account for any output tax for a zero-rated supply, they will need to disclose the zero-rated transaction on their GST return or an attachment to the GST return to be prescribed by Inland Revenue. This information will help Inland Revenue to identify the transaction and ensure that the purchaser complies with their apportionment obligations. Purchaser’s obligations New section 5(23) states that if an unregistered purchaser provides incorrect information to the vendor, the purchaser will be deemed to supply the goods and services to themselves and be liable to pay GST on the supply at the standard rate. For the purposes of this section, the unregistered purchaser will be required to register for GST (new section 51B(4)) and will not be able to claim a deduction in respect of the deemed supply (new section 20(4B)). In circumstances when the purchaser fails to provide the correct information to the vendor, the purchaser may be liable to account for tax even if the vendor has failed to fully comply with their information-gathering requirements in section 78F(2) and (3) (new section 78F(5)). This obligation on the purchaser to account for tax will only apply if the vendor has not accounted for the GST at the standard rate. 5 Under the rules for apportionment of input tax and change-in-use adjustments also proposed in this bill, any input tax deduction that can be claimed by a purchaser will be based on the GST paid by the purchaser and the intended taxable use of the goods and services. Since the amount of input tax in a zero-rated supply is zero, special rules will be required to ensure that any non-taxable use of acquired land is accounted for. New section 20(3I) will require the purchaser to account for tax on the acquisition of a zero-rated asset when they do not intend to use the asset solely for the purpose of making taxable supplies – that is, the asset is also used privately or in making exempt supplies. This will be done by the purchaser having to calculate, on acquisition, the amount of GST that would have been paid by the vendor if the supply was subject to the standard rate of GST (the nominal GST component), and account to Inland Revenue for the proportion of the nominal GST component that relates to the non-taxable use of the acquired supply. The nominal GST component will also be used by the purchaser to make adjustments for any subsequent change in use. Example of a zero-rated transaction Nominations Nominations are often used in transactions that involve transfers of land. For example, although a contract for a transfer of land may be between a vendor and a purchaser, the transaction may instead be settled and the title in land received by a third party nominated by the purchaser (the nominee). The bill includes the introduction of new rules that would govern the GST treatment of transactions involving nominations. The purpose of the rules is to ensure that the GST treatment of a nominee transaction follows its economic substance. How the economic substance is determined depends on which party (the nominee or the purchaser) pays the consideration. The new nomination rules will particularly affect land transactions when a contractual purchaser and a nominated person have a different GST registration status. For example, registered vendor A may agree to sell land to an unregistered purchaser B. Because of B’s unregistered status, A may have initially treated the transaction as VendorPurchaser IRD Land (zero-rated) Consideration No output tax. GST return indicates a zero-rated supply No input tax. Account for non-taxable use of land 6 subject to the standard GST rules. However, if purchaser B has nominated a registered person C to settle the transaction, the new nomination rules will treat the transaction as between A and C (new section 60B(5)). Therefore, the supply will need to be zero- rated by the vendor (and they will be able to claim back any output tax already paid in relation to the supply). Conversely, registered vendor A may agree to sell land to a registered purchaser B. Because of B’s registered status, A may have initially treated the transaction as subject to the zero-rating rules. However, if B nominates an unregistered person C to settle the transaction, the new nomination rules will again treat the transaction as between A and C. As a result, A would be required to charge GST on the supply at the standard rate. Background In November 2009, the Government released the discussion document GST: Accounting for land and other high-value assets, which proposed a number of changes to the GST Act 1985 that would address certain GST base risks and improve the operation of the GST system more generally. The main risk to the tax base identified in the discussion document was “phoenix” fraud schemes that often occur between associated entities and involve Inland Revenue refunding GST to one party with no corresponding payment being made by the vendor because the vendor deliberately winds up the business before making payment. Example of a phoenix fraud transaction A B (unrelated to A) C (associate of B) IRD A pays output tax B claims input tax B winds up; no output tax C claims input tax 7 In considering this concern, the discussion document proposed a domestic reverse charge to transactions principally involving land, “going concerns” and assets with a value of $50 million or more. The zero-rating option was mentioned in the discussion document, but was not preferred. The preference for the domestic reverse charge largely resulted from concerns that zero-rating would not deal well with situations when an unregistered purchaser purports to be registered or when parties mistakenly zero-rate a transaction. However, most submitters expressed a preference for zero-rating as it would give rise to fewer compliance costs. While both mechanisms would be effective, the domestic reverse-charge would introduce a new method of accounting for GST under which the obligations of parties to a transactions would significantly differ from those under the normal GST rules. Under the zero-rating mechanism, the accounting obligations of the parties would remain virtually unchanged. Accordingly, zero-rating the relevant transactions to the GST base risk is likely to be an easier mechanism for businesses to deal with. Any remaining concerns regarding zero-rating are intended to be resolved by anti- avoidance provisions. Submissions on the discussion document considered that for large-value non-land transactions, current Inland Revenue processes to allow an offset of the output and input tax between registered parties in order to avoid carrying costs and other risks are working effectively. The $50m threshold for zero-rating outlined in the discussion document was considered by most to be unnecessary and is not therefore included in this bill. 8 TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING NOMINATIONS (Clauses 15 and 18) Summary of proposed amendments The GST legislation is to be amended to clarify that, in transactions involving nominations, when a contractual purchaser nominates another person to receive the goods or services from the contractual vendor, the GST treatment should be determined on the basis of the transaction’s economic substance. The amendment will ensure that the GST Act 1985 provides guidance regarding the GST treatment of transactions that involve more than two parties. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features New section 60B will be added to the GST Act 1985 to clarify the GST treatment of transactions involving nominations – that is, when a contractual purchaser nominates another person (a nominee) to receive the goods or services from the contractual vendor. In these circumstances, the GST treatment will depend on which party provides payment for the supply of goods or services: • In transactions when the contractual purchaser provides the full payment for the supply, there will be only one supply from the vendor to the purchaser. The purchaser will be the only party entitled to an input tax deduction (section 60B(2)). • When a nominee settles the transaction by paying the full purchase price to the vendor, the proposed rules will treat the arrangement as involving one transaction – from the vendor to the nominee (section 60B(3)). • When both a contractual purchaser and the nominee contribute to the payment for the supply, the proposed new rules will treat the transaction as involving a single supply between the vendor and the purchaser, with the purchaser being entitled to the input tax deduction (section 60B(4)). However, the purchaser and the nominee will be able to override this default rule by explicitly agreeing that the supply of the property be treated as a supply by the vendor to the nominee. No such agreement can, however, be made if the purchaser has already claimed input tax in relation to the supply. • Notwithstanding the above, when a contractual purchaser and the nominee have a different registration status, the transaction will be always treated as involving a single supply between the vendor and the nominee, with the nominee being entitled to the input tax deduction, if any (new section 60B(5)). 9 • Under other changes proposed in the bill (clause 10), GST-registered vendors will be required to charge GST at the rate of 0% on any supply to a registered person involving land or in which land is a component. The proposed nomination rule for situations when a purchaser and the nominee have a different registration status may potentially affect whether such a transaction is zero-rated. The proposed nomination rules will also affect the tax invoice requirements. In normal circumstances, a taxpayer must have a tax invoice to claim an input tax deduction. In transactions involving nominations, a nominee may not have the tax invoice as it may have been issued to the purchaser. In these circumstances, new section 24(7B) will require a nominee to maintain records that would allow information such as the name and address of the supply, the date of the payment for the supply, a description of the goods supplied, and the payment for the supply to be ascertained. Background GST is often described as a tax on transactions. Most transactions involve only two parties – a contractual vendor and a purchaser – and much of the GST Act operates on that assumption. The GST Act is not generally designed to cater for transactions involving nominees. Nominee transactions would ordinarily involve a purchaser nominating another person (a nominee) to receive the goods and/or settle the transaction. In the absence of appropriate guidance, taxpayers have sometimes been uncertain about the GST treatment of nominee transactions, especially in relation to claiming input tax deductions. The Government consulted on the proposed legislative clarification of the nomination rules as part of the 2009 discussion document, GST: Accounting for land and other high-value assets. Submitters on the discussion document generally supported the proposed approach to determine the GST treatment of transactions involving nominations on the basis of the transaction’s economic substance. The bill reflects this approach and gives taxpayers greater certainty when entering transactions involving nominees. 10 SUPPLIES OF ACCOMMODATION (Clause 4(3) and (4)) Summary of proposed amendment The GST legislation is to be amended to clarify the boundaries of the definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” as the current legislative framework does not give taxpayers enough certainty about when the supply of accommodation should be treated as a taxable or exempt supply. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features Under the current rules, accommodation provided by GST-registered persons in a “commercial dwelling” is taxable whereas accommodation provided in a “dwelling” is treated as an exempt supply. The definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” in section 2(1) of the GST Act 1985 are being amended to give suppliers more certainty on whether they supply accommodation in a “dwelling” or a “commercial dwelling”. This will be mainly achieved by narrowing the definition of “dwelling” and updating the list of accommodations that should be treated as “commercial dwelling”. The definition of “dwelling” When the GST Act 1985 was introduced, the exemption for accommodation in a “dwelling” was intended to apply to situations when there is a reasonable level of substitutability between renting and owning a home. Arguably, this goal is not currently being achieved because of the wide interpretation of the definition. To achieve the purpose behind exempting supplies of accommodation in “dwelling”, the definition will be amended to be construed more narrowly. Under the current definition of “dwelling”, the application of GST is based on the functional nature of the premises in which the accommodation is provided, rather than on the intention of the supplier and the recipient for the use of the property. The definition of “dwelling” will therefore be amended to refer to the nature of the occupation of the accommodation by the recipient of the supply. 11 Under the proposed changes, for accommodation to be a “dwelling” it must be occupied by the recipient as their principal place of residence. Moreover, an important characteristic of home ownership is that the owner enjoys an exclusive possession of their property. For an accommodation to be a “dwelling”, the definition will also be amended to require that a tenant possesses an exclusive possession of their accommodation. Thus, for example, supplies of accommodation in a typical rental property by way of lease will continue be treated as exempt for GST purposes. The definition of “commercial dwelling” The current definition of “commercial dwelling” provides a list of types of accommodation should be treated as commercial dwellings for GST purposes. This list will be amended by expressly including homestays, farmstays, bed and breakfast establishments, and serviced apartments as these types of accommodation are supplied as an alternative to hotels and motels and therefore should be subject to the same GST treatment. The express inclusion of these types of accommodation within the definition of “commercial dwelling” will ensure that there is no uncertainty about their GST treatment. Since it is difficult to identify and specifically list in the legislation all possible current and future types of accommodation that should be treated as commercial dwellings, it is necessary to have a comprehensive catch-all provision. The catch-all” provision is being added to the definition of “commercial dwelling” to cover all types of accommodation that are not “dwellings”. The provision ensures that if a supply of accommodation neither satisfies the definition of “dwelling” and is not expressly or explicitly covered by the definition of “commercial dwelling”, the supply should be treated as a supply of a commercial dwelling. Background In October 2006, Inland Revenue released a draft interpretation statement about the exemption from GST for accommodation provided in a dwelling. Inland Revenue received a number of comprehensive submissions on the draft, many requesting that the policy underlying the GST treatment of accommodation be reviewed. Most submissions were concerned that the current legislative framework did not give taxpayers enough certainty about when the supply of accommodation should be treated as a taxable or exempt supply. Accommodation provided by GST-registered persons is generally taxable unless it is expressly treated as an exempt supply. The GST Act 1985 expressly exempts the supply of accommodation in a “dwelling”, but not accommodation that is a “commercial dwelling”. The main reason for exempting the supply of accommodation in a dwelling from GST, as described in the 1985 White Paper Proposals for the Administration of the Goods and Services Tax, was to ensure that owner-occupiers of residential dwellings were not placed in an advantageous position compared with those who rent. For this reason, the definition was intended to apply to situations where there was a reasonable level of substitutability between renting and owning a home. This goal has not been achieved because of the wide interpretation of the definition of “dwelling”. 12 Current uncertainty around the boundary between the definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” may create difficulties for suppliers of accommodation in identifying whether they are making taxable or exempt supplies. This can result in different suppliers of essentially the same type of accommodation treating their supplies differently for GST purposes, because of their differing interpretations of what constitutes a “dwelling” or “commercial dwelling”. This uncertainty can result in compliance costs to taxpayers and revenue loss to the Government as a result of some commercially provided accommodation being treated as exempt from GST. 13 INPUT TAX AND CHANGE-IN-USE ADJUSTMENTS (Clauses 4, 5, 13, and 14) Summary of proposed amendments The GST legislation is to be amended to replace the existing change-in-use adjustment provisions that deal with the mixed use of goods and services with an approach that reflects their relative use and apportions related input tax deductions. The proposed approach is expected to be easier to use and understand than the current rules. Application date The amendments will apply to goods and services acquired after 1 April 2011 with a transitional rule to allow goods and services held before 1 April 2011 also to be subject to the new rules. Key features Apportionment of input tax on acquisition It is proposed that the GST Act 1985 be amended by a new section 20(3A) that will allow a GST-registered recipient to apportion GST incurred on the acquisition of goods and services and claim an input tax deduction for goods or services that are used for making taxable supplies. In determining the extent to which goods or services are used for making taxable supplies, a person must estimate how they intend to use the goods or services, and choose a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result (new section 20(3F)). The estimated intended taxable use of the goods or services will then be used by the person to claim the proportion of the input tax that corresponds with the estimated intended taxable use (new section 20(3G)). New section 20(3I) will also require an apportionment of input tax when a supply that includes land is zero-rated under the zero-rating rules proposed in clause 10. Since, technically, the input tax under a zero-rated transaction is zero, the provision will require the purchaser to identify the nominal amount of tax that would be chargeable under section 8(1) in relation to the supply if the zero-rating rules did not apply. The purchaser will then be required to estimate the intended non-taxable use of the goods or services and account for this amount as output tax. As a consequence of the proposed input tax regime not relying on the “principal purpose” test as the current regime does, the definition of “input tax” in section 3A will be amended to exclude references to the “principal purpose” test. 14 When apportionment on acquisition is not required New section 20(3D) will relieve recipients from the obligation to apportion the input tax on acquisition of goods or services if a recipient makes mainly taxable supplies. These recipients will not be required to apportion input tax if they make both taxable and exempt supplies and have reasonable grounds to believe that the total value of their exempt supplies will be no more that the lesser of $90,000 or 5% of the total payment for all taxable and exempt supplies for the period beginning at least 12 months from acquisition and ending on the date that corresponds to the person’s balance date. Subsequent adjustments of input tax deductions In an “adjustment period” following the initial input tax deduction claim on acquisition, taxpayers may be required to make further adjustments if the actual taxable use of an asset is different from its intended taxable use. “Adjustment period” An “adjustment period” will be a period at the end of which a person is required to estimate whether an adjustment for a subsequent change in use is required. The first adjustment period will start on the date of acquisition and end at least 12 months after the acquisition on the date that corresponds to the person’s balance date. All subsequent adjustment periods will be annual and start the day after the end of the previous adjustment period (new section 21F(2)). There will be a maximum number of adjustment periods during which adjustments will be required to be made. The default method for identifying the maximum number of adjustment periods is in new section 21F(3)(a) and requires the taxpayer to refer to the following GST-exclusive bands of goods and services: • $5,001 to $10,000 – two adjustments; • $10,001 to $500,000 – five adjustments; • $500,001 or more – ten adjustments. Alternatively, taxpayers will be able to select the maximum number of adjustments by reference to the estimated useful life of the asset as specified in the Commissioners Table of Depreciation Rates (new section 21F(3)(b)). There will be no limit to adjustment periods in relation to land (new section 21F(4)). When subsequent change-in-use adjustments will not be required No subsequent change-in-use adjustment will be required for goods and services that fall under a minimum threshold of $5,000 (new section 21(2)(b)). For assets with a value of more than $5,000, no adjustment will be required in the relevant adjustment period if the recipient makes both taxable and exempt supplies and has reasonable grounds to believe that the total value of their exempt supplies will be no more than the lesser of $90,000 or 5% of the total amount payable for all taxable and exempt supplies for that adjustment period (new section 21(2)(a)). 15 If none of the above exclusions apply, new sections 21A and 21B provide that, at the end of an adjustment period, a person must compare the percentage of the actual taxable use of goods or services with: • the percentage of the intended taxable use of the goods or services (if no previous adjustment has been made); or • the previous actual use (if the goods or services have been subject to a previous adjustment). The “percentage actual use” is defined in new section 21F(1)(a) as the extent to which the goods or services are actually used by the person for making taxable supplies. It is calculated from the date of acquisition to the end of the relevant adjustment period. The estimates must be expressed in percentages. The “percentage intended use” is defined in new section 21F(1)(b) as the extent to which the goods or services are intended to be used by the person for making taxable supplies, estimated at the time of acquisition. The estimates must be expressed in percentages. The “previous actual use” is defined in new section 21B(b)(i) as the percentage actual use in an earlier period that is the most recent period in which an adjustment has been made. If the percentage of intended taxable use or previous actual use of goods or services is equal to the percentage actual use, the person will not be required to make an adjustment in the relevant adjustment period. If the actual taxable use of goods or services differs from the intended taxable use of goods or services as estimated on acquisition, the person will still not be required to make the adjustment in an adjustment period if the difference between the amounts is less than 10% and the monetary value of the adjustment is less than $1,000 (new section 21(2)(c)). If, however, the actual taxable use of goods or services exceeds either of these thresholds, the person will be required to make an adjustment and will not be able to use the exclusion in section 21(2)(c) in any of their subsequent adjustment periods (new section 21(3)). Calculating adjustments If none of the exclusions mentioned above apply, the person will need to account for a change in use. New section 21C sets out how to calculate the amount of a change-in-use adjustment for the adjustment period. The formula provided in this section will identify the amount of the adjustment by applying the difference between the actual and intended taxable uses or the previous actual use of goods or services to the amount of the full input tax deduction. The resulting amount will be then either accounted for by the person as output tax (if there has been a decrease in taxable use) or claimed as input tax (if there has been an increase in taxable use). 16 Special rule for concurrent use of land A special rule will be introduced to deal with situations when land is used concurrently for a taxable purpose and a non-taxable purpose, such as when land is simultaneously advertised for sale (taxable use) and rented out as a dwelling (non-taxable use). In these circumstances, a question may arise over what the taxable use of the land is. To remove doubt, new section 21D provides formulas to enable taxpayers to calculate the extent to which land is used for making taxable supplies. Section 21D(3) requires a registered person to calculate the extent to which the land is used for making taxable supplies by using the formula: Consideration for taxable supply x 100% Total consideration for supply The “consideration for taxable supply” will be defined as either the amount derived on a disposal of the land or, if the land has not been disposed of, the market value of the land at the time of the adjustment. The “total consideration for supply” will be defined as the sum of the “consideration for the taxable supply” and the amount of all rental income derived from the land since the land was acquired or the market value of rental income that would have been derived if the land had been used for this purpose. New section 21D(5) specifies that the market value must be used in determining “consideration for the taxable supply” and/or “total consideration for supply” if amounts derived under those definitions are not arm’s-length amounts. The amount resulting from the use of the formula in section 21D(3) represents the proportion of the land used for taxable purposes. An additional formula (section 21D(6)) estimates the extent of taxable use of the land if the land has, at any time, been used solely for making non-taxable supplies. By taking into account the solely non-taxable use of the land, the formula will reduce the extent of the taxable use of the land calculated under the formula in section 21D(3). Section 21D will not apply if the Commissioner of Inland Revenue agrees that the registered person may use another calculation method (section 21D(2)). Adjustment on disposal If a registered person disposes of, or is treated as disposing of, goods or services in the course of a taxable activity and has not claimed a full input tax deduction, they may be able to claim an additional amount of input tax (new section 21E). The amount that can be claimed on disposal cannot exceed the total amount of input tax to which the person would be entitled if they had acquired the goods or services solely for making taxable supplies. 17 Consequential amendments Clauses 25, 29(2) and 35 are consequential amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007. They ensure that input and output tax calculated under the apportionment rules are taken into account in the relevant income tax and depreciation calculations. Transitional provision New section 21G provides transitional relief for taxpayers who may wish to apply the new approach to their existing assets rather than have them grandparented. To transition into the new rules, registered persons will have to treat themselves as disposing of the relevant goods or services at market value (and account for output tax on the disposal) and then acquiring the goods or services for the same market value under the new rules. To ensure that transitional provisions do not result in any windfall payments, subsection (4) specifies that the person will not be entitled to recover any amounts of an adjustment made under the current adjustment rules. Background New Zealand’s current approach to accounting for the taxable and non-taxable use of assets on which GST is paid involves deeming a supply to occur when an asset which is used for business purposes is subsequently used for private or exempt purposes, or vice versa. This approach has been described by commentators and taxpayers as complex and confusing. The lack of relationship between the initial input tax deduction claimed and the change-in-use adjustments, means that the concepts behind imposing GST on mixed use and changes in the use of assets may not be sufficiently transparent for many taxpayers and that adjustments may be required for an indefinite period. This can result in unforeseen tax and compliance costs. The possibility of making adjustments on either the cost basis or the open market value basis can also leave the regime open to manipulation. In the 2009 discussion document, GST: Accounting for land and other high-value assets, the Government proposed to replace the existing change-in-use adjustment approach with one that would apportion input tax deductions in line with the actual use of the goods and services. Submitters on the discussion document in general supported the proposed changes. 18 GST REVERSE CHARGE RULES (Clauses 7 and 8) Summary of proposed amendments The GST reverse charge rules for imported services are being amended as a consequence of the introduction of the apportionment rules. The amendment will tie the use of imported services to the defined terms “percentage intended use” and “percentage actual use” to ensure that appropriate apportionment of imported services takes place following the introduction of the new rules. Application date The amendments will apply to services imported after 1 April 2011. Key features It is proposed that section 8(4B) of the GST Act 1985 be amended to apply to imported services when the recipient of the supply: • estimates at the time of acquisition that the percentage intended use of the services is less than 95%; or • determines that the percentage actual use is less than 90%. Background The apportionment rules set out in clauses 13 to 14 of this bill apply to apportion input tax on a particular supply to ensure that only the appropriate amount of input tax can be claimed. A fundamental feature of these rules is for there to be an amount of input tax for the rules to “attach” to. Under the existing rules, if a registered person makes taxable supplies 95% or more of which are taxable supplies, the person does not need to apply the reverse charge rules. However, if the person then applies those services for a non-taxable use, they are required to “self-supply” the relevant portion of the services under the change-in-use rules – thereby creating an output tax liability. If the same situation occurred under the proposed apportionment rules, the person would not be liable to apply the reverse charge (as is currently the case). However, the starting premise of the apportionment rules is that there is an original amount of input tax on the supply that is used as the benchmark for future adjustments. Therefore, when it comes to accounting for any non-taxable use, the apportionment rules would arguably not apply because there was no original amount of input tax to refer back to. 19 The amendment seeks to remedy the problem by deeming there to be a supply when either the percentage intended use is less than 95% or the percentage actual use falls below 90%. The 90% threshold is used to effectively factor in the 10% minimum change in use allowed under the proposed apportionment rules. Where the 90% percentage actual use test is the trigger for the liability, clause 8 treats the adjustment period in which the percentage actual drops below 90% as the time of supply, so the registered person does not have to revisit previous returns to account for the supply. Once the supply has taken place for GST purposes, the apportionment rules set out in clauses 13 to 14 should operate in the usual manner to apportion the input tax on that supply. It is not anticipated that these changes will have a great impact on the primary users of the reverse charge rules. Although the rules have changed from a “type of business” test to a focus on supply by supply, most users of these rules already apply change-in- use adjustments to supplies where some of the supply was used for taxable supplies. Application of the rules proposed here should therefore mean that the apportionment rules produce the same overall result as the current rules. 20 APPLICATION OF SECTION 19D TO NON-PROFIT BODIES (Clause 92, 93, 94 and 95) Summary of proposed amendments The GST legislation will be amended to exclude non-profit bodies from the application of section 19D when the risk of tax avoidance is low, therefore allowing them to operate without the additional cost of having to fund the full cost of GST upfront. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features New section 19D(2B) will be introduced to exclude supplies made by a non-profit body from the application of section 19D(1) in the following circumstances: • when the recipient is not GST-registered; and • when the recipient is either not intending to use the goods and services for the purposes of carrying on a taxable activity or intending to use the goods and services for the purposes of carrying on a taxable activity, only after the full payment for the supply is paid to the supplier. Background Differences in the accounting practices for GST can result in timing advantages being deliberately created when a registered person who accounts for GST on a payment basis makes a supply to another registered person who accounts on an invoice basis. In these situations, the payments-basis supplier accounts for GST when payment is received, while the purchaser may claim an input tax deduction following receipt of the tax invoice. The aim of section 19D is to limit taxpayers’ choices of accounting bases when the application of GST accounting principles could give rise to tax-base risks. Specifically, section 19D requires GST-registered suppliers accounting for GST using the payments basis to use the invoice basis when the amount payable for a supply of goods and services is $225,000 or more (including GST) and payment by the customer is deferred. Section 19D applies to all taxpayers. The universal application of section 19D may have an unintended detrimental effect on some non-profit bodies. Thus, a non-profit body may agree to supply an asset, such as a house, to an individual in need. Often the agreement will stipulate that the recipient of the asset will make a number of payments over a period of time and will receive the title in the asset when the asset has been paid for in full. 21 These types of arrangements may trigger section 19D, and require the non-profit body to account for GST on an invoice basis. This would result in the non-profit body having to account for the GST on the entire purchase price at the outset, creating a significant cost to the non-profit body. Consequently, the operation of the rule may discourage non-profit bodies from providing goods and services over a certain value. 22 SECTION DB 2 – REVERSE CHARGE RULES (Clauses 29(1), 90 and 104) Summary of proposed amendment A technical change is being made to section DB 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (and the corresponding provisions in the Income Tax Acts 1994 and 2004) to ensure that GST output tax on services that are subject to the reverse charge rules for imported services is available as a deduction for income tax purposes (provided the underlying services were also deductible). This amendment corrects an anomaly for taxpayers who arguably are not able to deduct this GST at present, despite it representing a real economic cost to business. Application date The change applies from 1 January 2005, the date the reverse charge rules were introduced. Key features Section DB 2 is being amended to ensure that output tax, to the extent that it is not offset by input tax credits attributable to the supply, is deductible in the following circumstances: • the output tax arises under the rules related to the reverse charge for imported services; and • the underlying services are themselves able to be deducted. Background Currently, section DB 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 denies an income tax deduction for both input tax and GST paid by the taxpayer to the Commissioner. The economic effect of this provision is that a taxpayer is denied a deduction for all output tax it receives as a supplier, less any input tax able to be claimed for its own expenses. Although this economic effect is generally desirable, it does not work when a GST- registered person is deemed to supply goods or services to themselves. Until recently, the only example of this enforced “self-supply” was when a taxpayer who acquired goods or services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies used the goods or service for non-taxable purposes (known as a “change in use adjustment”). To recognise that the output tax on these supplies is a real cost to the taxpayer (that is, it cannot be offset by input tax), section DB 2(2) specifically allows it as a deduction. 23 Since 1 January 2005, when certain services are imported into New Zealand, the GST Act 1985 requires the New Zealand resident to treat itself as the supplier of those services (as well as being the recipient) and account for GST accordingly. This is another example of “self-supply” and is conceptually identical to the change in use adjustments. However, unlike the change in use rules, there is no specific provision in the Income Tax Act 2007 to allow any irrecoverable output tax incurred on the self- supply to be allowed as an income tax deduction. As a result, arguably, the general rule in section DB 2(1) applies and the taxpayer is denied a deduction, despite the fact that the expenditure is “real” in an economic sense. This anomaly potentially creates a discrepancy in income tax treatment between services that are sourced in New Zealand (and therefore not subject to the reverse charge) and those that are sourced offshore. The amendment will apply from 1 January 2005 (the application date of the reverse charge rules that are the root of the problem), to provide certainty going forward and provide taxpayers with comfort that Inland Revenue will not adopt a strict interpretation of section DB 2 for the intervening periods. 24 MISCELLANEOUS TECHNICAL AMENDMENT: GST – FILING DATES FOR “SPECIAL RETURNS” (Clause 11) Summary of proposed amendment A technical change is being made to section 17(1B) of the GST Act 1985. Section was amended in 2007 to confirm the filing dates for “special returns” (being the return that a creditor must file when selling goods in satisfaction of a debt owing). An unintended consequence of this amendment is that the due date for the actual payment of tax related to the return was removed. Section 17 is being amended to clarify that the relevant tax is payable not later than the due date for the return. Application date The change applies from 30 November 2007, the date the 2007 amendment took effect to ensure that there are no periods for which the relevant output tax is arguably not payable. Key features Section 17 of the GST Act 1985 is being amended to ensure that output tax charged on a supply that is a sale in satisfaction of debt under section 5(2) is payable to the Commissioner not later than the due date for the relevant return. Background Section 17 requires a person selling any goods that are being sold in satisfaction of a debt under section 5(2) – for example, a mortgagee sale – to file a special return in relation to that supply. Prior to an amendment in 2007, section 17 provided that this return was to be filed, and the relevant tax paid, on or before the 28th of the month following the month in which the sale took place. The 2007 amendment was introduced to confirm that the filing date for these special returns was the “standard” filing date for GST returns (which is not always the 28th of the following month). A consequence of this amendment was that the payment date for the relevant tax was removed. The proposed amendment confirms that the person responsible for filing the special return must complete all of the obligations imposed on them under section 17(1)(a) to (c) on or before the due date for filing the special return. This includes the obligation to pay the amount of tax charged on the supply. 25 KiwiSaver remedials 26 27 SHARING OF KIWISAVER MEMBER INFORMATION (Clauses 81 and 100) Summary of proposed amendments The bill amends the KiwiSaver Act 2006 and Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow the sharing of information about a KiwiSaver member between their scheme provider and Inland Revenue. This information is limited to a member’s address, date of birth and IRD number (tax file number). This amendment will help to ensure that both the scheme providers and Inland Revenue hold accurate contact details, allowing the communication of vital KiwiSaver information to members. Currently, if a member updates their information they are required to advise both their scheme provider and Inland Revenue, as both send out different items of KiwiSaver correspondence. This amendment removes impediments that may occur if only one party gets updated. The sharing of information is to be completed electronically. Application date The new rules will apply from the date of enactment. Key features • New section 220B of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 will allow Inland Revenue and a scheme provider to communicate information about a member’s name, address (including their email address), date of birth and IRD number (tax file number) to each other. • Section 81(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be amended to provide an exception to the secrecy requirements for information disclosed by Inland Revenue to scheme providers under new section 220B of the KiwiSaver Act. • The information must be communicated through electronic means ensuring accuracy, timeliness and adherence to e-government standards. Background A newly registered KiwiSaver member’s details are provided to Inland Revenue by their employer. 28 Under section 51(3) of the KiwiSaver Act, Inland Revenue is required to provide address details as part of the default allocation process. This is necessary because the provider has no prior direct contact with the member as the allocation is completed by Inland Revenue. Under the default allocation process a KiwiSaver member should only be allocated to a default provider in the case of new membership or in the event of an involuntary transfer due to a scheme wind-up. At any other time Inland Revenue is unable to pass on address details, even in the event of the address being updated with Inland Revenue, because of the secrecy provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Given that the current provision to share a person’s address applies only on joining KiwiSaver, the member is required to update both Inland Revenue and their scheme provider, if their details change, as they often do, throughout their membership. Generally if a KiwiSaver member updates their address, they are likely to contact one but not both parties. For example, if a scheme provider gets an updated address from their member, they have no obligation to pass that information on to Inland Revenue. This can result in Inland Revenue holding an invalid address for the member while the scheme provider holds a valid address or vice-versa. Currently both parties have a number of invalid or unknown addresses for members, and the non-sharing of member information is one of the reasons for this. The proposed amendments will improve the delivery to members of vital information about KiwiSaver, such as investment statements, annual reports and contribution holiday letters. It also allows both Inland Revenue and scheme providers to proactively contact KiwiSaver members when needed and will lower the volume of returned mail for both parties. 29 REFINEMENTS TO SCHEME WIND-UP PROVISIONS (Clauses 94 to 99) Summary of proposed amendments If a KiwiSaver scheme provider winds up their operation and ceases to exist, Inland Revenue manages the transfer of members to a new scheme, following notification by the scheme trustees or the Government Actuary. Several remedial amendments to the scheme wind-up provisions within the KiwiSaver Act 2006 will fine-tune the current provisions, ensuring they give full effect to the scheme wind-up policy intent. These amendments clarify the date a member is allocated to a new scheme, add a requirement for scheme providers to supply the IRD number (tax file number) they hold for transferring members, and remove the requirement to send additional information packs to existing members. Application date The new rules will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Allocation to a new scheme Once scheme trustees resolve to wind up their scheme and nominate an effective date of closure, they have 14 days to lodge a copy of the notice with both the Government Actuary and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Currently, section 50(3) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 determines that when the Commissioner receives notice from a provider of the impending wind-up, the member must be default-allocated to another scheme as soon as practicable. Section 51(4)(b) determines that the final date of allocation to the new scheme should be three months after the date on which the notice was received. These sections do not take into account the effective date of closure nominated by the winding-up scheme in the notice. This is likely to be the date that transfer of membership has been arranged for. Having the final allocation set at three months after the date that notification was received can cause an early transfer of members. This affects the scheme provider’s obligations to continue to meet the provisions of their trust deed until the scheme is wound up. 30 To allow the winding up scheme to retain its members and their contributions until its date of closure, sections 50(4), 51(1) and 57(1) are being amended so that the allocation will occur on whichever is later, the date notification of wind-up is received or the date on which the winding up takes effect. It will no longer impose the requirement to have a three-month provisional period for these members. Supply of tax file number Within 14 days of the wind-up resolution being made, section 173(1) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 requires the trustees of the winding-up scheme to supply the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, the names and addresses of the scheme members. Inland Revenue uses this information to verify the identity of the member. To ensure more robust identification, an amendment is being made to section 173(1)(b) requiring trustees to also supply the tax file numbers that they hold for these members. Issuing of information packs A KiwiSaver information pack contains general introductory information explaining the savings initiative. It is primarily targeted at new or prospective members. Section 59(a) currently provides that KiwiSaver information packs should be sent to members when their scheme is winding up, so that they are aware of the default allocation rules and how to access information about KiwiSaver schemes. Section 59(a) requires the packs to be sent to all members of the winding-up scheme including existing members who have already made an active choice about their new scheme. However, all of the members would have already received this information pack when they joined KiwiSaver. Members are therefore receiving unnecessary or duplicate information, which can be confusing and irrelevant to their current situation. Additionally, Inland Revenue sends a letter to affected members advising them of the wind-up and the required actions. These letters are tailored to suit the member’s situation. For example, those who have not chosen a scheme are given information about the default allocation rules and how to access information about KiwiSaver schemes. Section 59(a) will be amended to remove the requirement to send an information pack to members whose scheme is being wound up. 31 32 Other remedial matters 33 34 ON PREMISES FRINGE BENEFIT TAX EXEMPTION (Clauses 28 and 89) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being made to clarify the scope of the exemption from fringe benefit tax (FBT) for benefits provided on the premises of an employer (or a member of an employer’s group of companies). The amendment is necessary because the wording used by the rewritten Income Tax Act 2004 has resulted in some confusion regarding the scope of the exemption. To reaffirm the policy behind the provision, the amendment confirms that only benefits “used or consumed” on the relevant premises are exempt from FBT. Application date The change applies from 1 April 2005, the date the Income Tax Act 2004 took effect. Key features Section CX 20 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section CX 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are being amended to ensure that the scope of the “on premises” exemption from FBT remains consistent with the policy intent of their corresponding provision in the Income Tax Act 1994. Background The “on premises” exemption contained in the Income Tax Act 1994 excluded from the definition of “fringe benefit” a benefit that is provided by an employer on the employer’s premises “where the benefit is enjoyed by the employee on those premises”. The equivalent provisions in the 2004 Income Tax Act, provide that a benefit is not a fringe benefit if it is provided by an employer to an employee and is “received or used by the employee on the premises of the employer”. Some taxpayers have argued that providing employees with vouchers for future use (such as grocery vouchers) means the exemption applies – on the basis that the voucher was “received” by the employee on the employer’s premises. This interpretation could logically extend to any expensive and mobile goods given to the employee at the employer’s premises that can be taken away for the employee’s benefit. There was no intention to extend the scope of the relevant definition as part of the rewrite process. Although the effect of the 1994 Act wording was initially “saved” by a provision in the 2004 Act, that saving stopped applying when an unrelated amendment was made to the provision in 2006. The 2006 amendment was directed at a separate point, and no widening of the exemption was intended. 35 The current amendment will clarify that the policy intent of the exemption remains consistent with the provision in the 1994 Act. Benefits will be exempt when they are “used or consumed” on the relevant premises – wording more closely aligned with the “enjoyed” concept used in the 1994 Act. The amendment will therefore be effective from 1 April 2005, the date on which the 2004 Act took effect, to remove any confusion over the correct treatment of benefits provided on premises for the intervening periods. 36 JOINT BANK ACCOUNTS (Clauses 16, 86 ad 105) Summary of proposed amendments The provisions of some Inland Revenue Acts which allow deductions of tax from payments due to a defaulting taxpayer are being amended to allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make deductions of tax from joint bank accounts. The amendments will allow deductions from a joint bank account if the defaulting taxpayer can make withdrawals from that account without the signature of the other person. The changes will ensure consistency of treatment for deductions from joint bank accounts. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Section 12L of the Gaming Duties Act 1971, section 43 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are being amended to allow the Commissioner to make deductions from joint bank accounts if the defaulting taxpayer can make withdrawals from that account without the signature of the other person. This is consistent with the existing deduction power in the Child Support Act 1991 and will ensure a consistent approach to joint bank accounts. Background When a taxpayer fails to pay any income tax, interest or civil penalty the Commissioner may issue a written notice to any third party, for example, a bank, requiring the third party to deduct and pay to the Commissioner funds from any amounts payable to the defaulting taxpayer. The deductions may be in the form of a lump sum or instalments. Currently, section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 does not refer to joint bank accounts. The courts have held that the Commissioner cannot issue a deduction notice to obtain funds from a joint account for an income tax debt owed by one of the joint bank account holders, because there is no authority to do so under section 157. 1 The High Court noted that the Social Security Act 1964 and the Child Support Act 1991 both contain deduction provisions that expressly refer to money held in joint bank accounts, whereas the Tax Administration Act 1994 does not. This raised an inference that a tax deduction provision like section 157 needed to contain an express reference to joint bank accounts for it to apply to such accounts. 1 ANZ Banking Group (New Zealand) Limited v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,643 37 The Child Support Act 1991 allows the Commissioner to require deductions from money payable to a liable parent to meet a child support debt. This deduction power extends to money held in joint bank accounts in the name of the liable parent and one or more other persons, when the liable parent can draw from that account without the signature of the other person. 38 CAP ON SHORTFALL PENALTIES (Clause 84) Summary of proposed amendment Section 141JAA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA) which caps some shortfall penalties is being clarified so that it does not apply if the taxpayer makes a disclosure at the time the tax position is taken (under section 141H). If the cap applied to disclosures made at the time of filing taxpayers could take tax positions that did not meet the standard of being “about as likely as not to be correct” knowing the maximum penalty they would face would be a penalty of $50,000. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Background Shortfall penalties can be reduced for different reasons. Under section 141G of the TAA a shortfall penalty is reduced by between 40% and 100% if it is voluntarily disclosed before the beginning of an audit. Under section 141H of the TAA a shortfall penalty for an unacceptable tax position or an abusive tax position is reduced by 75% if the taxpayer makes adequate disclosure of their tax position at the time they take their tax position. Under section 141JAA of the TAA a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care or an unacceptable tax position can be limited to $50,000 if the taxpayer voluntarily discloses their tax position or the Commissioner determines the shortfall, no later than the date that is the later of – • the date that is three months after the due date of the return to which the shortfall relates; and • the date that follows the due date of the return to which the shortfall relates by the lesser of – – one return period; and – six months. It is not clear that the limit in section 141JAA applies only to voluntary disclosures under section 141G and not to disclosures made under section 141H. It was never intended that section 141JAA apply to disclosures made at the time the tax position is taken (under section 141H), because if it applied to these disclosures taxpayers could take tax positions that did not meet the standard of being “about as likely as not to be correct” knowing the maximum penalty they would face would be a penalty of $50,000. 39 PIE CREDIT IMPAIRMENT PROVISIONS (Clauses 43, 51 and 91) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments are being made to the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules to ensure that multi-rate PIEs are able to claim deductions for credit impairment provisions. The amendments will also ensure that multi-rate PIEs have sufficient authority to claim deductions for expenses and pay tax for income when these are reflected in the PIE’s unit price or in its financial statements. The changes are intended to clarify uncertainty in the timing rules over when deductions can be made or income declared. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 October 2007. Key features The bill adds new sections HM 35B and HL 19B to the Income Tax Act 2007, and section HL 19B to the Income Tax Act 2004. These sections will clarify that multi-rate PIEs can claim deductions for expenses and pay tax for income at the point when they are reflected in the PIE’s unit price or its financial statements, even if this is before the PIE has legally incurred or derived the expenditure or income. The purpose of this timing rule is to maintain investor equity over time by ensuring that investors exiting a PIE are attributed their correct share of the PIE’s tax. Under this new timing rule, any future change in an expense or income that has already been deducted or taxed will also be picked up for tax purposes at the point when the change is reflected in the PIE’s unit price or financial accounts. These new sections also ensure that multi-rate PIEs are able to claim deductions for credit impairment provisions when they are reflected in the PIE’s unit price or its financial statements. Credit impairment provisions are created to reflect the decline in a financial asset’s value due to past events. A PIE will only be able to claim deductions for credit impairment provisions if it has objective evidence of a loss in an asset’s value because of events that have already occurred. Specifically, the criteria set out in NZ IAS 39 will need to be met in order for the PIE to make such a deduction. These amendments apply retrospectively from 1 October 2007. However, the bill includes transitional measures to confirm the tax positions already taken by multi-rate PIEs on the timing of income and expenses, as well as credit impairment provisions. These transitional measures prevent PIEs from making retrospective adjustments to their tax returns following these clarifications. 40 TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS CONCERNING THE APPROVED ISSUER LEVY (Clauses 79, 102 and 103) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces a number of amendments to the rules for the approved issuer levy (AIL) in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. The purpose of these amendments is to clarify the relationship between domestic law and treaty law for interest derived from New Zealand by foreign banks. The amendments will make clear that a borrower can pay AIL in order to qualify for an exemption under a double tax agreement. They will also ensure a better fit between terminology used in the relevant tax treaties and the arrangements whereby a borrower chooses to pay AIL under domestic law. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 August 2010. Key features A number of changes are being made to section 32M of the Tax Administration Act 1994: • As amended, subsection (1) will make clear that a borrower is eligible to elect to pay AIL for the purposes of an exemption under a double tax agreement, as well as for the purposes of the non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules. Subsection (2) will set out how the borrower elects to pay AIL in relation to a particular security, by either being or becoming an approved issuer, by applying to register the security, and by paying the levy for the security. • A person will become an approved issuer by giving notice to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) under subsection (2B). The Commissioner may revoke a person’s approved issuer status under subsection (3). By virtue of subsection (4B), such revocation applies from the date of notification under subsection (2B) if given with 20 working days of that date. This replaces the existing arrangements whereby a person must apply for approved issuer status but is deemed to have been granted such status unless notified by the Commissioner within 20 working days that their application has been declined. • Subsection (5) is being amended to introduce a reference to an exemption under a double tax agreement. Sections 86I and 86L of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 are also amended to introduce references to an exemption under a double tax agreement. 41 Background Recently concluded tax treaties with Australia and the United States include a new exemption from source-country tax for interest derived by banks. For interest derived from New Zealand, the availability of this exemption depends on the borrower paying AIL, unless the borrower is not eligible to elect to pay the levy, or there is no such levy, or the rate of the levy exceeds 2 percent of gross payments. The proposed amendments clarify the circumstances in which a person is eligible to pay AIL. They make clear that a borrower can pay AIL in order to qualify for an exemption under a double tax agreement, even if paying the levy makes no difference to the way the transaction is dealt with under domestic law. This will address uncertainty around the treatment of interest paid to foreign banks operating through a branch in New Zealand. Such interest is not subject to NRWT so the AIL mechanism is not relevant domestically, but the new treaty exemption could still apply if the loan was made from offshore instead of through the New Zealand branch. More generally, the amendments ensure a better fit between terminology used in the relevant tax treaties and the arrangements whereby a borrower chooses to pay AIL under domestic law. The new treaty provisions ask specifically whether the borrower is “eligible to elect to pay” AIL. The amendments will ensure that domestic law directly addresses this question. The amendments are intended to make the existing law more transparent, rather than substantively to alter its effect. It is therefore not considered necessary for the amendments to apply retrospectively. 42 APPLICATIONS FOR OVERSEAS DONEE STATUS (Clause 2 and 75) Summary of proposed amendment The bill amends the Income Tax Act 2007 to add the following three organisations to schedule 32: • The Branch Foundation. • The Mutima Charitable Trust. • The Bougainville Library Trust. This will enable donors to obtain tax credits on their donations to these overseas- focussed organisations. The Mutima Charitable Trust is to be granted donee status until the end of the 2016–17 tax year and the Bougainville Library Trust is to be granted donee status until the end of the 2018–19 tax year. The Income Tax Act 2007 is also being amended to reflect the name change of the Volunteer Service Abroad (Incorporated) to Te Tuao Tawahi: Volunteer Service Abroad Incorporated. Application date The application date is 1 April 2011 for the three organisations to be added to schedule 32. This means that donations made to these organisations after this date will be eligible for a tax credit. The approval of overseas donee status for The Mutima Charitable Trust and The Bougainville Library Trust is subject to a sunset clause as these organisations operate projects of a limited duration. At the end of this period these organisations will be removed from the schedule. The Mutima Charitable Trust is to be granted donee status until the end of the 2016–17 tax year and the Bougainville Library Trust until the end of the 2018–19 tax year. The application date for the name change of Volunteer Service Abroad will be from the date of enactment. Background Charities that apply some or all of their funds outside New Zealand must be approved for charitable donee status by Parliament. These organisations are listed in schedule 32 to the Income Tax Act 2007. 43 Donations to listed organisations entitle individual taxpayers to a tax credit of 33⅓% of the amount donated, up to the level of their taxable income, and for companies and Māori authorities, to a deduction for donations up to the level of their net income. The Branch Foundation is a fundraising body working for grassroots organisations on the Thai/Burma border. The Foundation enables local organisations, particularly in Thailand, to provide aid for those who have fled ethnic conflict in Burma. The main focus of the Foundation is to provide financial and logistical support to organisations working primarily with children displaced due to conflict. The Mutima Charitable Trust was established by a team of cardio-thoracic specialists from Christchurch Public Hospital. The aim of the Trust is to perform life-saving heart surgery on young adult Zambians who suffer from rheumatic heart disease. The Trust aims to have established a sustainable Zambian-based specialist cardio-thoracic unit after five years of operations, once local funding is in place and local staff have been trained. The Bougainville Library Trust was established to support the work of the Bougainville Heritage Foundation. The Trust’s aim is to act as a vehicle through which New Zealanders and the international community can contribute to, and support, the building and stocking of a library in Bougainville. 44 TREATMENT OF SUPERANNUATION SCHEMES ADMINISTERED BY THE NATIONAL PROVIDENT FUND (Clauses 2(9) and 37) Summary of proposed amendment A technical change is being made to section EY 11(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007 to clarify that the taxation rules for life insurance do not apply to superannuation schemes administered by the Board of Trustees of the National Provident Fund. The change ensures that the schemes administered by the Board and constituted under the various National Provident Fund Acts are not subject to the life insurance rules in the Income Tax Act. Application date The change will apply from 1 April 2010. Key features Section EY 11(5) is being clarified to ensure that superannuation schemes administered by the Board and constituted under various National Provident Fund Acts are not subject to the taxation rules for life insurance. Background Superannuation schemes administered by the Board are closed to new members and the benefits payable are subject to a government guarantee. The life insurance rules have application in the first instance to these schemes because they generally pay benefits that are contingent on the continuance of human life. The policy intent is that these schemes should be taxed as superannuation schemes. Most of the superannuation schemes administered by the Board are specifically removed from the scope of the life insurance taxation rules through the operation of sections EY 11(2) to (9). Section EY 11(5) has specific application to the schemes administered by the Board. Some National Provident Fund schemes are, however, excluded from the scope of section EY 11(5) on a legislative technicality based on whether the scheme received employer contributions. As a result, the life insurance rules have application to the affected schemes unless section EY 10(2) otherwise applies. The proposed amendment clarifies the operation of section EY 11(5) so that it does not distinguish between the different superannuation schemes that are administered by the Board. 45 AUCKLAND COUNCIL RESTRUCTURING (Clause 106) Summary of proposed amendment The bill amends section 83 of the Local Government (Auckland Transitional Provisions) Act 2010 which provides transitional tax relief on the amalgamation of Auckland local authorities into one Council. It provides that for the purposes of the financial arrangement rules in the Income Tax Act 2007, when the new Auckland Council enters into an acknowledgement of debt with a council-controlled organisation (CCO) without paying the principal to the CCO, the Auckland Council is deemed to have advanced the amount of the principal to the CCO. Application date The amendment will apply from 31 October 2010. Background On 1 November 2010, the existing Auckland local authorities will cease to exist and be replaced by the Auckland Council. As part of this restructuring, certain assets owned by existing local authorities will vest in CCOs owned by the new Auckland Council. For commercial reasons, the debt relating to those assets will not be transferred to the CCOs but will be assumed by the Auckland Council. In turn, the CCOs will enter into an acknowledgement of debt to the Council for the amount of the debt attributable to the assets. Under the process proposed, there will be no funds or other consideration actually flowing from the Auckland Council to the CCO in relation to the acknowledgement of debt. Detailed analysis The absence of consideration flowing from the Auckland Council to the CCO in relation to the acknowledgement of debt creates a problem under the financial arrangement rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. The general definition of “financial arrangement” in section EW 3(2) does not apply to the acknowledgement of debt because there is no consideration paid by the Council to the CCO. However, the debt is a financial arrangement because section EW 3(3)(a) applies. This provision captures all debts, regardless of whether the borrower receives consideration. Under the financial arrangement provisions, the difference between the amount received and the amount paid under a debt (generally the interest component) is deductible to the borrower and assessable income to the lender. Because there is no flow of funds from 46 the Auckland Council to the CCO under the acknowledgment of debt, the CCO will have a tax deduction for all amounts (interest and principal) paid under the debt and the Auckland Council will have assessable income of the same amount. To ensure that only interest (and not the principal) is deductible to the CCO and assessable to Auckland Council, the bill provides that Auckland Council will be deemed to have advanced the amount of the principal to the CCO. The amendment applies for the purposes of the financial arrangement rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. 47 TAX TREATMENT OF EMISSIONS TRADING UNITS (Clauses 22, 33 and 34) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are being made to the way that income is recognised following the free allocation of emissions units to the industrial and agricultural sectors under the emissions trading scheme. The new provisions require businesses to recognise income according to the business’s entitlement to receive emissions units for the income year. Previously, the rules would have required businesses to look at units they actually held, and recognised income on the basis of the units which were properly attributable to the current year. Application date The amendments apply from 1 July 2010, the date on which the industrial sector became subject to the ETS. Key features Section ED 1B is being extensively rewritten to provide new valuation rules for free units (zero-value units) that have been allocated and which the business holds at the end of the income year. Under the proposed rules, income arises from valuing an appropriate number of zero-value units at market value, and if necessary, supplementing that amount with the difference between the entitlement and the number of units held (see example 2). The starting point for the valuation of zero-value units is the entitlement to units which the business has for the income year. This is determined in accordance with the formulas in sections 83 and 84 of the Climate Change Response Act 2002. This calculation is made independently of the number of zero-value units which the business has been allocated for the relevant period, or which it actually holds at the end of it. The business may have already sold or surrendered some of the units it received for free. This number of units is deducted from the number of units required to be given a market value, as the sale and surrender processes give rise to income in their own right. The number of units remaining is the number of zero-value units held which are to be assigned a market value at the end of the year. In some instances the entitlement which the business is required to recognise will exceed the number of zero-value units which the business has on hand at the end of the year. If this happens, an additional sum of income will be recognised (see example 2) and be carried forward to apply against zero-value units received in the following year. In other instances the business may hold more zero-value units at the end of the year than it is required to recognise. If this happens, the surplus units will be carried forward at a zero value (see example 1). 48 Background Under the Climate Change Reform Act 2002, certain trade-exposed businesses are entitled to an allocation of emissions units. The basis of allocation was changed in 2009, and allocations are now calculated by reference to: • the level of assistance which applies to the business in the relevant emissions year; and • the business’s production output for the emissions year. Businesses will be allocated free emissions units, with an interim allocation being made early in the calendar year, and a square-up early in the following calendar year. The changes to the basis of allocation in 2009 required changes to the provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 which deal with the taxation consequences of the receipt of free emissions units. There are two basic issues which the current amendments deal with: • What is the appropriate amount of income for the business to recognise in the income year as a result of its entitlement to receive free units? • What value should the free units be recorded at in the business’s tax accounts? The following examples illustrate how the amended rules would work. Examples 1. Excess emissions units held A Ltd has a 31 December year-end. In February the Government transfers 150 emissions units to A Ltd. However, because of falling production, its entitlement for the year is only 100 units. It values 100 units at market value at year-end, and continues to hold the remaining 50 at a nil value. 2. Insufficient emissions units held B Ltd also has a 31 December year-end. In February the Government transfers 100 emissions units to B Ltd. However, because of increasing production, its entitlement for the year is 150 units. It values all 100 units at market value, and records an additional amount of income equal to 50 units x market value. 49 REWRITE ADVISORY PANEL AMENDMENTS The following amendments arise from recommendations of the Rewrite Advisory Panel’s following its consideration of submissions on the rewritten Income Tax Acts. The Panel monitors the working of the Income Tax Act 2007 (2007 Act) and the Income Tax Act 2004 (2004 Act) and reviews submissions on what may be unintended changes in the law as a result of its having been rewritten. The Panel recommends legislative action, when appropriate, to correct any unintended changes in law. Application date The following rewrite-related amendments apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year, unless otherwise stated. Key features Clause 23: Section CD 24(2)(a)(i): Returns of capital: on-market share cancellations (rewrite remedial item) The amendment corrects the cross-reference to section CD 29, to cross-refer instead to section CD 40. Clauses 24 and 88: Section CE 1 (2007 and 2004 Acts): Market value of benefit of accommodation (rewrite remedial item) The amendment to section CE 1 clarifies that: • for the market value of the benefit arising from accommodation to be income, it must arise in relation to an office or a position; • the amount of income is the measured by the market value of the benefit of accommodation; and • the market value of the benefit of accommodation allowances is included within the meaning of “accommodation”. This amendment applies from the beginning of the 2005-06 income year. Clause 40: Section FF 4(1)(a): Threshold for application of interest apportionment rule (rewrite remedial item) This provision contains an unintended change in law, which results in section FF 4(1)(a) of the 2007 Act incorrectly providing that a conduit tax relief company is required to perform a “thin-cap” interest allocation (deductible/non-deductible interest) if its conduit tax credits exceed $50,000, even if the relevant debt percentage in the foreign group is less than or equal to 66 percent. 50 The amendment corrects this unintended change to ensure that a conduit tax relief company is not required to make this “thin-cap” interest allocation if the company’s debt percentage in the foreign group is less than or equal to 66 percent. Clause 41: Section FO 18:Discharge of a financial arrangement on an amalgamation Section FO 18 applies, on an amalgamation of companies, to determine that financial arrangements are deemed to be discharged by the lender immediately prior to the amalgamation. However, section FO 18 contains an unintended change in law, which incorrectly results in the value treated as being given by an insolvent borrower to be at market value in all cases. The amendment ensures that, if an insolvent borrowing company is likely able to meet its financial obligations (for example, because property of the company fully secures the debt), the accrued value of the discharged financial arrangement is treated as being the amount of consideration given immediately prior to the amalgamation. Clauses 31, 32, 44–45, 47–50, 52–56, and 62: Subpart HM: Portfolio investment entities (rewrite remedial item) The amendments to sections HM 3, HM 5, HM 15, HM 23, HM 31, HM 35, HM 43, HM 47, HM 48, HM 61, HM 62, and consequential changes to sections DV 2, DV 5, and LS 4, clarify the circumstances in which the term “interests” is a reference to the defined term “investor interest”. Clause 46: Section HM 6(2)(b): Intended effects for multi-rate PIEs and investors (rewrite remedial item) The amendment corrects an unintended change in law in which section HM 6(2)(b) incorrectly provides that a portfolio investment entity (PIE) is liable for the income tax on investment returns for an investor who has elected to be “zero-rated” under the PIE rules. The amendment clarifies that a PIE does not have an income tax liability in relation to an investor who has elected to be “zero-rated” under the PIE rules. Clause 58: Section LC 4(1): Tax credits for transitional circumstances (rewrite remedial item) The amendment corrects the cross-reference to subpart MB, to cross-refer instead to subparts MD, ME, and MZ. Clause 60: Section LF 8(1): Credits for persons who are non-resident or receive exempt income (rewrite remedial item) An unintended change in law results in section LF 8(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 incorrectly preventing FDP credits from being refundable to tax-exempt shareholders (despite the heading to the provision referring to tax-exempt shareholders). The amendment ensures that FDP credits are refundable to exempt shareholders. 51 Clause 63: Section ME 1(2): Minimum Family Tax Credit (rewrite remedial item) This amendment corrects a printing error in section ME 1(2) of the 2007 Act, which inadvertently omitted the brackets around the expression “prescribed amount – net family scheme income”. The amendment reinserts the brackets. Clause 67: Sections OZ 7 to OZ 17: Memorandum accounts in a transitional period The amendment omits the references (following the text of the sections) to comparative provisions in the 2004 Act. Sections OZ 7 to OZ 17 provide transitional treatment for memorandum accounts in the transition of the company tax rate from 33% to 30%, effective from the commencement of the 2007 Act, and have no comparative provisions in the 2004 Act. Clause 68: Section RD 4(2): PAYE obligations when employer fails to withhold The amendment corrects an intended change in law that potentially results in an employee being liable for PAYE on their PAYE income payments (that is, salary or wages, extra pay or a schedular payment) if the employer had withheld PAYE from the PAYE income payment but not remitted the PAYE to Inland Revenue. The amendment ensures that an employee is liable to account for PAYE only if the employer has failed to withhold PAYE (in full or in part) at the time of paying a PAYE income payment. Clause 70: Section RD 22(2, (2B)): Returns for amounts of tax paid to Commissioner (rewrite remedial item) Section RD 22(2) contains an unintended change in law, which incorrectly requires an employer who remits PAYE to the Commissioner once a month to complete a form for the payment on both the 5th and 20th of the month. The amendment ensures that an employer who remits PAYE to the Commissioner once a month, need only complete the PAYE form on one occasion each month. Clauses 26, 27, 36, 38, 39, 42, 57, 59, 61, 72, 73, 74(3), 74(7): Section YA 1: Definition of “derived from New Zealand” The definition of “derived from New Zealand” is repealed because it has substantively the same effect as the term “source in New Zealand”. Provisions referring to the term “derived from New Zealand” are consequentially amended to refer to the term “source in New Zealand”. Clause 74(8): Section YA 1: Definition of “transfer of value” (rewrite remedial item) In paragraph (b)(ii) of the definition of “transfer of value”, the cross-reference to paragraph (a) is replaced by a cross-reference to paragraph (b)(i). This amendment ensures the 2007 Act definition of “transfer of value” is consistent with the definition of “transfer of value” in the 2004 Act. 52 Clauses 76 and 93: Schedule 51 (2007 Act) and Schedule 22A (2004 Act) The amendment relates to dividend and fringe benefit tax provisions which apply to low or nil interest loans applied to shareholder-employees. Under the Income Tax Act 1994, a shareholder-employee of a company could offset dividends derived from the company against the balance of a low or nil-interest loan if the dividend was assessable income but was not resident withholding income. In the 1994 Act, this offset was permitted by section CF 2(12)(b) (low interest loan was provided in the shareholder capacity) or by section CI 3(3)(b) (low interest loan provided in the employee capacity). The Rewrite Advisory Panel concluded that sections CD 28(9(b) and NE 1E(2) of the 2004 Act contain an unintended change in law in that they permit fully imputed dividends and exempt dividends to be offset against the balance of low or nil interest loans provided to a shareholder-employee, if the dividend was an exempt dividend paid to a shareholder of a qualifying company or if the dividend was a fully imputed dividend. Those changes were re-enacted in the 2007 Act as sections CD 39(9)(b) and RD 36(2) respectively. However, the Panel referred the matter to Policy Advice to consider retaining these drafting changes, on the basis that the outcomes are consistent with the policy. The policy intention is that shareholder-employees are able to reduce the balance of their low or nil-interest loans by applying their own funds in a reduction of the loan balance. This amendment confirms the drafting changes as intended changes, by amending the respective “intended changes in legislation” schedules in both of the 2004 and 2007 Acts. The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2005-06 income year. Tax Administration Act Clause 78(3): Section 3(1): Definition of “tax payable” The amendment places the definition of “tax payable” in the correct alphabetical order. Clause 80: Section 39(5): Consequential adjustments on change in balance date (rewrite remedial item) Section 39(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 contains an unintended change in law arising because, in the rewrite of Parts C, D, and E of the 2004 Act, the brackets in the formula were placed incorrectly. The amendment ensures that the average tax rate for the taxpayer is determined by reference to the taxable income the person would have by adjusting that income by the ratio of the number of days in the “change period” to the number of days in a normal tax year (365 days). Clause 82: Section 85F(3): Definition of “company” In the definition of company in section 85F(3), the cross-reference to the definition of “large budget screen production grant” is corrected to refer to the definition of “government screen production payment”. 53 Other legislation and regulations Clause 108: Health Entitlement Cards Regulations 1993 In the definition of “net income” in regulation 2, the cross-reference to section EX 37(2) and (3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 is corrected to refer to section EX 43(2) and (3) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

The main proposal is to extend the active income exemption that currently applies to offshore subsidiaries so that it also applies to joint ventures and other significant shareholdings in foreign companies. This will remove a barrier to offshore expansion by New Zealand businesses. In 2009 an active income exemption was introduced for foreign companies that are controlled by New Zealand investors (controlled foreign companies (CFCs)). This reform was designed to ensure that New Zealand businesses that expand offshore by operating subsidiaries in foreign countries can compete on an even footing with foreign competitors operating in the same country. This means that a New Zealand-owned manufacturing plant in China would generally face the same tax rate as other manufacturers operating in China. An “active business test” is used to reduce the tax and compliance costs associated with calculating and attributing small amounts of passive income. The test is passed and no income is attributed, if less than 5% of the gross income of the CFC is passive. If the test is failed, then only the passive income (i.e. highly mobile income such as interest, rent or royalties) is attributed to the shareholder. In 2007 some new methods were introduced for calculating income from less than 10% shareholdings in foreign companies (portfolio foreign investor funds (FIFs)). As a consequence, such investors generally calculate income based on an assumed 5% rate of return (fair dividend rate method), although a natural person and trustees of family trusts can choose to be taxed on the actual returns of all of their foreign portfolio investments (although any losses are reduced to zero). The 2007 and 2009 reforms did not apply to interests of between 10% and 50% in companies that are not controlled by New Zealanders (non-portfolio FIFs). Within this tranche some investors take an active role in managing the foreign company or invest in companies that are strategically aligned with their own business (akin to a CFC), while others will enter an investment based mainly on expected dividends and share gains (akin to a portfolio shareholding). The Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Bill (“the Bill”) aims to provide consistency of tax treatment between similar types of foreign investment. It achieves this by extending the active income exemption and active business test (with some small modifications) to non-portfolio FIFs. It also extends and rationalises the portfolio FIF reforms so that those investors who are unable to use the active income exemption (due to having an insufficient shareholding or access to information) will generally be taxed on an assumed 5% rate of return (fair dividend rate method). The main exception to these rules is for foreign companies that are located in Australia. The Bill replaces the grey list for non-portfolio FIFs with an exemption for non- portfolio FIFs that are resident and subject to tax in Australia. This is consistent with earlier reforms that replaced the eight-country “grey list” exemptions with an exemption for CFCs that are resident and subject to tax in Australia and with an exemption for ASX-listed companies. 4 EXTENDING THE ACTIVE INCOME EXEMPTION TO NON- PORTFOLIO FIFS (Clauses 7(2), 7(3), 8(2), 13, 14, 15(2), 16, 19(2), 25(3), 26(2), 29, 33, 35(2), 35(8), 35(9), 36 to 40, 42, 43, 69 70(3), 70(4), 72, 73, 97, subclauses 126(4), (9), (18), (20), (25), (27) and (30)) Summary of proposed amendments In 2009 an active income exemption was introduced for foreign companies that are controlled by New Zealand investors (CFCs). The Bill extends the active income exemption to interests of between 10% and 50% in companies that are not controlled by New Zealanders (non-portfolio FIFs). Application date The changes apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2011. Key features Under the existing rules investors in FIFs are able to calculate their income based on how the income would be calculated if the FIF were a branch of a New Zealand company (the branch equivalent method). The branch equivalent method will be replaced by the attributable FIF income method. Investors will only be able to use the attributable FIF income method in respect of FIFs in which they have a 10% or greater interest. Such investors will generally calculate their FIF income as though the FIF were a CFC using the active income exemption, although two modifications are made to make the CFC rules more accommodating to FIF investors. Firstly, the active business test is relaxed to enable FIF investors to use consolidated accounting information to apply the test to chains of FIFs (including FIFs that are in different jurisdictions). Secondly, the exemption that applies to payments of interest, rent and royalties from an active CFC to an associated CFC (e.g. 50% common ownership) is modified so that a similar exemption applies when a FIF holding company controls an active FIF. These modifications are explained in the detailed analysis below. Background New Zealand’s international tax rules can impose higher tax or compliance costs on offshore operations than those faced by competing businesses operating in the same country. In many cases a New Zealand business which invests into a foreign country needs to not only comply with the tax rules of that country, but also attribute income (and potentially pay further tax in New Zealand) using New Zealand tax concepts. In contrast, many other countries reduce or eliminate the additional tax or compliance burden created by a second layer of tax by exempting offshore income that is earned by active businesses (e.g. manufacturing, services and sales income). This may create an incentive for New Zealand companies undertaking or considering active business ventures outside New Zealand to relocate their headquarters to countries with more favourable tax rules. 5 In 2009 an active income exemption was introduced for foreign companies that are controlled by New Zealand investors (CFCs). The reform was intended to ensure that New Zealand businesses that expand offshore by operating subsidiaries in foreign countries could compete on an even footing with foreign competitors operating in the same country. This means that a New Zealand-owned manufacturing plant in China would generally face the same tax rate as other manufacturers operating in China. CFCs are a key vehicle for expanding New Zealand businesses beyond the domestic market. However, firms expand beyond New Zealand through a variety of structures, and New Zealand companies wanting to expand overseas may have good commercial reasons for not operating through a wholly or majority-owned subsidiary. For this reason the proposed Bill will allow investors with interests of between 10% and 50% in foreign companies that are not controlled by New Zealanders to apply the active income exemption to these FIF interests. Detailed analysis Attributable FIF income method (section EX 50) The branch equivalent method is replaced with an attributable FIF income method. Under this method investors in the FIF generally calculate their FIF income as though the FIF were a CFC using the active income exemption. No income is attributed from FIFs that satisfy the active business test, either independently or as part of a consolidated group of FIFs. Investors that do not satisfy the active business test attribute the portion of attributable income that corresponds with their income interest in the FIF (the investor’s income interest is also worked out by applying the CFC rules). The attributable FIF income method differs from the CFC rules in two key respects. Firstly, the active business test is relaxed to enable investors to use consolidated accounting information to apply the test to chains of FIFs (including FIFs that are in different jurisdictions). Secondly, the exemption that applies to payments of interest, rent and royalties from an active CFC to an associated CFC (e.g. 50% common ownership) is modified so that a similar exemption applies when a FIF holding company controls an active FIF. The remainder of this commentary focuses on these differences. A detailed description on how the CFC rules operate can be found in the October/November 2009 Tax Information Bulletin (Part II, Vol. 21, No. 8). Active business test (sections EX 21D, EX 21E and EX 50) An “active business test” is used to reduce compliance costs in cases where there is a low risk to the tax base. The test is passed and no income is attributed, if less than 5% of the gross income of the foreign company is passive. If the test is failed, then only the passive income (i.e. highly mobile income such as interest, rent or royalties) is attributed to the shareholder. 6 Under the CFC rules, New Zealand investors that have more than one majority-owned CFC in a jurisdiction are allowed to use consolidated accounts for all their majority- owned CFCs in that jurisdiction for the purposes of the active business test. The purpose of this measure is to simplify the application of the test when accounting information is available at a consolidated level, such as when a group produces segmental reporting by country. The Bill proposes a similar consolidation rule for investors in non-portfolio FIFs. This should enable more investors to use the active business test as it can be easier to access consolidated accounting information for an entire group of FIFs than to access information for each separate company. The requirements for being able to apply the active business test to a group of foreign companies under the attributable FIF income method are more relaxed than those that apply to a group of CFCs: • The CFC rules require the investor to have a more than 50% income interest in each CFC. Under the attributable FIF income method it is the FIF for which that method is used which must have a more than 50% voting interest in the lower-tier foreign companies. Voting interests include interests that are held directly or indirectly. • The CFC rules also require all the CFCs to be in the same jurisdiction in order to apply the active business test on a consolidated basis to a group of CFCs. Under the attributable FIF income method the foreign companies can be in different jurisdictions (so long as none of those companies is a CFC). • Finally, the CFC rules require the investor to remove amounts corresponding to income interests not held by the investor (i.e. minority interests). The attributable FIF income method omits this requirement so amounts belonging to other investors are included in the calculations. This concession is made purely because of concerns about the practical difficulties for a non-controlling shareholder of identifying amounts attributable to other shareholders. The above modifications to the CFC rules occur through new section EX 50(4B). Requirement to apply FIF calculation methods to lower-tier foreign companies (sections EX 50(6), EX 50(7) and EX 50(7B)) In many cases a New Zealand investor will own shares in a foreign company which itself owns shares in a second foreign company. If the investor chooses to use the attributable FIF income method in respect of the first foreign company, they will generally be required to “look-through” and to apply a FIF calculation method with respect to their indirect interest in the second foreign company. This is achieved by the formula in sections EX 50(6) and (7) and is consistent with the existing practice under the branch equivalent method. 7 Example If the NZ investor chooses to use the attributable FIF income method for FIF 1, it would generally have to apply a FIF calculation method to FIF 2 and FIF 4. If the investor then chooses to apply the attributable FIF income method to FIF 2, it would then generally have to apply a FIF calculation method to FIF 3. NZ investor FIF 1 FIF 2 FIF 3 FIF 4 20% 100% 60% 20% If the investor had instead decided to apply a different FIF calculation method (such as the fair dividend rate or cost methods) to FIF 1, then they would not be required to look-through and apply a FIF calculation method to FIFs 2, 3 or 4, as they only have an indirect interest in these FIFs. The Bill proposes several exceptions to the “look-through” rule in section EX 50(6). The purpose of these exclusions is to enable investors to apply the active business test using consolidated accounting information in situations where they have a direct interest in a FIF that holds shares in other foreign companies. In such cases it may be easier to access consolidated accounting information, than it would be to access separate accounting information for each company. Consider a New Zealand investor with an interest in a FIF that owns a second foreign company. The investor will have no additional FIF income from the second foreign company if: • The second foreign company is able to apply and pass the active business test on its own terms, independent from the upper-tier FIF. Note that the New Zealand investor would have to have an indirect interest of 10% or more in the second foreign company for that company to be able to apply the active business test in the first place; or 8 • The FIF and the second foreign company are able to apply and pass the active business test as part of the same test group. To be part of the same test group the FIF must hold a 50% or greater voting interest in the second foreign company, and the second foreign company must not be a CFC; or • The FIF is able to apply and pass the accounting-based active business test in section EX 21E even after some relevant amounts from the second foreign company are included in the “added passive” item. The relevant amounts will differ depending on the level of shareholding that the FIF has in the second foreign company. If the FIF holds a joint venture interest in the foreign company the amounts which would be recorded in that FIF’s accounts under New Zealand Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 31 (NZIAS 31) would need to be included. If the FIF holds 20% or more, but less than 50% of the foreign company, then amounts recorded under the equity method in that FIF’s accounts under NZIAS 28 would need to be included. If the FIF holds less than 20% of the foreign company then any dividends and holding gains recorded under NZIAS 39 for that company would need to be included. Note that including such amounts in the “added passive” item is optional, but the look-through rule will continue to apply to indirect FIF interests that do not qualify for one of the above exclusions. Example Consider the following group structure. NZ investor FIF 1 (UK) FIF 2 (UK) FIF 3 (France) FIF 4 (Germany) 30% 100% 60% 20% If the New Zealand investor chooses to apply the attributable FIF income method to FIF 1 it can apply the active business test using information from the consolidated accounts of FIF 1. Each line item in these accounts will include amounts from FIF 2 and FIF 3. These amounts will be included in the “reported passive” item for the purposes of the test. 9 Amounts from FIF 4 will be included as a separate line item (income from equity in associates) in the consolidated accounts of FIF 1. If the investor chooses to add this line item to the “added passive” item for applying the active business test to the test group and that test group still passes the active business test with these amounts included then the investor would not apply a FIF calculation method to FIF 4. Now assume that FIF 1 receives $400,000 of interest payments from FIF 2, $240,000 of royalty payments from FIF 3 and $100,000 in dividends from FIF 4. FIF 1 earns $5m of sales income and $200,000 in interest from unrelated entities. FIF 2 earns $2m of sales income, FIF 3 earns $3m of sales income and FIF 1 is entitled to 20% of the $1m earned by FIF 4. Because FIF 2 and FIF 3 are controlled by FIF 1 their earnings appear in full in the consolidated accounts. The intra-group royalty and interest payments are disregarded in the consolidated accounts. Income from FIF 4 comprises $200,000 of income from associates under the equity method (the dividend is not recognised in income and instead reduces the carrying value of the investment). The New Zealand investor chooses to apply the active business test using the consolidated accounts of FIF 1, FIF 2 and FIF 3 and by adding amounts from FIF 4 to the “added passive” item. Reported passive is $200,000 (third-party interest), added passive is $200,000 (from FIF 4) and total revenue is $10.4m, so the percentage of total passive to total revenue is 3.85%. Because this is less than 5% the New Zealand investor does not attribute any income from FIF 1, FIF 2, FIF 3, or FIF 4. All figures in $000s Consolidated accounts of FIF 1, FIF 2 and FIF 3 FIF 1 FIF 2 FIF 3 FIF 4 Income Sales 10,000 5,000 2,000 3,000 Less cost of goods sold 3,400 1,000 900 1,500 Gross profit 6,600 4,000 1,100 1,500 Other income Interest (400 from FIF 2) 200 600 0 0 Royalty (from FIF 3) 0 240 0 0 Income from equity in associates (FIF 4)200 200 0 0 Operating expenses Interest 0 0 400 0 Royalty payment 0 0 0 240 Net profit before tax 7,000 5,040 700 1,260 1,000 (of which 200 belongs to FIF 1) Active business test Reported Passive 200 Added Passive (from FIF 4) 200 Total Passive 400 Total Revenue 10,400 % Total Passive to Total Revenue 3.85% 10 Exemption for intra-group payments (sections EX 50(4B)(a), (b) and (c) and EX 50(4C)) In the event that the active business test is not satisfied for a particular FIF, and the holder of the FIF interest uses the attributed FIF income method to calculate attributed income, the method treats the FIF in many ways as a CFC. However, there are some key differences. Under the existing CFC rules there is an exemption for interest, rent and royalty payments between commonly-controlled CFCs, so long as both CFCs are in the same jurisdiction and the CFC that makes the payment is a non-attributing active CFC (i.e. passes the active business test). The Bill modifies the requirement for foreign companies that are not CFCs, so that a similar exemption applies when the recipient foreign company has more than 50% of the voting interests in the foreign company that makes the payment. For payments between CFCs, the requirement that the CFCs be associated companies is unchanged, but some changes have been made to “same jurisdiction” test (see commentary on attributed foreign income – liability to tax). Payments between FIFs will have to pass a similar “same jurisdiction” test in order for the exemption to apply. Example Interest, royalty and rent payments from FIF 2 to FIF 1 would normally be attributable income of FIF 1. However because FIF 1 and FIF 2 are in the same jurisdiction (the UK) and FIF 1 holds more than 50% of the voting interests in FIF 2, the payments would be excluded from the definition of attributable income. NZ investor FIF 1 (UK) FIF 2 (UK) 30% Interest, royalty or rent payment 100% 11 Amendment to definition of passive Telecommunications income Subsection EX 20B(3)(m)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 2007 deems certain telecommunications services income to be attributable income to the extent to which the equipment is owned by “the CFC or by another CFC that is associated with the CFC”. This subsection is amended so it also covers situations where a CFC (or a FIF using the attributable FIF income method) is associated with a (second) FIF or CFC. In the absence of this change it would be possible to reduce a foreign company’s attributable income by dealing with an associated foreign company that is not a CFC. 12 RATIONALISING OTHER FIF CALCULATION METHODS (Clauses 8(2), 15(2), 25(1), 25(2), 26(1), 26(3) to (7), 27, 28, 30, 33, 35(1), 35(3), 35(4), 35(5), 35(6), 36(7), 35(8), 35(10), 36 to 40, 42, 62, subclauses 126(2), (6)and (7), and clause 131) Summary of proposed amendments Investors who are unable to use the active income exemption (due to having a less than 10% shareholding or insufficient access to information) will use the rules that were developed for portfolio FIFs. To achieve this, the fair dividend rate and cost methods will be available to most FIF interests and not just those that are a less than 10% interest. Investors will only be able to choose to use the comparative value method if they are a natural person or a trustee of a family trust. In addition, the accounting profits and branch equivalent methods will be repealed. Investors with non-ordinary shares (i.e. shares that are economically equivalent to debt) will apply the comparative value method in cases where an end of year market value is available and the deemed rate of return method in cases where it is not. Application date The changes apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2011. Key features Under the existing FIF rules sections EX 46 and EX 62 limit an investor’s choice of calculation method and their ability to change from a method they are currently using. The Bill reforms these rules so that the fair dividend rate and cost methods will be available to most FIF interests and not just those that are a less than 10% interest. Investors will only be able to choose to use the comparative value method if they are a natural person or a trustee of a family trust. Non-portfolio investors will generally be able to change to the fair dividend rate or cost method in respect of their first income year beginning on or after 1 July 2011. Background In 2007 some new methods were introduced for calculating income from less than 10% shareholdings in foreign companies (portfolio FIFs). As a consequence, such investors calculate income based on an assumed 5% rate of return (fair dividend rate method), although natural persons and trustees of family trusts can choose to be taxed on the actual returns of all of their foreign portfolio investments (although any losses are reduced to zero). 13 These new methods were limited to FIF interests of less than 10%. In cases where the investor cannot use the active income exemption, it makes sense to tax foreign investments consistently. Accordingly, it is proposed that all investors who are unable to use the active income exemption for FIFs (due to having a less than 10% shareholding or insufficient access to information) will use the rules that were introduced in 2007 for portfolio FIFs. Detailed analysis Fair dividend rate and cost methods The fair dividend rate and cost methods will no longer be limited to FIF interests of less than 10%. The Bill aims to achieve this by removing subsection EX 46(7)(a) and subsection EX 46(9)(a). If a person does not choose a calculation method (and is not required to use a certain method), they are deemed to have chosen to use the fair dividend rate method, or the cost method if it is not practical to use the fair dividend rate method. This is achieved by changes to the default calculation methods in section EX 48. Proposed repeal of accounting profits method The Bill proposes that the accounting profits method be repealed with application from an investor’s first income year beginning on or after 1 July 2011. Persons who used the accounting profits method in the year preceding the repeal of this method would be able to change to any other method (see new subsection EX 62(2)(a)), subject to the limits on the choice of method in section EX 46. Comparative value method Investors will only be able to choose the comparative value method if: a) the interest is a non-ordinary share under subsection EX 46(10); or b) if they are a natural person or a trustee of a family trust and do not use the fair dividend rate or cost method for any of their other interests. This simply reflects the existing limitations on choosing the comparative value method under the portfolio FIF rules. The Bill aims to achieve this by removing subsection EX 46(6)(c) (which prevented the above limitations from applying to FIF interests of 10% or more). Where a person chooses to use the comparative value method for one FIF interest they will not be able to use the fair dividend rate method or cost method for their other FIF interests. This result is achieved by existing section EX 46(8)(b). Note that an investor would be required to use the comparative value method if they have a “non-ordinary share” (share that is equivalent to debt) as defined in section EX 46(10) and it is practical to get an end of year market value for that share. Subsection EX 46(6)(d) already achieves this. 14 Investors will only be able to get a loss for an entire portfolio under the comparative value method if they have a non-ordinary share. Other losses for an entire portfolio using the CV method will be treated as zero income. The removal of subsection EX 51(7)(a) achieves this result. Deemed rate of return method Under the proposed rules investors will only use the deemed rate of return method when they have a non-ordinary share and it is not practical to get an end of year market value for that share. This is achieved through the repeal of section EX 46(4) and amendments to section EX 46(5). Now that non-portfolio investors can use the fair dividend rate and cost methods (which apply tax to an assumed 5% return), it is no longer necessary to allow taxpayers to choose to use the deemed rate of return method as this applies tax at a higher than 5% return. Limits on choice of calculation method (section EX 46) The following diagram summarises the main limitations that would apply to an investor’s choice of calculation method under the proposed amendments. Note the diagram does not include the rules in section EX 62 which limit an investor’s ability to change from a method that they are currently using to a different method. Changes to section EX 62 are described below. Start Interest is 10% or more and investor is not a PIE? (section EX 46(3)) Interest in a CFC? (section EX 1) Interest is 10% or more and investor is not a PIE? (section EX 14) Use CFC attribution method Non-ordinary share? (section EX 46(10)) Know market value? (section EX 47) Use CV method Use DRR method Want attributable FIF income method and have data? Use attributable FIF income method Know market value? (section EX 46(i)(b)) Investor is a natural person or trustee of family trust? (section EX 46(6)) Use cost method Have chosen CV for other FIF interests? (section EX 46(8)) Use CV method Use FDR method Want FDR? Yes No 15 Limits on changes of method (section EX 62) In general, once investors start to use a calculation method for a FIF interest they are required to continue using the same calculation method. Section EX 62 supports this approach by providing a set of rules that limit an investor’s ability to change from a FIF calculation method that they are currently using to a different FIF calculation method. The Bill proposes several changes to this section to reflect the changes to the available calculation methods. The limits on the choice of method under section EX 46 also apply when changing a method. A proposed amendment to section EX 62(2)(a) would allow investors who used the accounting profits method in the year preceding the repeal of this method to change to any other method (see new subsection EX 62(2)(a)). A proposed amendment to section EX 62(2)(c) would allow investors to switch from the comparative value method when it is impossible to find out the end of year market value of the interest or if they are prevented from using it because they are not a natural person or a trustee of a family trust or using it in respect of a non-ordinary share (i.e. section EX 46(6) prevents them from using it). A new provision is proposed after section EX 62(9) that would allow investors to change to the fair dividend rate method (and by implication also the cost method) from the accounting profits method, the branch equivalent method or deemed rate of return method in respect of their first income year beginning on or after 1 July 2011. This reflects the fact that the accounting profits and branch equivalent methods have been repealed and the deemed rate of return method will only be used in the case of non- ordinary shares where it is not practical to get an end of year market value for the share. A proposed amendment to section EX 62(6) would allow investors to change from the branch equivalent method to the attributable FIF income method. It would also allow investors to change to or from the attributable FIF income method on one occasion (not counting the initial change from branch equivalent method to attributable FIF income method). An investor will only be able to change to or from the attributable FIF income method a second time if there has been a change in circumstances that significantly changes their ability to obtain enough information to use the attributable FIF income method and if altering their income tax liability is not the principal purpose or effect of the change (section EX 62(7)). This is consistent with the existing restriction on changing to or from the branch equivalent method. 16 PIES WITH NON-PORTFOLIO INTERESTS IN CFCS OR FIFS (Clauses 7(1), 9(2), 12, 18, 23 and 26(2)) Summary of proposed amendments Proposed amendments will deem all CFC interests held by a portfolio investment entity (PIE) to not be CFC interests. Note this will not mean that the foreign company would stop being a CFC, it just means the PIE will use the FIF rules as opposed to the CFC rules. A similar amendment will prevent PIEs from using the attributable FIF income method. Application date The changes would apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2011. Key features Under proposed amendments to sections EX 14 and EX 34 an investor would only have a CFC interest if they have a 10% or more interest in the controlled company and if they are not a PIE. If they are a PIE they will have an ordinary (non-CFC) FIF interest in the company. Proposed amendments to section EX 46 would prevent a PIE from using the attributable FIF income calculation method. A proposed amendment to section CW 9 will prevent all PIEs from accessing the foreign dividend exemption (currently only multi-rate PIEs are excluded from this exemption). Note that PIEs will not actually be taxed on foreign dividends as they will be treated as only having FIF income from their FIFs (see section EX 59(2)). Background The interaction of the PIE rules and the active income exemption rules can lead to individuals who invest through a PIE being treated differently to other individual investors. If PIEs were able to access the active income and foreign dividend exemptions they would be able to pass foreign income through to their members with no New Zealand tax. In contrast, New Zealand tax would be payable in cases where a non-PIE company distributed untaxed foreign income. Under the existing rules, PIEs can hold a 10-20% interest in a CFC (that is not a foreign PIE equivalent). In such cases they are required to apply the active income exemption to such interests. However, if the investors in the PIE held their share of the CFC directly, they would usually be required to use a FIF calculation method (as an interest of less than 10% in a CFC is not a CFC interest). 17 PIEs that have a 10% or greater interest in a CFC or FIF should not be considered to have a CFC interest, should not be able to use the attributable FIF income method to access the active income exemption, and should not be able to use the dividend exemption in section CW 9. 18 REPLACING THE GREY LIST EXEMPTION WITH AN AUSTRALIAN EXEMPTION (Clauses 5, 8(1), 9(1), 15(1), 19(1), 24, 31, 32 and 34) Summary of proposed amendments The exemption for rights of 10% or more in FIFs that are resident in one of eight grey list countries is replaced with an exemption for rights of 10% or more in FIFs that are resident and subject to tax in Australia and that do not receive certain Australian tax concessions. Application date The proposed changes would apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2011. Key features Under the changes proposed in the Bill, the section EX 35 exemption will require an investor to have a direct income interest of 10% or more in a FIF that is resident and subject to tax in Australia. The FIF must not have had its liability for Australian tax reduced by an exemption related to income earned outside of Australia or from the concession for offshore banking units. The new provision is designed to accommodate cases where the FIF is not technically subject to tax in Australia because it is taxed as part of an Australian consolidated group in such a way that the head company pays tax on behalf of the FIF. The exemption in section EX 35 does not apply to investments held by portfolio investment entities, superannuation schemes, unit trusts, life insurers or group investment funds. This is consistent with the exclusions from the existing grey list exemption. Background As part of last year’s CFC reforms the exemption for CFCs located in eight grey list countries was replaced with an exemption for CFCs that are resident and subject to tax in Australia. (Section EX 22) Consistent with this change, the Bill replaces the remaining grey list exemption for FIFs with an exemption for FIFs that are resident and subject to tax in Australia. 19 Branch equivalent tax accounts of companies and conduit tax relief accounts 21 REPEAL OF BRANCH EQUIVALENT TAX ACCOUNTS OF COMPANIES AND CONDUIT TAX RELIEF ACCOUNTS (Clauses 4, 6, 10, 11, 52, 59 to 61, 63, 65, 67, 68, 75 to 96, 98, 100 to 102, 104 to 111, 113 to 115, 117 to 125, subclauses 126(5), (8), (10), (12) to (15), (17), (19), (22), (23), (26), (28) and (31) to (33), and clauses 127, 128, 130, 133 to 135 and 137 to 139) Summary of proposed amendment The Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 made major changes to the tax treatment of foreign investments. Those changes made branch equivalent tax accounts of companies (BETAs) and conduit tax relief accounts (CTRAs) obsolete. However, the government at the time announced that these memorandum accounts would be retained for a transitional period of two years, to allow the use of remaining BETA debits (to prevent double-taxation of foreign income) and the distribution of conduit-relieved income (to prevent the dilution of foreign dividend payment credits). This Bill proposes provisions to remove the BETAs and CTRAs at the end of the relevant period, and to repeal associated provisions and references. Application date The proposed repeal of BETAs and related provisions applies, for most provisions, from the beginning of the fourth income year the taxpayer is under the new international tax rules (that is, the first income year beginning on or after 1 July 2012). A restriction on elections to use BETA debit balances, limiting the use to relieving tax on attributed foreign income that is allocated to the second year under the international tax rules or to an earlier year, would apply from the first income year beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The proposed repeal of CTRAs and related provisions would apply from the beginning of the first income year beginning on or after 1 July 2011. Key features BETAs will be repealed after three years under the new international tax rules passed in 2009, but debit balances will be able to be used to relieve tax on attributed foreign income only where that income is allocated to the second year under the new rules or to an earlier year. BETAs remain for the third year only to allow determination of income and filing of returns for the second year. CTRAs will be repealed after two years under the new international tax rules. Dividends not paid before that date will not be able to have conduit tax credits attached to them. 22 Detailed analysis All references in this part of the Commentary are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless noted. Branch equivalent tax accounts (BETAs) of companies Branch equivalent tax accounts of companies are being phased out. Branch equivalent tax accounts of individuals (non-companies) are unaffected. Paragraph FM 6(3)(d) Proposed repeal of this paragraph along with BETA accounts of companies. Dividends between companies in a consolidated group are normally ignored, but are still taken into account for the purposes of the rules relating to BETAs. Once BETAs of companies cease to exist, this paragraph will become redundant. Section GB 40 Proposed repeal of this section. Arrangements to avoid continuity restrictions on BETA account balances will cease to be relevant when BETA account balances are repealed. Arrangements affecting balances prior to repeal will still be caught, since the section applied at the time. Paragraphs OA 2(1)(d), 5(5)(a), 5(5)(c), 6(5)(a), 6(5)(c), sub-paragraphs OA 7(2)(d)(i) and (ii), paragraphs OA 8(6)(c) and (g) Proposed repeal or alteration of these provisions. With the repeal of BETAs of companies from the first income year beginning on or after 1 July 2012, no further credits or debits will arise in the accounts and there will not be any balances in the accounts. No further BETA debits will be used by companies to meet tax liabilities. Section OA 9, paragraphs OA 10(1)(d) and 10(3)(c), subsection OA 14(6), and paragraphs OA 15(1)(c) and 15(3)(c) Proposed repeal or alteration of these provisions. If an amalgamating company has a BETA, BETA debits and credits have to be transferred across to the BETA of the amalgamated company. The requirement to transfer the credits will no longer be necessary if either the amalgamating or amalgamated company has no BETA account. Paragraph OB 4(3)(h) Proposed repeal of this provision. From the beginning of the first income year beginning on or after 1 July 2012, a company will not be able to make an election to use a BETA debit balance to meet an income tax liability. In addition, even if it makes an election prior to that date, it will not be able to make the election in respect of a tax liability for income relating to an income year beginning on or after 1 July 2011. Paragraph (h) will therefore be redundant. 23 Subsections OE 7(3) and OP 101(2) When the repeal of BETAs of companies was announced, the government said that there would be a two-year transitional period during which existing debit balances could continue to be used. That is, companies will still be able to reduce their tax liability for attributed foreign income earned in the first two income years following application of the new income tax rules. Because the amount of income for the second year will not be known immediately, it will be impractical to make elections to use BETA debit balances before the end of the second year. For that reason, BETAs will remain for a third year. New requirements have been introduced in sections OE 7 and OP 101 to prevent elections to use BETA debits unless: • the election is made before the end of the third income year; and • the election relates to a tax liability for attributed foreign income that has been allocated to the second year or to an earlier year. These requirements apply retrospectively from the date of application of the new international tax rules. Subsections OE 1(1) and (3), sections OE 2 to OE 4, OE 6 to OB 16B, OP 97 to OP 98, OP 100 to OP 104B and OP 108B It is proposed to repeal these provisions, which impose requirements on BETA companies to keep BETAs and make appropriate entries in them, with effect from the first income year beginning on or after July 2012. The BETA regime for companies and requirements to keep such accounts will be no longer required from that date. Accounts must still be kept for the final year of the BETAs, even if only a part tax year because of the repeal (BETAs always have a 31 March “balance” date, which may not correspond to the end of an income year). Relevant information must also be provided in an imputation credit account (ICA) return for the final year, and records must continue to be kept for the normal record-keeping period (see commentary on changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994, below). Subsection OE 5 This provision is modified to apply only to BETA accounts of individuals, following the repeal of the rules for companies. Section OZ 16 It is proposed to repeal this provision at the same time as BETAs of companies. This was a transitional provision to reduce remaining balances in BETAs following changes to the corporate tax rate in Budget 2010. 24 Sub-paragraph YC 17(12)(b)(iii) and subsection YC 18B(3) It is proposed to repeal or modify these provisions to remove redundant references to BETAs. Paragraph 22(2)(f) and subsection 22(7) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 References to BETA accounts will be redundant from the time those accounts are repealed, so are being removed. Records for periods when BETA accounts were in existence are still required to be kept – that requirement arose before repeal. Paragraph 69(1)(e) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 It is proposed to repeal this paragraph. BETA information of companies will no longer have to be included in the annual ICA return under this section, once returns have been completed for the tax years up and including the year during which BETAs were repealed. It is possible that the BETA will not exist for the entire tax year in the year BETAs are repealed. Nevertheless, under the existing provision, it is still required to include relevant BETA information in the ICA return (the person was a BETA company during the tax year). Section 77 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 It is proposed to repeal this provision. The provision previously required an amended annual ICA return if a retrospective election to be a BETA company was made, to ensure a complete record of BETA transactions would be returned. It will not be possible to make elections to become a BETA company from the beginning of the income year beginning on or after 1 July 2012, retrospective or not. Since an ICA return must already (under paragraph 69) be provided for any tax year falling wholly or partly within the last income year for which a BETA exists, section 77 is now redundant. Conduit tax relief accounts Sections CW 11 and HA 17 It is proposed to repeal section CW 11. Dividends that are fully credited for conduit tax relief will no longer be exempt income of conduit tax relief holding companies if they are paid later than the beginning of the first income year of the recipient beginning on or after 1 July 2011. There are a number of consequential amendments to remove references to section CW 11 in other provisions. Section FE 21(12)(a)(iii) It is proposed to repeal this section. It will neither be possible for companies to attach conduit tax relief credits to dividends, nor to be conduit tax relief holding companies, from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2011. This makes section FE(12)(a)(iii) redundant from the beginning of that income year. 25 Section GZ 2 It is proposed to repeal section GZ 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which is an anti- avoidance rule, on the same date as CTRAs. After the repeal of CTRAs, this section becomes redundant and its removal from the Act therefore aids clarity. The rule in section GZ 2 was enacted to prevent people running up CTRA credit balances in anticipation of them being cancelled under the new international tax rules, and then effectively directing tax-relieved income to residents. The rules apply to an arrangement involving transactions that occurred between the date on which repeal of conduit accounts was announced and the enactment of the international tax rules, after which further conduit tax relief was prevented. The anti-avoidance rule will still apply to such arrangements even after repeal of section GZ 2. The rule still applies because the arrangement was entered into before the repeal and the rule would have applied at that time, triggering the imposition of additional income tax. Section HG 2(4)(c) It is proposed to repeal this section. This provision states that partnerships are not subject to the “no streaming” rules in subsection HG 2(2) in respect of CTR additional dividends. However, there will be no such dividends paid in any income year beginning on or after 1 July 2011. Section LQ 5 It is proposed to repeal this section. Since conduit tax credits will no longer be attached to dividends by a company in any income year beginning on or after 1 July 2011, CTR additional dividends will not be payable by the company from that time either. Paragraph OA 2(1)(c), subsections 5(4) and 6(4), paragraph OA 7(2)(c), and subsections OA 8(5) and 18(1) It is proposed to repeal these paragraphs and subsections. With the repeal of CTRAs from the first income year beginning on or after 1 July 2011, no further credits or debits will arise in the accounts and there will not be any balances in the accounts. No further CTR credits will be attached to dividends. Paragraphs OA 10(1)(c), 10(3)(b), subsection OA 10(4) and paragraphs OA 15(3)(b), OB 24(3)(c) and OB 53(3)(c) It is proposed to repeal or alter these paragraphs. At one time, if an amalgamating company had a CTRA but the amalgamated company did not, CTR credits were to be converted to imputation credits and FDP was to be paid. The requirement to transfer the credits ceased when the new international tax rules came into force. 26 Sections OC 19 and OP 70 These sections are being repealed at the same time as CTRAs cease. They allow for a transfer from a CTRA to a foreign dividend payment memorandum account in certain circumstances. With no CTRA, such transfers will no longer be possible. Subpart OD and sections OP 78 to 80, OP 83 to 87, OP 89 to 94 and OP 96 The subpart and sections, which impose requirements on CTR companies to keep CTRAs and make appropriate entries in them, are being repealed with effect from first income year beginning on or after July 2011. From that time, there will be no CTRAs to meet requirements for. Accounts must still be kept for the final year of the CTRAs, even if only a part tax year because of the repeal (CTRAs always have a 31 March “balance” date, which may not correspond to the end of an income year). Relevant information must also be provided in an ICA return for the final year, and records must continue to be kept for the normal record-keeping period (see commentary on changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994, below). Section OZ 17 It is proposed to repeal this provision at the same time as CTRAs. This was a transitional provision to reduce remaining credit balances in CTRAs following changes to the corporate tax rate in Budget 2010. Paragraphs RF 8(1)(c) and (f), subsections RF (9)(1), 9(6) and (7), paragraph RF 10(3)(a), subsection RF 10(4), paragraph RF 10(5)(e) and subsection RF 10(7) It is proposed to repeal these paragraphs at the same time as CTRAs, since it will no longer be possible to attach CTR credits to dividends or to pay a CTR additional dividend. Sections YD 9 to YD 11 It is proposed to repeal these sections at the same time as CTRAs. A CTRA holding company must be a CTR company, so these provisions will become redundant once CTRAs are repealed. Paragraph 22(2)(k) and sections 29, 30A and 68A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 References to CTR accounts or to CTR credits will be redundant from the time those accounts are repealed and CTR credits can no longer be attached to dividends, so it is proposed to remove these references. 27 Paragraph 69(1)(f) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 It is proposed to repeal this paragraph. CTRA information will no longer have to be included in the annual ICA return under this section, once returns have been completed for the tax years up and including the year during which CTRAs were repealed. It is possible that the CTRA will not exist for the entire tax year in the year CTRAs are repealed. Nevertheless, under the existing provision, it is still required to include relevant CTRA information in the ICA return (the person was a CTR company during the tax year). 28 REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS: BRANCH EQUIVALENT TAX ACCOUNTS OF COMPANIES (Clauses 99, 103, 112 and 116) Summary of proposed amendment Minor changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 are included in this Bill to ensure that branch equivalent tax accounts (BETAs) cannot go into credit. Application date Income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. Key features Following the changes in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009, all credit balances in branch equivalent tax accounts of companies (BETAs) were cancelled. However, debit balances remained for a transitional period of two years. As these debit balances are used, credits are put into the account to cancel them out. Minor changes to the rules are included in this Bill to ensure that BETAs cannot go back into an overall credit balance as a result of these credits. Credits arising under sections OE 6, OE 9, OP 100 and OP 103 are now limited to the amount of an overall debit balance in the account at the time. 29 Changes to the thin capitalisation regime 31 APPLYING THE THIN CAPITALISATION RULES TO ACTIVE FIFS (Clauses 44, 45(1), 45(2), 46(3), 47(4)) and 56) Summary of proposed amendments The Bill modifies the thin capitalisation rules that apply to investors with CFCs so that these also apply to investors in FIFs that use the attributable FIF income method (i.e. active income exemption) or the section EX 35 Australian exemption. In the absence of such rules there could be an incentive for businesses to reduce their taxable income by stacking additional debt against their New Zealand operations when in fact they are using these funds to equity finance their exempt offshore investments. Application date The proposed changes would apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2011. Key features Amendments are proposed to the thin capitalisation rules so that investors using the attributable FIF income method, or that use the exemption for FIFs resident in Australia, are subject to the same thin capitalisation rules that currently apply to investors in CFCs. More specifically, the amendments to outbound thin capitalisation rules would apply to New Zealand residents with CFCs or with FIFs for which they use the attributable FIF income method or New Zealand residents that use the section EX 35 exemption for FIFs resident in Australia. Assets from these entities will be included in the worldwide group assets but not in the New Zealand group’s assets for the purposes of determining if the New Zealand group’s debt to asset ratio is below 110% of the worldwide ratio (in which case there is no denial of interest deductions). Background One fiscal risk with the active income exemption is that it can create an incentive for businesses to reduce their taxable income by stacking additional debt against their New Zealand operations when in fact they are using these funds to equity finance their exempt offshore investments. This concern was addressed for CFCs through the use of thin capitalisation rules which limit the amount of New Zealand debt to 75% of the investor’s New Zealand assets. A similar risk arises in respect of investors in FIFs that use the active income exemption. The Bill amends the thin capitalisation rules so that they also apply to investors in FIFs that use the active income exemption or the Australian exemption. 32 NEW THIN CAPITALISATION TEST FOR LOW-ASSET COMPANIES (Clauses 47(1), 47(3), 47(5), 48, 49 and 136) Summary of proposed amendment A new thin capitalisation test is proposed for certain New Zealand-based groups with offshore investments. This will give certain New Zealand taxpayers an alternative test to comply with the thin capitalisation rules. Where New Zealand multinational groups have a high level of arm’s length debt, and if certain other conditions are met, they can choose that the test for thin capitalisation be based on a ratio of interest expenses to pre- tax cash flows, rather than on a debt-to-asset ratio. Note that further changes to the thin capitalisation rules are associated with the extension of the active income exemption for controlled foreign companies to non- controlling interests. Those changes are discussed in the previous section of this commentary. Application date For income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. This measure would apply retrospectively so that companies that may have experienced difficulties immediately after the extension of the thin capitalisation rules will be able to obtain relief. Key features A new thin capitalisation test is proposed for certain New Zealand-based multinationals. The test is available to such a group if: • the worldwide debt of the multinational is more than 75% of its worldwide assets (excluding any recognised goodwill); and • at least 80% of the worldwide group’s debt is from lenders that are not associated with a member of the group; and • the New Zealand part of the multinational group and the worldwide group both have net income and net interest expenses (not net losses or net interest income). The test is not available to entities that are non-residents or controlled by a single non- resident. When the alternative test may be used, the taxpayer will calculate a ratio of net interest expense to net income, rather than the debt-to-asset ratio used under the existing test. 33 To the extent that the ratio for the New Zealand group is less than the minimum of: • 50%; and • 110% of the ratio for the worldwide group; there will be no denial of interest deductions under the rules. To the extent these conditions are not met, interest deductions will be denied. Detailed analysis All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless stated. Background The thin capitalisation rules, which limit excessive interest deductions against the New Zealand taxable income of multinationals, were extended in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009. Prior to the extension, they applied only to non-residents and residents controlled by non-residents. After the extension, they also applied to other taxpayers with controlling interests in foreign companies. As part of the Bill, the rules will be further extended to some taxpayers with non-controlling interests in foreign companies (see commentary on applying the thin capitalisation rules to active FIFs). The extension of the rules has created difficulties for a small number of New Zealand- based groups reported to have high indebtedness. The rules currently deny interest deductions if a group has a New Zealand debt-to-asset ratio that is both more than 75% and more than 110% of the worldwide debt-to-asset ratio of the group (that is, if debt appears to be concentrated in New Zealand). The problem arises partly from the way assets are measured. Measurement is based on generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP). GAAP does not allow the recognition of some intangible assets, such as internally developed goodwill. Companies that have highly valuable brands, for example, cannot include those in the measure of assets unless they were purchased on the open market. This increases the debt-to-asset ratio and increases the potential for interest deductions to be denied. A New Zealand company with valuable brands that looks to expand offshore by taking on debt may therefore find itself subject to the thin capitalisation rules, even though it is not unreasonably arranging to have its debts in New Zealand. There are good reasons for the exclusion of internally developed goodwill and some other intangible assets from the GAAP measure of assets. Primarily, it can be extremely difficult to value intangible assets if there has not been an arm’s-length transaction. However, in cases where a company has significant intangible assets that cannot be counted, it is possible that a debt-to-asset ratio will be a misleading measure in terms of whether excessive debt has been stacked in New Zealand. 34 Alternative test To address the problem some New Zealand-based groups are facing, a new test has been developed as an alternative to the existing test based on the debt-to-asset ratio. It uses a measure that approximates an interest coverage ratio (interest-to-cash-flows). Arm’s- length lenders may be prepared to lend against cash flows even when recognised assets are low (interest coverage is often used in lending covenants). Requirements for use of alternative test Paragraph FE 5(1B)(aa) An excess debt outbound entity is, broadly speaking, a person who is subject to the thin capitalisation rules solely by reason of a direct or indirect outbound investment from New Zealand. This paragraph provides that an excess debt outbound entity is not required to apply the existing thin capitalisation rule in section FE 6, if it is able to choose and does choose to apply the alternative rule in section FE 6B. Subsection FE 5(1BB) This subsection provides that a person is able to choose the alternative rule in section FE 6B if the following four requirements are all met: • Both the New Zealand group and the worldwide group of the person must have a positive amount of adjusted net profit for the year (adjusted net profit is further defined in subsection FE 5(1BC) and is determined mainly using financial accounts). • Both the New Zealand group and the worldwide group of the person must have a positive amount of net interest expense, determined using the rules in the Income Tax Act as if there were no thin capitalisation rules, as if the relevant members of the worldwide group were residents, and as if the group were consolidated to eliminate internal balances and transactions (see commentary on section FE 12B). • The worldwide group’s debt-to-asset ratio, excluding any recognised goodwill but otherwise determined using the existing thin capitalisation rules, must be 75% or more. • 80% or more of the worldwide group’s debt (calculated in the normal way under the thin capitalisation rules) must be from people that are not associated persons of a member of the group. The first two requirements are to prevent distortion when the formula in section FE 6B is applied. The third requirement is that the worldwide group is highly indebted if all of its intangible assets are disregarded. If the group is not highly indebted in this circumstance, the existing test is more likely to work (it is less likely to be difficult for the company to push some debt offshore, for example). The fourth requirement is to ensure that most of the debt is genuinely arm’s-length debt, and not, for example, capital injected by shareholders in the form of debt. 35 Definition of adjusted net profit Subsections FE 5(1BC) and FE 5(1BD) The adjusted net profit of a group is a proxy, albeit an imprecise one, for net cash flow from operations. It corresponds approximately to the “earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation” measure used in financial markets, usually referred to by its acronym EBITDA. The formula begins with net profit before tax for the relevant group (New Zealand or worldwide), determined using generally accepted accounting practice and consolidating companies for the purposes of eliminating intra-group transactions (see commentary on section FE 12B). A net loss is treated as a negative net profit. A pre-tax measure is used partly because the measure of tax expense used for GAAP purposes is unlikely to be a meaningful indication of current tax liabilities (or associated cashflows). For the New Zealand group, certain income arising from an interest in a foreign company is then removed, again using generally accepted accounting practice to measure this income. The income is removed if the interest is an income interest in a controlled foreign company, or an interest in a foreign investment fund that qualifies for the Australian exemption in subsection EX 35(1), or an interest in a foreign investment fund for which the attributable FIF income method is used. This income is removed because it is not subject to tax in New Zealand. An important part of what the thin capitalisation rules are trying to do is to ensure excessive deductions are not allocated to income that is not taxable in New Zealand. Net interest deductions (deductions less income), as determined under the Income Tax Act but again on a consolidated basis, are then added to the remaining net profit. This gives an estimate of cash flows before interest expense. In the case of the worldwide group, relevant members are treated as if they were resident for this purpose. Depreciation and amortisation, measured under GAAP, and again on a consolidated basis are then added back. These are non-cash expenses. When there is no interest apportionment (i.e. no denial of deductions) Subsections FE 5(1D) and (1E) An excess debt outbound entity is not denied any interest under the apportionment rule in section FE 6B, if its New Zealand group’s ratio of net interest to adjusted net profit is less than the minimum of: • 50% • 110% of the worldwide group’s net interest to adjusted net profit ratio. In other words, as long as the ratio is below a maximum ratio of 50% and net interest deductions correspond similarly to net profit in each of the New Zealand and worldwide groups, no interest deductions will be disallowed. 36 Net interest is defined in the same way as in subsections FE 5(1BB) and (1BD). The use of a net interest figure allows entities to reduce their apparent interest deductions for the purposes of thin capitalisation by on-lending their borrowings to foreign companies (pushing some debt offshore) and receiving corresponding interest income. Adjusted net profit is defined in subsections FE 5(1BC) and (1BD). The apportionment calculation Section FE 6B If a person is able to apply the alternative apportionment calculation, chooses to do so, and is not excepted by subsections FE 5(1D) and (1E), section FE 6B is the section used to perform the actual apportionment. The amount of interest deduction denied is given by the formula in subsection (1). In practice, deductions are denied by adding back income rather than reducing deductions. The terms in that formula are based on the interest-to-income ratio given by section FE 5(1E) and the thresholds seen in section FE 5(1D). “Net interest” is the actual amount of net interest deduction for the taxpayer (not the group) in the absence of the thin capitalisation rules. Parallels with the existing interest allocation calculation in section FE 6 are evident. Example: interest deductions denied X Co, a resident company with a single resident shareholder, owns 100% of Y Co, a foreign company. X Co would have net interest deductions of $1 million in the absence of the thin capitalisation rules, and the worldwide group would have net interest deductions of $3 million. X Co’s adjusted net profit is $3 million and the worldwide group’s adjusted net profit is $12 million. Assume X Co is able to use the alternative apportionment calculation. Then: net interest is $1 million; NZ group ratio is .333... ($1 million ÷ $3 million); threshold ratio is .275 (1.1 × $3 million ÷ $12 million); and the formula gives a result of $175,000 ($1 million × \[.333... – .275\] ÷ .333...). Therefore only $825,000 of interest deductions is effectively permitted. Note that if X Co instead had $825,000 of interest deductions in the first place, and the worldwide group’s deductions were unchanged, the NZ group ratio would be exactly equal to 110% of the ratio for the worldwide group, and deductions would not be denied. 37 Machinery provision Section FE 12B Section FE 12B specifies that certain amounts used in the thin capitalisation test are to be calculated using generally accepted accounting practice and on a consolidated basis. In the case of interest deductions and interest income, there are specific instructions to use tax concepts rather than accounting concepts to calculate the base amounts, but consolidation of these amounts is still undertaken using accounting principles. This is similar to the treatment of debt under the existing thin capitalisation test, in which the relevant debts are determined by the tax rules but consolidation occurs using accounting principles. Section FE 12B also limits the consolidation of amounts of any non-resident group members to the amount that is attributable to New Zealand-sourced income. Administrative requirements Section 65B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Taxpayers who use the proposed new rule must meet the following administrative requirements: • Firstly, the taxpayer must advise the Commissioner, in any manner the Commissioner may specify that the rule has been applied. • Secondly, the taxpayer must provide reconciliations of adjusted net profit to GAAP net profit, and of goodwill to items presented in the GAAP balance sheet, in any manner the Commissioner may specify. The advice and reconciliations must be furnished to the Commissioner by the due date for the taxpayer’s tax return for the relevant tax year under section 37 of the TAA. These requirements will enable Inland Revenue to monitor the extent of use of the alternative thin capitalisation rule and the appropriateness of the measures used in it. 38 STATE-OWNED BANKING GROUPS (Clauses 45(3), 57, 58 and 126(29)) Summary of proposed amendment The thin capitalisation rules are proposed to be altered to permit the Kiwibank group of companies to be treated separately from the rest of the New Zealand Post group. This is to reduce compliance costs and to ensure that the appropriate thin capitalisation test is used for the non-banking part of the New Zealand Post group. Application date For income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. This measure would apply retrospectively. Key features The thin capitalisation rules are proposed to be altered so that: • a state-owned banking group (the Kiwibank group of companies) is not subject to the thin capitalisation rules by reason of New Zealand Post’s non-banking activities; and • the New Zealand Post group may exclude the Kiwibank group of companies from its New Zealand group, so that it will apply the ordinary thin capitalisation rules rather than the thin capitalisation rules for banks. These alterations apply only so long as the Kiwibank group of companies is not subject, in its own right, to the thin capitalisation rules (for example, by directly acquiring a controlled foreign company). Detailed analysis All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless stated. Background The thin capitalisation rules, which limit excessive interest deductions against the New Zealand taxable income of multinationals, were extended in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009. Prior to the extension, they applied only to non-residents and residents controlled by non-residents. After the extension, they also applied to other taxpayers with controlling interests in foreign companies. 39 The New Zealand Post group has such controlling interests, so is newly subject to thin capitalisation. Because of the way the existing rules work, every New Zealand member of the group is subject to the rules, including Kiwibank. And because Kiwibank is a registered bank, the entire group must apply the special subset of thin capitalisation rules that apply to banks. This requires undertaking costly calculations for the non-bank members of the group (for bank members the calculations are based on information that is already produced) and allows debt to be, roughly, 96% of assets. 96% was determined to be an appropriate ratio for a bank when the thin capitalisation rules for banks were introduced, but is unusually high for the significant non-banking operations of the group (75% is the standard ratio for groups without a registered bank). Changes to rules The Bill changes the rules so that a New Zealand state-owned banking group can be treated separately from non-banking activities in the same group. Subsection FE 2(5) New subsection FE 2(5) removes the requirement for a member of a state-owned banking group, to which section FE 36B applies, to take into account CFC or FIF interests held by associates outside the group (such as under sections FE 38, FE 41 or EX 15). In effect, this removes Kiwibank from the scope of the interest apportionment rule in section FE 7; interests held by non-banking members of the New Zealand Post group no longer need to be counted. However, it only removes Kiwibank from this scope because no member of the banking group currently has its own interest in a non- portfolio FIF or CFC. If a member were to acquire such an interest, all members of the group would be within the scope of section FE 7 again. Section FE 36 and 36B The definition of a New Zealand banking group is proposed to be altered so that, in the exclusive case of a registered bank that is 100%-owned by the New Zealand government the group consists of: • the registered bank; • a company with a direct 100% voting interest in the registered bank; and • those entities that are part of the financial reporting group for which the registered bank is the reporting entity, or would be part of it but for relevant materiality thresholds. The terms “financial reporting group” and “reporting entity” are defined by the Financial Reporting Act 1993. This isolates the Kiwibank group from the rest of the New Zealand Post group. Without the alteration, the entire New Zealand Post group including Kiwibank would be treated as a New Zealand banking group. 40 The isolation relies on the definition of a New Zealand group for a company that is not part of the Kiwibank group. Paragraph FE 28(1)(c) excludes members of a New Zealand banking group from that New Zealand group (a New Zealand banking group exists despite the non-application of section FE 7 to that group). In other words, that company’s New Zealand group will be all the New Zealand-based entities in the New Zealand Post group except those in the Kiwibank group. That company will therefore use the standard apportionment rule in section FE 6 and not the banking rule in section FE 7. The new rule in section FE 36B may not apply in certain situations. Specifically, a member of the New Zealand banking group (determined as if section FE 36B applied) may have interests in an offshore company that would bring it within the scope of section FE 2, even ignoring interests of associated persons outside the group under sections EX 15, FE 38 and FE 41. If that is the case, the existing rules in section FE 36 are invoked. (To prevent circularity, subsection FE 2(5) is ignored when deciding whether or not section FE 2 would apply). That is, if a member of the Kiwibank group had an interest in a controlled foreign company or certain interests in foreign investment funds, the entire New Zealand Post group would again be a New Zealand banking group. A decision has been taken at this stage not to develop more complex rules which might apply if both the banking and non-banking operations of New Zealand Post had offshore operations (currently only the non-banking operations do). In that case, there is a fall- back to the rules existing before the Bill. A more comprehensive solution may be considered at a later date, perhaps in conjunction with other work on thin capitalisation. 41 APPLICATION TO NON-RESIDENTS WITH NO FIXED ESTABLISHMENT (Clauses 46(1), 46(2), 50, 51 and 53 to 55) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes changes to the thin capitalisation rules to limit their application in the case of non-resident companies that do not carry on business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. Such companies will no longer be subject to the rules if all their New Zealand-sourced income that is not relieved under a double tax agreement is non-resident passive income. Application date Income years beginning on or after I July 2011. Detailed analysis The thin capitalisation rules currently apply to non-resident companies that have New Zealand-sourced income that is not relieved under a double tax agreement, even if the company has an insignificant physical presence in New Zealand. This is to ensure that such non-residents are not artificially lowering their taxable income by debt-funding their New Zealand activities or investments. However, the inclusion of such companies causes difficulties with the definition of the “New Zealand group” under the rules, and may bring in non-resident entities that should not logically be included. When the New Zealand-sourced income is “non-resident passive income”, it is subject to a withholding tax in New Zealand which is typically a final tax. That is, no interest deductions may be taken against the income. In such a case, it is not necessary to apply the thin capitalisation rules. The Bill makes changes to stop the thin capitalisation rules applying to non-resident companies that are currently caught by the rules only because they have New Zealand- sourced income, but have purely non-resident passive income. 42 EXEMPTION FROM THE OUTBOUND RULES (Clause 47(2)) Summary of proposed amendment Section FE 5(1B)(b) provides an exemption from the thin capitalisation rules for excess debt outbound companies if total interest deductions for the New Zealand group do not exceed $250,000. This exemption is rendered effectively redundant by section FE 6(3)(ac)(ii) which reduces to zero the deductions subject to apportionment under the rules where the finance costs of an outbound entity do not exceed $1 million. Accordingly, it is proposed that section FE 5(1B)(b) is repealed. Application date Income years beginning on or after 1 July 2011. Detailed analysis Section FE 51B(b) and section FE 6(3)(ac)(ii) provide overlapping exemptions from the thin capitalisation rules for excess debt outbound companies. Because the threshold for the latter exemption is more generous, section FE 51B(b) is now largely redundant and ought to be repealed. There are some minor differences in scope between section FE 5(1B)(b) and section FE 6(3)(ac)(ii), as noted below. It is not considered that these differences affect the case for a simple repeal of section FE 5(1B)(b). Section FE 5(1B)(b) sets the $250,000 exemption threshold based on interest deductions under sections DB 6 to DB 8, whereas the $1 million threshold in section FE 6(3)(ac)(ii) also takes account of “FRD” (basically, fixed-rate dividends: see section FE 6(3)(ab)). In this regard, section FE 6(3)(ac)(ii) is less generous than section FE 5(1B)(b) and it is possible that, where fixed-rate equity is used in place of ordinary debt, the latter may provide an exemption where the former does not. However, since the thin capitalisation rules now extend to cover FRD, the approach taken in section FE 6(3)(ac)(ii) is appropriate. Again, this supports the conclusion that section FE 5(1B)(b) can be repealed. The $250,000 exemption under section FE 5(1B)(b) is not available when the New Zealand group includes an entity with an income interest in a CFC that is deriving rent from land in the CFC’s local jurisdiction. There is no equivalent exclusion from the $1 million exemption under section FE 6(3)(ab), which means that this rule will seldom bite in practice. 43 Zero rate of AIL on bonds 45 ZERO RATE OF AIL ON QUALIFYING BONDS (Clause 142) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill seeks to remove a potential tax barrier to non-resident investment in New Zealand corporate bonds. More specifically, the approved issuer levy would apply at a zero percent rate (as opposed to the usual 2 percent rate) on interest that is paid in respect of debt securities that satisfy a set of strict requirements designed to limit the zero rate to bonds that are widely held and issued in New Zealand and to guard against the fiscal risk of closely-held debt being packaged or reclassified so as to qualify for the zero rate. The 2% rate of AIL will be retained and AIL will be considered to be paid when either the 2% rate, or the new nil rate applies. This ensures that a nil rate of non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) can still apply when the borrower and the lender are not associated. Application date The proposed changes would apply to interest payments made on or after the date the Bill is enacted. This means that the zero rate will be able to be used in respect of future interest payments on bonds which have been issued prior to the Bill being enacted. Key features The debt security must first comply with the existing AIL registration requirements in section 32M of the Tax Administration Act 1991 and section 86H of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 to get the 2% rate of AIL. The Bill proposes inserting a new section 86IB into of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 which would set out the requirements that a registered security must meet to qualify for the zero rate of AIL. These are: • that the security is denominated in New Zealand dollars; and • that the security was offered to the public for the purposes of the securities Act 1978; and • that the security was not issued as a private placement; and • that the security is not an asset-backed security; and • that the registry and paying agent activities for the security are conducted through one or more fixed establishments in New Zealand; and • that the security is listed on an Exchange registered under the Securities market Act 1988 (i.e. the NZDX) or satisfies a widely-held test. 46 The widely-held test is outlined in new section 86IB(2). A bond needs to satisfy the widely-held test at, or before the time of the interest payment. This means that if the test has been satisfied on one previous occasion it is not necessary to re-apply the test a second time. There are two parts to the widely-held test. Firstly, the securities must be held by at least 100 separate persons whom the issuer could not reasonably expect to be associated with the issuer or with one of the other 99 persons holding the bonds. The second part of the widely-held test is that no person or group of associated persons holds more than 10% of the value of the securities at the time the test is applied. Regardless of whether they pay AIL at 2% or 0%, the approved issuer will generally need to continue to file an AIL return/payment slip by the 20 th day of the month following the month in which an interest payment was made. This slip will now require the approved issuer to record the total amount of interest payments which have been zero-rated. Background New Zealand’s non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) and approved issuer levy (AIL) rules have been identified as a potential tax barrier to non-resident investment in New Zealand corporate bonds. NRWT generally applies at a rate of 10% on interest payments made by a New Zealand borrower to a non-resident lender. However, in cases where the New Zealand borrower and the lender are unrelated, an approved issuer levy (AIL) of 2 percent can be paid as an alternative to paying NRWT. The AIL and NRWT rules can increase the effective interest rate of bonds issued to non-residents. For example, a non-resident investor who requires a 10 percent return to buy bonds from a New Zealand company would require the company to pay an interest rate of 10% to the investor and a further 0.2% to Inland Revenue, increasing the company’s cost of funds. One way to remove the tax barrier to non-resident investment in bonds would be to have a zero rate of AIL apply on all debt instruments between unrelated persons. However, this would have very high fiscal cost. In addition to the foregone AIL revenues (about $62m a year), an unrestricted exemption could encourage some domestic lending activity to shift offshore. In such cases, the margin earned on the loan would no longer be subject to New Zealand tax. This could pose a significant fiscal risk because of the importance of the banking sector to New Zealand’s corporate tax base. This makes it critical to ensure that interest paid on closely-held debt (such as loans, syndicated loans and private placements) is excluded from any exemption. Accordingly, the Bill limits the zero rate of AIL to bonds that meet a set of strict requirements designed to limit the zero rate to bonds that have been widely-held and issued in New Zealand and to guard against the risk of closely-held debt being packaged or reclassified so as to qualify for the zero rate. 47 Detailed analysis In order to access the zero rate of AIL, the issuer of the security must register to pay AIL in the first place. The issuer of the security must be an approved issuer under section 32M of the Tax Administration Act 1991 and must have registered the security under section 86H of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. This allows them to pay AIL at a rate of 2%. The Bill amends section 86I of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act so that AIL is considered to be paid when either the existing 2% rate is paid, or the new nil rate applies. When AIL is considered to be paid, a nil rate of non-resident withholding tax will apply under section RF 12 of the Income Tax Act so long as the borrower and lender are not associated and so long as the interest is not jointly derived with a New Zealand resident. Regardless of whether they pay AIL at 2% or 0%, approved issuers will need to continue to file an AIL return/payment slip by the 20 th day of the month following the month in which the interest payment was made. This slip will now require the approved issuer to record the total amount of interest payments which have been zero-rated. A person will not generally be able to get the zero rate of AIL in respect of any interest payments in which they fail to provide this information by the 20 th day of the following month. However, there is scope for the Commissioner to provide a later deadline in a notice given to the approved issuer. Alternatively an approved issuer that is late at supplying this information would still be able to get a 2 percent rate of AIL (i.e. under section 86I(a)) if they pay AIL at a later date along with any interest and penalties. The Bill proposes inserting a new section 86IB into the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 which would set out the requirements that a registered security must meet to qualify for the zero rate of AIL. Issued in New Zealand To qualify for the zero rate of AIL the bonds must be issued in New Zealand. Bonds issued offshore do not contribute to the development of capital markets within New Zealand. The objective of the zero rate of AIL is to remove a potential obstacle to the further development of the New Zealand bond market (bonds issued in New Zealand and denominated in New Zealand dollars) as opposed to reducing taxes on foreign debt funding more generally. The first requirement is that the securities are denominated in New Zealand dollars. A supporting requirement is that the activities of the registrar and paying agent for the security are conducted through one or more fixed establishments in New Zealand (i.e. these activities are carried out in New Zealand). Bonds will be registered with a registrar whose role is to check that the bonds comply with relevant legal obligations and that the amount of bonds on issue matches the amount of bonds authorised by the company. A paying agent is an agent who accepts payments from the issuer of a security and then distributes the payments to the holders of the security. 48 Issued publicly Two requirements are used to limit the zero rate to bonds that are issued publicly. Firstly the securities must be an offer of securities to the public under the Securities Act 1978. The Securities Act does not expressly define an offer of securities to the public, but section 3 of the Act provides guidance as to how the phrase should be interpreted. Section 3 of the Act lists people who are not considered to be members of the public. These include associates, institutional investors, underwriters and investors who pay a minimum subscription price of at least $500,000 before allotment of the securities. The Securities Act requires the preparation of an investment statement, a registered trust deed and (generally) a registered prospectus before a debt security can be issued to the public. Secondly the securities were not issued as a private placement. A “private placement” is not a formally defined term in the Income Tax Act so this exclusion relies on the ordinary commercial meaning of a private placement. For example, securities that were exclusively issued to a group that were pre-selected by the issuer would probably be considered to be a private placement. Not an asset-backed security The securities cannot be asset-backed securities. Again, an “asset-backed security” is not formally defined so would be interpreted using the ordinary commercial meaning of this term. For example, securities whose interest payments were directly financed out of cash-flows from a pool of financial assets such as mortgages or other loans could be considered to be asset-backed securities. The purpose of this requirement is to deny the nil rate of AIL in cases where a group of loans have been bundled together and securitised into a bond. The concern is that such securities could be used to effectively shift the margin earned on closely-held loans (such as mortgages) outside the New Zealand tax base. Note that this measure is not intended to exclude bonds that are simply secured against a collateral asset which the bond holder can claim in the case of default. Listed on the NZDX or widely-held Finally the securities must either be listed on an exchange registered under the Securities Market Act 1988, or alternatively pass a widely-held test. Currently, the NZDX is the only debt exchange that is registered under the Securities Market Act. Securities listed on the NZDX will not need to apply the widely-held test and are expected to generally satisfy the other requirements listed above. The widely-held test is outlined in new section 86IB(2). A bond needs to satisfy the widely-held test at, or before the time of the interest payment. This means that if the test has been satisfied on one previous occasion it is not necessary to re-apply the test a second time. There are two parts to the widely-held test. Firstly, the securities must be held by at least 100 separate persons whom the issuer could not reasonably expect to be associated to the issuer or with one of the other 99 persons holding the bonds. For example, if there are two associated persons who each hold a bond, these persons should only be counted as one person for the purposes of this test. 49 Note that the securities need not all be issued on the same date so long as the debt securities are identical (i.e. they are fungible). For example if half the bonds were issued in January and half in August and by the 14 th of September the total number of bondholders has reached 100 persons, then the test could be satisfied in respect of interest payments made on or after the 14 th of September. This means that issuers can build up to 100 investors over time, although they will only get the nil rate of AIL in respect of interest payments made on or after the first day that the securities satisfy the test. If the number of persons who holds the bonds subsequently drops below 100, the test will still be satisfied so long as this threshold was not met simply because of an arrangement (that the issuer could reasonably be expected to be aware of) that was intended to temporarily increase the number of persons holding the bonds. The second part of the widely-held test is that no person or group of associated persons holds more than 10% of the value of the securities at the time the test is applied. If a person subsequently comes to hold more than 10% of the bonds, the test will continue to be satisfied. 51 Miscellaneous remedial changes 53 REVALUING INHERITED FORMER GREY-LIST SHARES (Clause 41) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes re-valuing some foreign shares which were inherited prior to the introduction of inheritance rules in October 2005. Some investors claim that these shares have a nil or low cost. This means they qualify for the $50,000 “de minimis” exemption from the FIF rules, even though the market value of the shares at the time of the bequest may have been considerably higher than $50,000. It is not appropriate that these shares continue to be exempt from tax. Application date The revaluation of these shares will occur on the date the Bill is enacted. Key features It is proposed that a new section EX 67B will apply to shares in FIFs that were inherited at zero cost or at the cost of the person that made the bequest. It will only apply if the FIF was a grey list company at the time the shares were inherited and if the shares were inherited prior to 1 April 2007 (when the grey list exemption was abolished for portfolio shares). These shares will be subject to a deemed sale and reacquisition at market value on the date that the Bill is enacted. The consequences of this deemed sale and reacquisition would be: • a taxable capital gain if the interest is held on revenue account; and • entry into the normal FIF attribution rules unless the total cost of FIF interests (including the newly determined market value of the re-valued interests) is less than $50,000, or some other exemption (e.g. sections EX 31-39) applies. Any resulting tax liabilities will be able to be spread over 3 years, with at least one third paid in the first year, one half of the remaining tax paid in the second year, and the rest in the third year after the year the disposal takes effect. Background Under the FIF rules, if a person has attributing FIF interests that cost less than $50,000, that person has no attributed FIF income (paragraphs CQ 5(1)(d) and (e)). If a person inherits shares, then the cost base of those shares is their market value at the time of transfer or, if certain other conditions are met, their original cost to the transferer (see subpart FC which primarily relates to transfers to close relatives). 54 However, the inheritance rules in subpart FC are a relatively recent development, applying from 1 October 2005. Prior to the existence of these rules, it was often argued that inherited assets had a cost base of nil. A cost base of nil could have persisted until there was another transfer of the shares. The problem relates mainly to inherited interests in FIFs from former “grey list” countries; most other FIF interests would have a market-value cost base following inheritance. There are some existing provisions to force a cost based on market value for attributing interests in a FIF, if those interests were not acquired for market value see (sections EX 67 and GC 4). However these provisions did not apply to interests that were grey list FIF interests at the time of transfer, because such interests were not attributing interests in a FIF. It is not an appropriate outcome that people who inherited shares prior to the abolition of the grey list should continue to be carved out of the FIF rules indefinitely. The grey list is supposed to have been repealed for portfolio FIF interests. 55 QUALIFYING COMPANIES AMENDMENT (Clause 66) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that qualifying companies will be excluded from having any income interests in a CFC or interests of 10% or more in a FIF. Application date The change would apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. Key features It is proposed that section HA8B(b) be amended to replace “attributing interests” with “interests”. Background As part of the Taxation (International Tax, Life Insurance and Remedial Matters) Act 2009, an exemption was introduced for foreign dividends derived by companies. This means that the exemption applies to qualifying companies even though these companies are able to pass exempt income out to their shareholders with no further tax. This is inconsistent with the fact that exempt foreign income would usually be taxed if received directly by an individual taxpayer or when un-imputed dividends were paid by a company to individual shareholders. An amendment was made in the Taxation (International Tax, Life Insurance and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 to address this issue. However, the amendment refers to “attributing interests” in a FIF. This means that non-attributing active FIFs and FIFs that qualify for the grey list exemption could be under-taxed as these are not attributing interests. 56 AMENDMENT TO NON-RESIDENT EXCLUSION FROM CONDUIT ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULE (Clauses 64 and 129) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that the conduit anti-avoidance rule in section GZ 2 be amended to exclude conduit tax relief received by a CTR-group member to the extent that the CTR- group member is owned by non-residents. Application date The change would apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. Key features Under the conduit tax rules chains of New Zealand holding companies were defined as “CTR group members” and each CTR group member was treated as non-resident for the purposes of the conduit rules to the extent that it was owned by non-residents (see sections YD 9 to YD 11). The conduit anti-avoidance rule is intended to apply to tax relief arrangements that ultimately benefit a New Zealand resident investor. Amendments are made to the conduit anti-avoidance rule in section GZ 2 and the application of sections YD 9 to YD 11 to ensure that the definitions of resident and non-resident are consistent with those that previously applied under the recently repealed conduit tax relief rules. Background The conduit anti-avoidance rule is intended to claw back conduit tax relief from arrangements that were entered into in anticipation of the repeal of the conduit rules, and that had the effect of reducing the tax liabilities of New Zealand shareholders. This reflects the fact that conduit tax relief was designed to relieve tax on non-residents investing through New Zealand into CFCs. Conduit tax relief was not intended to apply to income that was ultimately owned by New Zealand residents. The conduit anti- avoidance rule applies to arrangements that generated conduit tax relief credits between 4 December 2007 (when an issues paper announcing this policy was released) and the date from which conduit tax relief was repealed. The anti-avoidance rule does not apply to conduit tax relief received by the conduit tax relief company itself, or by a CTR holding company for the CTR company. 57 These exclusions are intended to ensure that the anti-avoidance rule does not apply to residents that are holding companies for non-resident investors. However the exclusions fail to accommodate conduit tax relief companies that are held through a chain of more than two New Zealand companies that are ultimately owned by non- residents. Under the conduit tax rules such chains of companies were defined as “CTR group members” and each CTR group member was treated as non-resident for the purposes of the conduit rules to the extent that it was owned by non-residents (e.g. a CTR-group member that was 100% owned by non-residents would be 100% non- resident) (see sections YD 9 to YD 11). Consistent with this, the Bill amends the anti-avoidance rule in section GZ 2 so that this rule does not apply in respect of conduit tax relief received by a CTR-group member to the extent that the CTR-group member is owned by non-residents. 58 ATTRIBUTED FOREIGN INCOME – LIABILITY TO TAX (Clauses 19(3) to 19(5), 21, 22(1), 22(4) and 126(3)) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill expands the scope of income that can be excluded from attributed foreign income, by permitting some companies, which are not recognised for tax purposes in the country they operate in, to nevertheless be treated as resident in that country. The Bill also adds requirements to prevent abuse of the rules that allow some income to be ignored. Application date Income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. This amendment is retrospective so that affected taxpayers can benefit from the policy from the inception of the international tax rules, consistent with the original intent. Key features • Income a controlled foreign company receives from a non-attributing active CFC (an active business) resident in the same country may be ignored for tax purposes even if one or both CFCs are not liable to tax in that country. • Income a controlled foreign company receives from rental property in the same country may be ignored even if the CFC is not liable to tax in that country. • Income a controlled foreign company receives from telecommunications services between the country it is resident in and New Zealand may be ignored even if the CFC is not liable to tax in that country. • A CFC may be part of a test group in the country it is resident in, even if it is not liable to tax in that country. For these to apply the following requirements must be met: • the CFC is a resident of the country in question under section YD 3 (this does not require liability to tax); • the CFC is wholly-owned (directly or indirectly through a wholly-owned chain of companies) under the laws of both New Zealand and the foreign country, by another CFC that is resident in that country under section YD 3; • that other CFC is liable to tax in the jurisdiction on the income of the CFC by reason of its domicile, residence, place of incorporation or centre of management, in the same period as the CFC would be liable if it were an ordinary company liable to tax; 59 • neither the CFC nor the other CFC is treated as a dual-resident; and • neither the CFC nor the other CFC has a fixed establishment or a permanent establishment outside the country. The first, fourth and fifth requirements are extended to apply to all companies, not just those that are not liable to tax in a particular country. If these requirements are not met, it will not be possible to use the exemptions for payments from a non-attributing active CFC, rent from property in the same country or income from telecommunications services between the CFC’s country of residence and New Zealand, or to be in a test group, regardless of liability to tax. As well as applying to CFCs, the proposed changes will also apply in respect of FIFs that use the attributable FIF income method. Detailed analysis All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless stated. Background Same country exemptions Existing law provides that amounts that would be included in attributed foreign income, for taxpayers with interests in foreign companies, may be ignored in some cases where the income arises in the same country as the foreign company (see paragraphs EX 20B(5)(c), (7)(a), (7)(c), (11)(a), (12)(a), and paragraphs EX 21D(1)(a) and 21E(2)(a)). To take advantage of these “same country exemptions”, the foreign company must show it is resident in that country by reason of liability to tax. When same country exemptions do not apply (not liable to tax) Some entities that New Zealand considers to be foreign companies are not treated as taxable entities in the country where they are registered or organised. For example, a United States Limited Liability Company (LLC) such as a so-called “Delaware company” is often considered by the United States to be analogous to a partnership for tax purposes. In that case, it is not liable to tax in that country (though its shareholders may be) and the foreign company is not able to tax advantage of the same country exemptions. When the current position makes sense Excluding entities such as LLCs from the same country exemptions is often the correct result. For example, if an LLC owns an ordinary active company in the same country, and is able to extract the profit from that active company in the form of an interest payment, there may be very little foreign tax imposed on the income of the LLC, its shareholders, or the active company. In that case, New Zealand would not be happy to exempt the income from tax here. 60 When the exemptions should apply even though there is no liability to tax However, there are cases where excluding entities such as LLCs from the same country exemptions is unnecessary and even counterproductive. In particular, if the LLC is wholly-owned by another company in the same country, and that other company is liable for tax on the LLC’s income, the outcome should be similar to the case in which all the companies are liable to tax in that country. In those cases, normal tax is paid on the active income of the group in the foreign country and New Zealand should be prepared to exempt the income here. Remedial amendments when liability to tax is not an issue The widening of the same country exemptions to entities that are not liable to tax in the foreign country has highlighted a number of situations in which the existing exemption – for entities that are liable to tax in the foreign country – may be too wide. Companies may be resident by reason of liability to tax in more than one country. Or they may be resident in one country but conduct significant operations in another. In that case, it may not be appropriate to assume that the country in which income is being earned is ultimately taxing the income. Imposing additional conditions on the same country exemptions for all entities Paragraphs EX 20B(7)(a), EX 20B(11)(a), EX 21D(1)(a) and EX 21E(2)(b), subsections EX 20B(16), EX 21D(10), EX 21E(14), and definition of associated non-attributing active CFC in section YA 1 To limit the use of the same country exemptions to cases where it is more likely that active income is being taxed normally by the relevant foreign country, the Bill proposes three additional conditions for residence. These are: • firstly, that the CFC is a resident of the country in question under section YD 3; • secondly, that neither the CFC nor the other CFC (in cases where there is a transaction between CFCs) is treated as a dual-resident; and • thirdly, that neither the CFC nor the other CFC has a fixed establishment or a permanent establishment outside the country. The existing section YD 3 determines a single country of residence of a CFC (it does not require liability to tax). A CFC is regarded as a dual-resident if one or more of three conditions is met: • the CFC is treated as a resident of a country other than the country in section YD 3 under the tax law of the relevant jurisdiction; • the company is liable to income tax by reason of its domicile, residence, place of incorporation, or centre of management in a country other than the country in section YD 3; 61 • the company is treated as a resident of a country other than the country in section YD 3, under an agreement that would be a double tax agreement if New Zealand was a party to it. “Fixed establishment” is a defined term in the Income Tax Act. “Permanent establishment” is an analogous term used in double tax agreements and extensively discussed in the OECD’s commentary to the Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital. Widening the same country exemptions for entities with no liability to tax Paragraphs EX 20B(7)(a), EX 20B(11)(a), EX 21D(1)(a) and EX 21E(2)(b), subsections EX 20B(16), EX 21D(10), EX 21E(14), and definition of associated non-attributing active CFC in section YA 1 At the same time as clarifying the requirements for all companies that use the same country exemptions, the Bill widens the scope of the exemptions to include entities that are not liable to income tax because they are not considered to be taxable entities in the country where they are resident. A CFC that is not liable to tax in the relevant country may still make use of the exemption if it meets the other conditions (above) and two further conditions are met: • The CFC is wholly-owned, under the laws of New Zealand and the foreign country, either directly or through a chain of wholly-owned companies, by another CFC that is resident in the same country under section YD 3; and • The other CFC is liable to tax on the income of the CFC in the relevant country by reason of its domicile, residence, place of incorporation or centre of management, in the same period as the CFC would be liable if it was an ordinary company liable to tax there. Example: using same country exemptions when not liable to tax Hold Co owns 100% of LLC Co, which in turn owns 100% of Op Co. All three companies are CFCs incorporated in and managed from the United States, and are treated as residents of the United States under section YD 3. None of the companies have operations outside the United States. Op Co and Hold Co are liable to tax by reason of residence in the United States, but LLC Co is treated as a partnership for tax purposes and so is not liable to tax. Op Co is a non-attributing active CFC. Op Co pays interest to LLC Co. The interest is not subject to tax in the United States in the hands of LLC Co, but is subject to tax in the hands of Hold Co. LLC Co can ignore the payment of interest from Op Co, even though it is not liable to income tax in the United States. LLC Co is wholly owned by owned by Hold Co, and Hold Co is liable to tax in the United States on LLC Co’s income (including interest income). 62 ACTIVE BUSINESS TEST – CLARIFICATIONS AND REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS (Clauses 20, 22(2) and 22(3)) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes changes to the definitions of passive and total income used in the active business test for controlled foreign companies. These will make it easier to pass the active business test that is based on accounting data. The Bill also clarifies that when the active business test is applied to a group of CFCs, a CFC may not be included in more than one group. Application date Income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. This amendment is retrospective so that affected taxpayers can benefit from the policy from the inception of the international tax rules, consistent with the original intent. Key features The Bill proposes changes to ensure that: • Rental income may be included in the measure of reported income in section EX 21E (which contains the active business test using accounting data). • Income from financial arrangements that is received from a non-attributing active CFC may be excluded from the measure of passive income in section EX 21E. • Income from some financial assets that are in the nature of accounts receivable may be excluded from the measure of passive income in section EX 21E. • A CFC that is part of a “test group” for the purposes of the active business test under sections EX 21D or EX 21E cannot be part of another test group and cannot apply the test as an individual CFC. The first three proposed changes fix unintended omissions. The final change is for clarification only, and does not – in our view – result in the effect of the law changing. Detailed analysis All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless stated. 63 Background The active business test is used when a New Zealand resident has an income interest in a foreign company. If the foreign company passes the active business test, the New Zealander may ignore the current income of the foreign company for tax purposes. There are two forms of the test, one using accounting data and one using the usual provisions of the Income Tax Act for calculating income. In concept, both are similar – they measure the amount of passive income of the foreign company as a proportion of total (gross) income, and deem the company to be an active business if the proportion is less than 5%. Passive income is exhaustively defined. For example, it explicitly includes rental income and interest income. However, there are numerous exceptions which allow a person to remove items if they wish. Total income is also defined. It is possible for companies in the same country (in the case of some interests in foreign investment funds, companies in any country) to undertake the test as a group, using consolidated accounts. This may reduce compliance costs and also simplifies the treatment of holding companies or other companies with non-operational functions within the group. Remedial changes Paragraph EX 21E(10)(ab) Reported revenue in section EX 21E(10) is the measure of total income for the purposes of the active business test using accounting concepts. Reported revenue includes “revenue” if IFRS is used, a term which is defined by International Accounting Standard 18. Lease income is generally excluded from the definition of “revenue” under that standard. Lease income is brought in under another item that is part of reported revenue, but only if it is income other than rent from finance or operating leases. This means that rental income may not be able to be included in the measure of total income. This is not intended, and this Bill proposes an amendment to the definition of reported revenue so that rent may be included. Paragraph EX 21E(9)(cb) Reported passive in section EX 21E(7) is the measure of passive income that is used in the active business test using accounting concepts. One component of reported passive is income or loss from a financial asset, other than a derivative or a share on capital account. Accounts receivable can be financial assets. This means that gains or losses on accounts receivable – for example, due to exchange rate fluctuations – may be included in the measure of passive income. However, active businesses will have accounts receivable, so including them is not necessarily appropriate. Reported passive also includes interest received from associated non-attributing CFCs. Such interest may not be ignored even though other forms of passive income from such CFCs can be (see paragraphs EX 21E(9)(a) to (c)). 64 The Bill makes a change to the measure of passive income to address these problems. The change allows gains or losses on financial assets (including interest income) to be excluded from the measure of passive income if: • they are included in the measure to begin with (see the existing provision at the beginning of subsection EX 21E(9)); and • they could be excluded under the active business test that uses tax rules (see subsection EX 20B(12), but subject to the modification described below). This allows the exclusion of amounts that are, broadly speaking, payments from related active entities and gains or losses relating to accounts receivable. The exclusions in subsection EX 20B(12) are exclusions from financial arrangement income. The subsection does not apply to financial arrangement expenditure. However, in the context of section EX 21E, it would be inappropriate not to exclude expenditure if income was being excluded; section EX 21E refers to gains or losses from financial assets. Therefore, paragraph EX 21E(9)(cb) refers to any gain or loss on a financial asset that is a financial arrangement or agreement that subsection EX 20B(12) refers to (whether or not the arrangement or agreement actually generates income under that subsection). That is, a person may exclude gains under the exclusion, but only if they also exclude similar losses. Clarification – test groups Subsection EX 21B(4) Subsections EX 21D(1) and EX 21E(2) each define a “test group” for the purposes of the active business test. The Bill proposes a clarification to make it clear that a CFC may not be part of more than one test group, and may not apply the test on an individual basis if it is part of a test group. 65 ABILITY FOR COMMISSIONER TO IMPOSE CONDITIONS ON AN INSURANCE CFC DETERMINATION (Clause 140) Summary of proposed amendment The Commissioner is currently able to issue a determination that an insurer is a non- attributing active CFC. The bill proposes that the authorising provision be amended to expressly give the Commissioner an ability to impose conditions for the application of the determination. Application date Income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. Key features Proposed new section 91AAQ(5B) would allow the Commissioner to stipulate conditions that must be satisfied in addition to the existing requirements for a CFC or CFC group member to qualify as a non-attributing active CFC. Background As part of the Taxation (International Tax, Life Insurance and Remedial Matters) Act 2009, an exemption was introduced for insurance CFCs as a transitional measure until further work was done to develop special rules for financial CFCs more generally. To qualify for this exemption the insurance CFC must first have applied for and obtained a determination from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and this determination must not have expired or been revoked. Section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 regulates this process. The bill amends section 91AAQ to enable the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to be able to impose conditions on an insurance CFC determination. For example, a determination could be made conditional on the insurer informing the Commissioner of any significant changes to its organisational structure, funding or major business activities. Note that the Commissioner already has the ability to revoke a previously issued determination. 66 FOREIGN DIVIDEND EXEMPTION – DEDUCTIBLE DIVIDENDS (Clause 126(16)) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes a remedial amendment to the exemption for dividends received by companies. The amendment widens the definition of deductible foreign equity distribution to include dividends that are deductible to a person other than a company. Application date Date of introduction of the Bill, to prevent people taking advantage of the identified deficiency before it is remedied. Key features The proposed definition of deductible foreign equity distribution is widened to include payments received by a company that give rise to a deduction for foreign tax of any person, whether a company or not. Previously, the definition was limited to amounts that were deductible to the company making the distribution, and to companies in the same group of companies as the distributing company. Detailed analysis All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless stated. Background Most foreign dividends received by companies are exempt income (section CW 9). However, deductible foreign equity distributions are not exempt income. This limitation is intended to prevent double non-taxation of income (deductible in the foreign country, not taxable in New Zealand). A deductible foreign equity distribution is defined to be, in the simplest case, a distribution that is deductible to the company making the distribution, or to another company in the same group of companies. There is also a further provision to deal with amounts sourced indirectly from amounts that may have been doubly non-taxed at an earlier stage. We are aware of structures that have been contemplated by taxpayers and that can achieve effective double non-taxation of income without triggering the definition of deductible foreign equity distribution. 67 In particular, there are cases where New Zealand does not consider an entity to be a company, but the foreign country does and allows it a deduction that is attributable, directly or indirectly, to a dividend received by a New Zealand company. Remedial change Definition of deductible foreign equity distribution in section YA 1 The Bill proposes widening the definition of deductible foreign equity distribution to include payments that generate a deduction, for foreign tax purposes, for any person. This applies regardless of whether the person is an incorporated body or not (the Interpretation Act 1999 explicitly includes “an unincorporated body” in the definition of a person). 68 LOSSES OF CONTROLLED FOREIGN COMPANIES – TRANSITION (Subclauses 70(1) and 70(2)) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes rewording transitional provisions dealing with losses arising under the old international tax rules, and being carried forward under the new international tax rules, to ensure the policy intent of these provisions is realised. Application date Income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. Detailed analysis All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless stated. Subsections IQ 2B(1) and IQ 2B(2) These provisions are intended to reduce carried-forward losses of controlled foreign companies (CFCs). This is because the losses arose at a time when all income was expected to be taxed, whereas only passive income will be taxed under the new international tax rules. CFC losses are “ring-fenced” by country, so that they may be used only to offset CFC income from the same country. References to “a CFC or FIF that is resident in a country” were intended to refer to this ring-fencing, but may have created doubt that the transitional provisions apply to carried-forward losses of CFCs that have been liquidated or migrated. The Bill rewords the provision to make clear that the transitional rule applies to all ring- fenced losses, as intended. 69 FOREIGN TAX CREDITS OF CONTROLLED FOREIGN COMPANIES – TRANSITION (Clause 74) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill rewords transitional provisions dealing with foreign tax credits arising under the old international tax rules, and being carried forward under the new international tax rules, to ensure the policy intent of these provisions is realised. Application date Income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. Detailed analysis All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless stated. Subsections LK 5B(1) and LK 5B(2) These provisions are intended to reduce carried-forward foreign tax credits of controlled foreign companies (CFCs). The Bill rewords the provision to make clear that the transitional rule applies to all carried-forward credits, as intended The changes proposed are analogous to those for carried-forward losses (see commentary on carried-forward losses above). 70 OTHER REMEDIAL CHANGES (Clauses 17, 70(5), 71, 126(19) and 141) All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless stated. Paragraph (a) of the definition of fixed-rate share in section YA 1 is proposed to be amended with retrospective effect to make it clear that it applies to section FE 6 in the thin capitalisation rules. This corrects an oversight. Section DX 3 is proposed to be repealed with effect from the 2013–14 income year. This repeal was missed when other provisions relating to supplementary dividend holding companies were repealed in an earlier amending act. A proposed new subsection IQ 2B(11) provides an explicit currency conversion rule for determining carried-forward losses during a transitional period from the old to the new international tax rules. An explicit rule was not provided at the time the transitional rule was first enacted. The rule follows, broadly speaking, the existing treatment of foreign currency amounts in subpart YF. The amendment has retrospective effect. The Bill corrects a drafting error in paragraphs IQ 3(1)(a) and (b), with retrospective effect (back to the application date of the Income Tax Act 2007). The paragraphs deal with carried-forward losses of foreign investment funds (FIFs) but erroneously referred to losses of controlled foreign companies (CFCs). Clause 141 would re-enact a provision whose effective date had been unintentionally over-ridden because of an early application date in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans- Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010.
Taxation (Income-sharing Tax Credit) Bill Commentary on the Bill Hon Peter Dunne Minister of Revenue First published in August 2010 by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington 6140. Taxation (Income-sharing Tax Credit) Bill; Commentary on the Bill. ISBN 978-0-478-27186-7 CONTENTS Overview 1 Eligiblity for the income-sharing tax credit 3 Calculation of the income-sharing tax credit 5 Payment of the income-sharing tax credit 8 Consequential changes 10 Technical changes 11 1 OVERVIEW Couples with children often face a choice between both parents working full-time, employing others to care for their children, and one parent working full-time and the other staying home to care for the children, possibly on a part-time basis. For most people, financial considerations play a large role in the decision. Introducing an income-sharing tax credit is a way of enabling parents to have greater choice in their work and caring roles and more choice around their work and home-life balance. The Taxation (Income-sharing Tax Credit) Bill introduces a new tax credit for couples with dependent children, based on sharing their incomes equally and paying tax based on half of the shared income. The tax credit will provide additional financial support for couples where one partner is on a higher tax rate than the other. Different couples on the same level of combined income will effectively pay the same combined amount of personal income tax, regardless of how much each partner earns. The changes proposed in the bill will also mean some couples have greater choices to work fewer or more flexible hours of paid work in order to care for children, by increasing their combined after-tax income. Eligible couples with dependent children will be able to apply for the tax credit, if they want, at the end of each tax year. The amount they receive will depend on the relative amounts of tax payable by each partner on their individual income. The tax credit will be the difference between the tax that is payable by each partner on their own incomes, and the amount of tax they would have paid if they each had an equal share in the couple’s combined income. The tax credit could be used to meet any tax owing or be refunded to the couple. The income-sharing tax credit is similar to the Working for Families tax credit and has been designed to share many of the same rules and requirements to help keep administration and compliance costs down. The bill sets out who is eligible, how the tax credit is calculated, and rules around application and payment. Background The topic of income sharing 1 was canvassed in April 2008 in a discussion document, Income splitting for families with children. Options on how to deliver the policy were discussed in an issues paper, An income splitting tax credit for families with children released in December 2009. The tax credit proposed in the bill closely follows the description of the tax credit in the issues paper. Some changes have been made to reflect concerns people raised in submissions, and to simplify administration of the tax credit. Income sharing is a key part of UnitedFuture’s tax policy and formed part of the Confidence and Supply agreement with the National-led Government. The objectives of the income-sharing tax credit, as stated in UnitedFuture’s policy are to: • give parents greater choice in their work and caring roles; 1 Originally referred to as “income splitting” in published documents. 2 • acknowledge the contributions of those who forego paid work to care for children; and • give families with children additional financial support. 3 ELIGIBLITY FOR THE INCOME-SHARING TAX CREDIT (Clause 15) Summary of proposed amendment The bill defines who is eligible to apply for an income-sharing tax credit, and describes the treatment of the credit when couples have separated or who share care. Application date The new provisions will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features New subpart MG is being inserted in the Income Tax Act 2007 to deal with the income-sharing tax credit. Section MG 2 defines who is eligible for the credit. A person applying for the credit must be: • in a “couple relationship” (that is, they are married, in a civil union or in a de facto relationship) for the whole of the tax year; • both partners must be New Zealand tax-residents for the whole of the tax year; and • either they or their partner is the principal caregiver of a dependent child. A dependant child must be: • aged 18 years or under; and • part of the applicant’s family; and • financially dependent on the couple; and • not married, in a civil union or a de facto relationship; and • in school or tertiary education (if 18 years old). If a couple is caring for a dependent child who is from a previous eligible relationship and there is a shared-care arrangement in place between the former partners, a former partner can still qualify as a principal caregiver if they have exclusive care of the child for at least one-third of the year (section MG 6). This is a simpler test than the one that applies to Working for Families tax credits which can apply the one-third test to four-month periods. If both former partners and their new partners meet the requirements of being in a couple relationship, are tax-resident and have at least one- third shared care of the dependent child, both new couples can apply for the tax credit. The tax credit will not be apportioned to reflect the percentage of time each former partner cares for the child. (See Example 2 later in this commentary.) 4 Background The requirements for the income-sharing tax credit are similar to the eligibility requirements for the Working for Families tax credit in that a person must be resident in New Zealand and caring for a dependent child. The key difference is that the person must be in a couple relationship for the whole of the tax year, as the income- sharing tax credit is based on the sharing between partners of income earned during the tax year. The residence test must also be met by both partners for the whole of the tax year, rather than just a portion of it. However, no residence test applies to the child. 5 CALCULATION OF THE INCOME-SHARING TAX CREDIT (Clause 15) Summary of proposed amendment The amount of the tax credit is the difference between the combined amount of tax the couple pays on their income, and the combined amount of tax they would pay if they had each earned half the couple’s combined income. Application date The new provisions will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features Calculating of the tax credit amount is based on the couple sharing their income on a 50/50 basis and calculating the tax payable accordingly, as set out in section MG 3. If the tax they individually pay on their own income is greater than the tax they would pay on the notional sharing of their income, they can claim a tax credit for the difference. This notional sharing applies only for the purpose of the income-sharing tax credit – it will have no impact on any other tax requirements or payments such as child support payments or student loan repayments. If a dependent child starts or stops being a dependent child during the tax year, then the level of the tax credit will be adjusted accordingly as outlined in section MG 5. For example, if a child turns 18 and leaves school at the end of December they will cease to be a dependent child at that point. As they qualified as a dependent child for 75% of the tax year (April to December) the couple would qualify for 75% of the tax credit. Background New Zealand has a progressive marginal tax rate system for income tax. This means that as an individual’s income increases, the rate of tax they pay increases. The table below shows the tax rates for different income brackets for the tax year from 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012. Income Tax rate 0 – 14,000 10.5% 14,001 – 48,000 17.5% 48,001 – 70,000 30% 70,001 and over 33% 6 Not every eligible couple will receive an income-sharing tax credit. They will be eligible for a tax credit only if the partners face a different marginal tax rate on the income they earn. If the partners have different income levels but are still in the same tax bracket and face the same marginal tax rate, they will not benefit from the income- sharing tax credit. Under the current tax rates and thresholds, the maximum amount of an income- sharing tax credit would be $9,080. Special rules apply: if a partner has a tax loss, it will be ignored for the purpose of the calculation and they will be treated as if they earned no income. Other special rules apply for people who are in a transition year where the income they have earned and the tax they have paid is based on a period that is greater or less than a full 12 months – for example, when the income relates to an 18-month period. Example 1 Stacey and Glen are eligible for an income-sharing tax credit as they have been a couple for the whole of a tax year and are both tax-residents. Glen is the principal caregiver of their four- year-old child. Stacey earns $50,000 and pays income tax of $8,020. Stacey’s marginal tax rate is 30%. Glen has had no income for the year and has paid no tax. Their combined income is therefore $50,000 and the combined tax they paid is $8,020. Under the proposed rules, sharing their income means they each have a notional income of $25,000 and would have paid $3,395 each in tax, a combined $6,790. They would qualify for an income-sharing tax credit of $1,230 ($8,020 less $6,790). If instead Stacey earned $30,000 and Glen earned $20,000 they would pay income tax of $4,270 and $2,520 respectively. Their combined income would be $50,000 and their combined tax would be $6,790. While eligible for an income-sharing tax credit, they would not receive any benefit from the tax credit as they are already each paying tax at the same marginal tax rate (17.5%). Sharing their income equally would not reduce the amount of tax payable. 7 Example 2 – When both partners are entitled to an income-sharing tax credit in a shared-care arrangement Andy and Catherine have six-year-old twins. The couple separate in December 2012 and each enters into a new relationship in March 2013. They will not be entitled to an income-sharing tax credit for the 2012–13 tax year, the year in which they separated. For the whole of the following tax year, Andy and Catherine care for the children in alternate weeks. As they each meet the basic requirements and are caring for their children for at least one-third of the time, both are entitled to an income-sharing tax credit for the 2013–14 tax year. Andy is in full-time employment and earns $100,000, on which $23,920 is paid in tax. His new partner is not employed. Catherine’s new partner earns $60,000, on which $11,020 is paid in tax, but she is not employed. Splitting Andy’s and his new partner’s combined taxable income of $100,000 in half gives $50,000. Tax on taxable income of $50,000 is $8,020. If each were to pay this amount, their combined total would be $16,040 in tax paid. The difference between both partners’ tax on combined taxable income and the tax they would pay under income sharing is: $23,920 – $16,040 = $7,880. As for Catherine and her new partner, splitting their combined taxable income of $60,000 in half gives $30,000. Tax on taxable income of $30,000 is $4,270. If this was paid by each, they would pay a total of $8,540 in tax. The difference between their tax on combined taxable income and the tax they would pay under income sharing is: $11,020 – $8,540 = $2,480. 8 PAYMENT OF THE INCOME-SHARING TAX CREDIT (Clause 15) Summary of proposed amendment When they apply for an income-sharing tax credit, couples must nominate who will receive the tax credit or whether it is to be equally shared. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue may retain some or all of the tax credit to offset other tax liabilities that the couple has, such as unpaid tax or overpayments of Working for Families tax credits. Application date The new provisions will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features Section MG 4 sets out that couples will be required to nominate if the full amount of the tax credit should be paid to one of the partners, or whether half the amount is to be paid to each of the partners. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue may, under proposed section MG 7, also retain all or some of the tax credit under certain circumstances – for example, if the couple has an unpaid tax liability. Background People who qualify for Working for Families tax credits have the option of instalment payments during the year based on estimated combined family income, with an end- of-year square up process, or they can apply for an annual tax credit at the end of the tax year based on actual combined family income. Sections LA 2 to LA 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 refer to the treatment of tax credits and the ability to use tax credits to meet unsatisfied income tax liabilities or for them to be transferred for another purpose. The income-sharing tax credit will be available in one payment at the end of the tax year, rather than as an instalment payment throughout the year. Instalment payments are available for Working for Families tax credits because of their focus on income adequacy for low-income families. There are compliance and administration issues associated with estimating income, including incurring and repaying debt. This can be justified for Working for Families tax credits given the scheme’s focus on ensuring families have adequate income. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will have the ability to use the amount of the tax credit to meet unpaid obligations to Inland Revenue, such as recovering an overpayment of Working for Families tax credits, an overpayment of an income- 9 sharing tax credit from a prior year, and meeting unpaid tax liabilities. A partner could also choose to transfer their portion of the tax credit for another purpose. 10 CONSEQUENTIAL CHANGES (Clause 8) Summary of proposed amendment A person who receives an income-sharing tax credit, or a portion of it, will not be eligible for the Independent Earners Tax Credit as this would undermine the purpose of both policies. Application date The provision will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features Section LC 13 (Tax credits for independent earners) will be amended so a person cannot claim an Independent Earners Tax Credit (IETC) if they also receive an income-sharing tax credit. If a person had received an IETC during the year and then applied and received an income-sharing tax credit at the end of the tax year, they would no longer meet the eligibility requirements for an IETC. Background The IETC was introduced in 1 April 2009 to provide a tax credit to people earning between $24,000 and $48,000 in circumstances where they do not receive any other form of Government assistance such as an income-tested benefit or pension, and where they are not entitled to a Working for Families tax credit. The income-sharing tax credit is similar to the Working for Families tax credit in that it is a tax credit to provide additional support for couples with dependent children. Therefore, a person will not be able to receive both the new income-sharing tax credit and an IETC. They would need to pay tax equivalent to the amount of IETC they had received. 11 TECHNICAL CHANGES (Clauses 1 to 12, 14, and 16 to 23) The new tax credit will require minor and technical changes to other parts of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. To claim an income-sharing tax credit, couples will need to confirm their taxable incomes or submit a tax return for the year. An application will be required to claim the tax credit. Definitions in the Income Tax Act 2007 are being updated to take into account the new tax credit. Provisions in these Acts that relate to tax credits are being updated to include the new income-sharing tax credit, where relevant. The changes will apply from 1 April 2012.

It also rewrites the current student loan legislation. The bill replaces the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, and generally applies from 1 April 2012. The changes proposed in the bill are the first part of wider reforms to the tax system to support the Government’s plans for economic growth. Such a tax system should deliver certainty for taxpayers, allow customers to interact with Inland Revenue speedily, provide value for money, and build trust and integrity in the system, leading to high compliance. To achieve this, there must be greater emphasis on improving technology to move taxpayers (or, in this case, student loan borrowers) into an electronic environment with improved services that deliver greater certainty and lower compliance costs for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. The main purpose of the bill is to make it easier for borrowers to manage their loans, pay back what they owe, and encourage earlier repayment. It is not intended as a wider review of student loan scheme policy. The bill also introduces a number of minor policy and technical changes to simplify and improve some functions of the student loan scheme. Transforming the administration of the student loan scheme Transforming the administration of the student loan scheme has three elements. The first is implementing a new loan management solution which will allow borrowers to manage their loans in an electronic environment, giving them a seamless view of their loan from the time they borrow the money to when it is repaid. Improved technological capabilities will also allow Inland Revenue to increase the services it can provide to borrowers. The second element will simplify the loan repayment process by removing the current annual assessment for the vast majority of borrowers whose income is from salary and wages only. Under the proposed changes, repayment deductions made from salary and wages will be considered full and final for the pay-period. To reduce the time borrowers must spend on managing their loan accounts, and to improve the overall service to borrowers, minor under- or over-payments will be ignored. The third element to the administrative reforms will simplify the current interest rule, replace the late payment penalty with less punitive rules and replace the penalty rules for student loans with those applying to other taxes to give more certainty to borrowers. 2 Context The importance of the student loan scheme to the Government is two-fold. While supporting the Government’s commitment to open access to education by providing financial support, the scheme also represents a significant Crown asset, with over 560,000 borrowers and a nominal value of $10.3 billion. The portfolio is currently projected to grow to $14.5 billion by 2014–15, driven by growth in the number of new borrowers. Lending exceeds repayments and there is evidence that borrowers’ compliance with their repayment obligations is declining as student loan debt continues to grow. Administration of the student loan scheme is complex, with multiple organisations administering parts of the scheme. This means borrowers must interact with a number of administrators, sometimes making it difficult for borrowers to have a clear view of their overall loan position. Inland Revenue collects student loan repayments, on a system originally designed to collect tax. It is largely paper-based, requires annual assessments, and is complex and inflexible. The policy of annual assessment results in a complicated annual interaction with borrowers and generates compliance and administration costs. The paper-based system also presents difficulties in maintaining communication with borrowers who are based overseas. Transforming Inland Revenue’s administration of the student loan scheme from paper-based to more electronic communication with borrowers seeks to address these problems. Application date The majority of the changes will apply from 1 April 2012. 3 Moving borrowers to an electronic environment 4 5 ELECTRONIC ADMINISTRATION OF THE STUDENT LOAN SCHEME (Clauses 10 to 15, and 203 to 207) Summary of proposed amendments The bill contains amendments to allow information and notices to be provided electronically to borrowers and enable borrowers to access and manage their loan from anywhere and at anytime. Similarly, borrowers sending information to Inland Revenue, such as changes to their personal details and elections, will do so by electronic means. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 January 2012. Key features The proposed amendments introduce changes that will allow borrowers to manage their loan accounts by interacting with Inland Revenue electronically. As well as having online access to up-to-date loan information 24-hours a day anywhere in the world, borrowers will be able to communicate with Inland Revenue electronically to manage their loans. Background Some borrowers cannot easily contact Inland Revenue about their loan, especially if they are based overseas. Also most student loan scheme processes are paper-based. In addition, the student loan scheme repayment system is based on a computer system designed for tax collection. It is therefore difficult and expensive to administer, and requires significant resources to deal with system-generated errors. A new loan management solution will offer borrowers the advantages of a modern electronic environment and allow Inland Revenue to deliver improved services to borrowers. A modern electronic environment provides borrowers with services tailored to suit individual needs, the ability to access relevant personal information and make it easier for borrowers to manage their loans with greater certainty. The main benefits for borrowers are: • increased certainty and reduced compliance costs; • fewer contacts that have to be made and easier electronic communication with Inland Revenue; • improved quality of information for both borrowers and Inland Revenue; • faster processing times by Inland Revenue; and • improved timeliness and accuracy of responses to borrowers. 6 CONSOLIDATED VIEW OF TOTAL LOAN BALANCE, AND TRANSFERRING INFORMATION AND LOAN ADVANCES (Clauses 10 to 15) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments deal with how information is to be shared between the loan manager and Inland Revenue, and enable Inland Revenue to provide borrowers with a consolidated view of their total loan balance. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 January 2012. Key features The amendments introduce the following changes: • Inland Revenue will provide borrowers with a consolidated view of their total loan balance, removing the need to contact two agencies to obtain this information; • the near real-time transfer of a borrower’s loan advance information and contact details from the loan manager to Inland Revenue. As loan advances are drawn down or borrowers’ contact details are changed, this information will be transferred to Inland Revenue to keep borrowers better informed of their loan details and obligations. Inland Revenue will inform borrowers of their total loan balance by providing them with access to view their loan on an internet site; and • the sharing of information between the loan manager and Inland Revenue about people applying for student loans to confirm the applicant’s identity and to prevent fraud and ensure loans are assigned to the correct borrowers. 7 Background Currently, student loans are transferred once a year from the loan manager to Inland Revenue, generally in February each calendar year. This annual transfer makes it difficult for borrowers to ascertain their total level of borrowings at any given time, particularly if they are still studying, and therefore possibly regularly drawing down on the loan. Borrowers are sent statements of their loan balances from both the loan manager and Inland Revenue or have to go to the two organisations’ websites to view this information. The proposed near real-time transfer of information will allow borrowers to easily access timely information about their total amount of student loan from a single website which will be managed by Inland Revenue. The transfer of information will also allow Inland Revenue to maintain more up-to-date contact details for student loan borrowers. Often borrowers change their contact details frequently and it is difficult for Inland Revenue to maintain current contact details for all borrowers. The contact details being transferred will also include electronic addresses, when these are available. Consultation on the major policy reforms proposed in this bill showed considerable support for electronic communication. The transfer of electronic contact details will help facilitate this. 8 INFORMING AND NOTIFYING BORROWERS (Clauses 203 to 207) Summary of proposed amendments The bill will change the way Inland Revenue communicates with borrowers. The most significant change provides Inland Revenue with greater use of electronic channels when communicating with borrowers, making it easier for borrowers to manage their loans and lowering administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Application date Most amendments will apply from 1 April 2012, while changes to the transfer of the consolidated loan balance will apply from 1 January 2012. Key features The amendments introduce the following changes: • Inland Revenue will communicate with borrowers electronically when an active email address is available; • Inland Revenue will make as many services as possible available electronically to enable borrowers to self manage their loans; and • Inland Revenue will provide borrowers with personal access to information about their loan on the Inland Revenue website. There will be four different ways for Inland Revenue, borrowers and employers to communicate with each other. These are to inform, notify, notify a person in writing, and formally notify. “Inform” means for Inland Revenue to provide information to the borrower in a passive way, typically by providing a website or physical service where borrowers can access relevant information, or by giving public notice. For example, when Inland Revenue communicates with borrowers on matters that do not need to be specifically brought to a person’s attention, and when it is appropriate for a borrower to access the information at their convenience. It will be used mainly to provide borrowers with a consolidated view of their total loan balance, but also to provide general information – for example, a change to the repayment threshold. “Notify” means for the borrower or Inland Revenue to actively communicate information through a broad range of methods. This can be notified by paper, by telephone, in person, by electronic means, or any other manner acceptable to the Commissioner. This method will be used when a degree of flexibility over the form of communication is appropriate because of the type of information required. For example when a borrower is required to notify Inland Revenue about an absence from New Zealand. If a borrower is notified through a borrower portal on the Inland Revenue website, the Commissioner will also have to draw the borrower’s attention to the 9 information being available on the web by sending a text message or email to the borrower. “Notify a person in writing” means to communicate using the methods available in “Notify”, including by electronic means such as an email, but excludes in person or by phone. This form of communication will be used to communicate with borrowers in a formal way, when it is not appropriate for the information to be communicated in person or by phone. It may be used, for example, to notify borrowers of an assessment, that they have an unpaid amount that must be paid, or that late payment interest has been changed. “Formally notify” means to communicate to borrowers in writing and on paper. Electronic communications are excluded from this definition. Although it is used infrequently throughout the bill, an example of this type of communication is outlined in clause 162, which provides for the escalation of objections to the chief executive of the Ministry of Social Development. If a borrower wishes to escalate an objection under this provision, they are required to formally notify the chief executive of this in writing. Background The current student loan notification requirements for Inland Revenue are very restrictive and often must be in the form of a formal letter. Currently, Inland Revenue sends out 26 million letters a year, including letters to student loan borrowers, largely because of these and similar restrictions. The proposed changes to the form of communication allowed should provide greater flexibility so Inland Revenue can tailor services to the needs of borrowers, and adapt as new channels of communication become common. They will also allow much more extensive use of electronic communications, a move strongly supported during consultation with borrowers. It will particularly benefit borrowers who are based overseas, who are often mobile, and who because of international timelines, find it difficult to contact Inland Revenue during working hours. 10 Methods of meeting repayment obligations 11 12 PAY-PERIOD REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS (Clauses 28 to 65) Under the bill the method of meeting a repayment obligation differs depending on the type of income. There are three classes of income: • salary or wages, the treatment of which is outlined in the following six sections; • pre-taxed income (for example, interest and dividend income), which are outlined in the Pre-tax repayment obligation section; and • other income (for example, business or rental income), which is outlined in the Alignment with provisional tax payment dates for borrowers required to file a return of income section. Summary of proposed amendments For salary and wages earners, who make up the majority of borrowers, the bill proposes removing the annual assessment process (or “square-up”), and deductions from their salary and wages will be treated as satisfying their repayment obligations on a pay- period basis. Salary and wage earners will continue to have deductions made for student loan repayments from that income. The deductions will continue to be calculated as they are now: (pay-period salary or wage – pay-period repayment threshold) x repayment percentage For the majority of borrowers whose income is largely from salary or wages, the amount deducted for a pay-period will be the borrower’s final repayment obligation for that pay. This will provide certainty every pay-day that the repayment obligation has been met. This means there will be no annual square-up for these borrowers. This should result in a reduction of overdue debt assessments, and a significant reduction in compliance and administration costs. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features The amendments introduce changes that will: • remove the annual assessment process for the majority of borrowers; • remove annual under-payments and debts for the majority of borrowers; • provide more certainty for borrowers that they have met their repayment obligation; and • lower compliance and administration costs. 13 The bill introduces two new concepts. The first is to treat some types of income differently for different borrowers. This means different rules for salary and wage earners compared with other borrowers, to ensure the rules are tailored for each group. Secondly, the bill emphasises a pragmatic approach to the previous annual assessment process. This means that for borrowers with salary or wage income only or those with a mix of pre-taxed income and salary or wage income, small under-deductions will not be actioned and small over-deductions will not be refunded. Instead, these will be applied towards the loan balance. This system will invariably produce instances where borrowers may be better or worse off than in an annual system. Overall, however, these borrowers will benefit because the new system provides greater certainty and improved services. Background Although for some borrowers the annual assessment process provides certainty of liability, it imposes compliance costs for the majority of borrowers and administration costs for Inland Revenue. The annual assessment generates a large and increasing number of contacts between borrowers and Inland Revenue, which reduces the extent to which Inland Revenue can provide higher value services to borrowers. It is a more appropriate mechanism for a period-based tax such as income tax where accuracy is important and timeliness is less so. It may be a less appropriate mechanism for the majority of borrowers for whom a high degree of accuracy is not required but greater emphasis on timeliness is required – for example, salary or wage earners. For these reasons, the annual assessment requirement will be removed for individual borrowers and greater emphasis placed on accurate deductions during the year. 14 UNUSED REPAYMENT THRESHOLD TRANSFER FOR SECONDARY JOBS (Clauses 35 to 42) Summary of proposed amendments The bill contains amendments to allow borrowers whose income is solely from salary or wages, 1 who have two or more jobs at the same time and whose income from their main job is under the repayment threshold 2 to apply for and use any unused repayment threshold from their main job against their secondary jobs. Under the general deduction rules, deductions are made from a borrower’s main job at 10 percent of each dollar of income over the pay-period repayment threshold and at 10 percent of each dollar of income from each of a borrower’s secondary jobs. The amendment allows borrowers who would otherwise be subject to higher deductions to be treated the same as borrowers who earn an equivalent income from one job. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features The bill introduces the following changes: • borrowers with secondary jobs may use any unused repayment threshold currently $19,084 from their main job to reduce deductions from second jobs; • borrowers must apply to Inland Revenue prospectively to use this facility; • borrowers must estimate income each quarter; and • borrowers who do not apply must have deductions from secondary jobs at 10 percent of each dollar of salary and wages. Detailed analysis Borrowers who earn salary or wages and/or pre-taxed income only, earn less than the pay-period repayment threshold from their main job, and have job(s) will be able to apply the unused repayment threshold from their main job to their second job. The unused repayment threshold is the difference between the estimated pay-period income from the main job and the pay-period repayment threshold. If the borrower does not make use of this option, repayment deductions will be made from the first dollar of income from the secondary jobs as currently applies under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992. 1 This group also includes borrowers who receive salary and wages and pre-taxed income only. 2 The repayment threshold is the income threshold below which borrowers are not required to make loan repayments. Currently this threshold is $19,084 for the 2010-11 tax year. 15 Clauses 36 to 42 set out the criteria, application process and the obligations for borrowers who wish to take advantage of this option. Applications must be prospective. This option is not available to borrowers who are required to file a return of income for tax purposes (that is, borrowers that have a mixture of salary and wages, and business- type income). As is the case now, these borrowers can apply for a special deduction rate for their salary and wages to ensure that during the year they do not have deductions made that are more than required, or may receive a refund, if applicable, when their annual assessment is completed. Borrowers applying to use an unused repayment threshold must make a fair and reasonable estimate of their income for the next quarter. They may re-estimate their income during the quarter and must do so if the original estimate is no longer fair and reasonable. Inland Revenue will determine the un-used threshold and the appropriate deduction rate to be applied to the secondary income. A special deduction rate certificate will be issued to the borrower, setting out the new deduction rate, the period to which it should be applied, and requiring the borrower’s employer to make deductions at the new rate. The certificate replaces any other deduction code or rate in place at the time and ceases to have effect, either at the end of the period specified in the certificate or on the date notified by the Commissioner or the borrower. Example Kate has two jobs and a student loan. In her main job, she works as a part-time lab technician and earns $260 to $320 each week, depending on what shifts she is given. Her second job is for a nursing service company where she is employed to provide care for an elderly person. She earns between $150 and $250 a fortnight. On 12 April 2011 Kate applies to transfer any “unused’ repayment threshold from her main job to her secondary job. While her wages fluctuate, she has no reason to expect that her income will change significantly over the next three months. Therefore, she uses what she earned in the last month as the basis for a reasonable estimate of her income over the next three months – $280 a week from the laboratory and $194 a fortnight from her second job. In response to her application, Inland Revenue confirms that she has an “unused” repayment threshold of $87 a week (that is, the weekly repayment threshold of $367 minus her average weekly wage of $280) to transfer from her main job to her second job. Because Kate’s second job is paid fortnightly the weekly unused repayment threshold of $87 is converted to a fortnightly amount of $174. Inland Revenue issues Kate a special deduction rate certificate to provide to the nursing care company that specifies the deduction rate to be applied to her second job from her next pay onwards. The deduction rate has been determined as follows: • expected amount of repayments each fortnight are ($194 – $174) x 10% = $2; • deduction rate to be applied to each dollar of fortnightly salary to get the appropriate deduction is $2/$194 = 1 %. On 14 May 2011 Kate accepts a promotion to a supervisor role in the laboratory and her weekly wage increases to $400 a week. Because her primary income has increased Kate is required to re-estimate her income and inform Inland Revenue of the change. When she does this, she is advised that the special deduction rate will no longer apply to her income from the second job. This is because she no longer has an unused repayment threshold to use, as her increased wage from her main job is more than the pay-period threshold. She is required to tell the nursing care company that the special deduction rate no longer applies. She does this and the nursing care company starts future repayment deductions from the first dollar of income from that job. As Kate’s wage from her main job has increased and is now over the pay-period threshold, the laboratory will automatically start deductions at 10% of each dollar over the pay-period repayment threshold. 16 Background Currently, borrowers with secondary employment earnings have repayment deductions made at 10% from the first dollar of income from their secondary jobs. They can currently apply for a special deduction rate to apply to their secondary income so that the deductions don’t exceed their estimated repayment obligation for the year, or request a refund of any excess repayments made when the annual assessment has been completed. The new provisions will be available when the annual assessment for salary or wages has been removed for borrowers. This will ensure that those borrowers do not have too much deducted from their salary or wages. 17 SALARY AND WAGE DEDUCTION EXEMPTION FOR FULL-TIME, FULL-YEAR STUDENTS (Clauses 48 to 54) Summary of proposed amendments The bill provides an exemption to the requirement for borrowers to have salary and wage deductions. This exemption is for borrowers who are full-time, full-year students who expect to earn less than the annual repayment threshold (currently $19,084). Borrowers can apply for this exemption by making a prospective declaration stating that they reasonably expect their income to be less than the annual repayment threshold for the relevant tax year so they are not to be burdened by repayments. This retains the current treatment of these borrowers. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features The amendments introduce the following changes: • full-time, full-year students who expect to earn under the annual repayment threshold can apply for an exemption from having student loan deductions; and • borrowers must apply for the exemption prospectively. Detailed analysis Borrowers can make a declaration in accordance with clause 49 that they are in full-time study for the full-year and that they reasonably expect their income will not exceed the annual repayment threshold for the relevant tax year. The declaration must be prospective. Clauses 48 to 54 set out the criteria, process and the obligations on borrowers who wish to take advantage of this option to prevent repayments being deducted from their salary and wages. Clause 48 specifies the criteria that a borrower must meet to be eligible for this exemption. The exemption is not available to borrowers who are required to file a return of income for tax purposes (such as borrowers who have a mixture of salary and wages, and business-type income). As is the case now, these borrowers can apply for a special deduction rate for their salary and wages or may receive a refund, if applicable, when their annual assessment is completed. The exemption is not intended to provide a blanket exemption for borrowers in full-time study. 18 At the time of the declaration, the borrower must expect to meet the criteria for a particular tax year. The link between the required period of study and a particular tax year is necessary in order to measure a borrower’s annual income to determine whether they have earned more than the annual repayment threshold. Upon receiving a declaration from a borrower, Inland Revenue will provide a notice to the borrower setting out the period to which the exemption applies. When the borrower notifies their employer that they have been granted an exemption, the employer must not make standard student loan deductions from the borrower’s salary and wages. The borrower or the Commissioner can still request an employer to make extra deductions. Borrowers may withdraw their declaration by notifying Inland Revenue and their employer, and must do so as soon as practicable if they will no longer meet the criteria. The exemption ceases to apply at the earlier of the end of the period stated in the notice to the borrower or the date on which the borrower withdraws their declaration, or the date of the change in circumstances. Example 1 Sam decides to study for a post-graduate qualification. His course starts on 4 March 2013 and is expected to finish at the end of November 2013. It is more than 80 percent of the full-time equivalent study and the course duration is more than 32 weeks, and he therefore meets the full- time, full-year criteria for an exemption for the 2013–14 tax year. He intends to find employment during term breaks in April, June and December to reduce the amount he needs to borrow. He has no other income and he does not expect to earn more than the annual repayment threshold for the 2013–14 tax year. Sam applies in March 2013 for an exemption and is granted one for the 2013–14 tax year. When Sam begins work in April he provides his employer with the notice granting him the exemption and his employer does not make student loan repayment deductions from his wages. In the December term break Sam’s job changes and his wages increase to the point that his income for the year will exceed the annual repayment threshold. Sam must now notify his employer and Inland Revenue that he is no longer eligible for an exemption. He does so and is also required to notify his employer of the student loan repayment code that must follow his tax code. Sam’s employer starts student loan repayment deductions from his wages at 10% of each dollar over the pay-period repayment threshold. Example 2 Holly decides to study for a degree. She intends to start her course half-way through the year in July 2013. Her course finishes in November 2013. She intends to enrol for the following year from March 2014. Her course is 80% of equivalent full-time study and she expects to earn under the annual repayment threshold for the 2013–14 tax year. The length of her course precludes her from being eligible for an exemption in the 2013–14 tax year because the course is less than 32 weeks in duration in that year. 19 Background Currently borrowers who work for short periods while studying and who expect their annual income to be less than the annual repayment threshold are not required to advise their employer that they are a borrower. Subsequently, they do not have deductions made from their salary and wages. However, because the changes introduced in the bill will remove the annual assessment for the majority of borrowers, any borrower who earns over the weekly threshold will be subject to student loan deductions. For students who take up employment during their holidays, this could limit their earnings and increase the amount they need to borrow. This point came through strongly during public consultation, with many comments arguing that an exemption for full-time, full- year students was warranted. The policy for the exemption is to provide relief for borrowers who are in full-time study and earn over the pay-period repayment threshold during term breaks, but whose total income for the year is below the annual repayment threshold. This means that in practice, full-time, full-year students with student loans will be treated in the same way as they are now and will not be required to have deductions made from their salary or wages. 20 SIGNIFICANT UNDER- AND OVER-DEDUCTIONS (Clauses 46 and 47, 57 to 62) Summary of proposed amendments The bill contains amendments that allow the Commissioner not to take corrective action for under- and over-deductions of student loan repayments unless the amounts are considered to be significant. For the vast majority of borrowers, whose income is largely from salary and wages, loan repayment deductions will be treated as having satisfied the borrower’s repayment obligations on a pay-period basis. In some circumstances PAYE and employer errors can result in inaccurate deductions, resulting in either under- or over-deductions. Under the proposed changes in the bill, unless the under- or over-deductions are significant, the Commissioner will not take action to refund or seek further repayments. Clause 57 allows the Commissioner to have the discretion to set thresholds for corrective action. This will enable more significant employer errors to be rectified by refunds for significant over-deductions, or extra deductions from the borrower’s future salary and wages for under-deductions. If extra deductions cannot be made from future salary or wages – for example, because the borrower is no longer working, clauses 46 and 47 enable the Commissioner to make an assessment of the amount of under- deduction that ought to have been paid with a requirement that the amount assessed be paid by a due date. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features The bill introduces the following changes: • Commissioner-set thresholds for not taking action on under- and over-deductions, unless they are significant; • the Commissioner must inform borrowers of the thresholds each year; • borrowers can request the Commissioner determine if a significant over-deduction has been made; • borrowers can request a refund for a significant over-deduction; • the Commissioner can collect significant under-deductions from future salary and wages; and 21 • the Commissioner can issue a special assessment with a specific due date when it is not possible or not appropriate to collect under-deductions from a borrower’s future salary and wages. Background The discretion to set thresholds for taking corrective action in relation to incorrect deductions is one of the core principles underlying the student loan scheme reforms. This discretion will provide the flexibility to manage any risks to the integrity of the student loan scheme, while taking into account overall administrative resources. This discretion will also be coupled with accountability, by publishing any thresholds set by the Commissioner to ensure transparency. 22 EXTRA DEDUCTIONS FROM SALARY AND WAGES (Clauses 33 and 43 to 45) Summary of proposed amendments The bill allows Inland Revenue or borrowers to request employers to make additional student loan deductions from a borrower’s salary or wage, using a new “SLADR” tax code. Clauses 33 and 43 to 45 set out the rules in relation to these deductions. Borrowers may ask their employer make extra deductions at an extra deduction rate or a specific amount. This may be because the borrower wishes to pay unpaid amounts or to make excess repayments to reduce their loan balance which may qualify for the 10% excess repayment bonus. The Commissioner may require extra deductions if a borrower has not had enough deducted through the standard deductions – for example, when a borrower has had a significant under-deduction identified, or to collect unpaid amounts when collection of the unpaid amount through other means has been unsuccessful. As well as these extra deductions, employers will still be required to deduct the standard deductions for the same pay-periods. The changes will allow Inland Revenue to more accurately administer repayments. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features The bill introduces the following changes: • the Commissioner may request extra deductions for either significant under- deductions or unpaid amounts; • the Commissioner can request a deduction up to 5% in addition to the standard deduction rate of 10%; • borrowers can also request extra deductions; and • extra deductions must be made using the new tax code “SLADR” to separately identify them. Background While the current legislation allows extra deductions to be made, the bill proposes that a different tax deduction code be used to clearly identify these deductions as separate from the standard “SL” tax code or special deduction rate deductions. 23 With the removal of the annual assessment for the majority of borrowers, it is necessary to distinguish the extra deductions from standard deductions so they can be applied to the purpose they were intended, rather than being treated as meeting a salary or wage repayment obligation, such as making excess repayments or repaying unpaid amounts. Having the new “SLADR” tax code will enable Inland Revenue to more accurately identify and administer additional repayments. 24 SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS (Clauses 46 and 47) Summary of proposed amendments To ensure the integrity of the salary or wage repayment deduction process, the bill contains amendments that will allow the Commissioner to make an assessment to determine the deductions that ought to have been made from a borrower’s salary and wages and require payment of that amount in 30 days. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features Under clause 46 the Commissioner will be able to make an assessment to determine the amount of deductions a borrower should have had deducted from their salary or wages and which has not been collected through other means. The Commissioner will be able to make a special assessment in relation to borrowers who earn salary or wage income, or salary and wage and pre-taxed income such as dividend or interest income. Special assessments will be able to be used when: • a borrower has prevented extra deductions from being made to repay a significant under-deduction; • the Commissioner is unable to obtain extra deductions from future salary or wages from a borrower within a reasonable period of time to repay a significant under- deduction; or • a borrower has caused standard deductions not to be made through their action or inaction, whether deliberate or not. Borrowers will be notified that a special assessment has been carried out, the amount that has been assessed, and the due date by which the assessed amount must be made. The due date must be at least 30 days after the assessment has been made. If the assessed amount is not paid in full by the due date it will be treated as an unpaid amount and subject to late payment interest from the due date. The assessment will not be used for borrowers who are required to file a return of income for tax purposes (for example, borrowers who have a mixture of salary and wages, and business-type income). These borrowers’ repayment obligations will be determined on an annual basis, as they are now. 25 Background Under the student loan scheme reforms, the vast majority of borrowers will be considered to have met their salary or wage repayment obligation on a pay-period basis through the deductions made by their employer. Generally, employers will make the correct deductions each pay-period. From time to time, however, there may be circumstances when there has been a significant under-deduction that the Commissioner has been unable to collect or considers will be unable to collect within a reasonable timeframe through extra deductions. In these situations, and when a borrower has caused standard deductions not to be made, a process is required to ensure that signficiant under-deductions are collected. 26 PRE-TAXED REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS (Clauses 4 and 66 to 80) Summary of proposed amendments The bill provides a separate loan repayment mechanism for borrowers who have pre- taxed income, such as income from interest or dividends, or salary or wages from casual agricultural employment or election day employment and do not have to file an annual return for tax purposes. These borrowers will now be required to make an online declaration of their pre-taxed income. The bill also sets out how and when their repayment obligation must be paid. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features “Pre-taxed income” is income that is not required to have student loan deductions made from it. It is defined as interest, dividends, a taxable Māori authority distribution, a personal service rehabilitation payment, salary or wages from employment as a casual agricultural employee or as an election day worker. A new pre-taxed loan repayment obligation will apply to borrowers who have either a mixture of pre-taxed income and salary or wages, or who have solely pre-taxed income and who are not required to file a return of income. The pre-taxed loan repayment obligation process is designed to assess and collect repayments relating to income derived from sources that are not required to have student loan deductions made when the borrower would not otherwise be required to declare that income for tax purposes as income tax has already been withheld from it. The pre-taxed income repayment obligation does not apply to borrowers who are required to file a return of income for tax purposes (that is, borrowers that have a mixture of salary and wages, business-type income, and pre-taxed income). Repayment obligations for those borrowers are determined on an annual basis, taking into account income they derive from all sources, as currently happens. Deductions for certain types of expenditure will be allowed to be offset against a borrower’s pre-taxed income before determining the borrower’s pre-taxed loan repayment obligation. These types of expenditure are set out in the definition of “allowable expenses” in clause 4. The result of offsetting these expenses will be the borrower’s net pre-taxed income. The pre-taxed loan repayment obligation will apply to borrowers who earn $1,500 or more net pre-taxed income for a tax year and whose combined income from net pre- taxed income and salary or wages for a tax year is $1,500 or more than the annual repayment threshold. 27 The annual assessment to determine a borrower’s pre-taxed income repayment obligations will not include deductions from salary or wages. Borrowers who derive pre-taxed income and salary or wages will have the deductions from their salary and wages treated as satisfying their repayment obligations for that income on a pay-period basis. Detailed analysis Declaration and assessment of pre-taxed income Borrowers will no longer have to file an annual return and instead will make an annual declaration of pre-taxed income in a prescribed electronic format either on 7 July following the tax year in which the income was received, or a later date if the borrower has an extension of time to declare their pre-taxed income. The Commissioner will make an assessment of a borrower’s repayment obligations in relation to pre-taxed income from the information contained in the declaration, and the information Inland Revenue holds relating to the borrower’s salary or wage income. Borrowers must be notified of the amount assessed. This may be done electronically. Calculation and payment of pre-taxed loan repayment obligations The pre-taxed loan repayment obligation is calculated differently depending on the amount of a borrower’s salary or wage income for the tax year. The pre-taxed loan repayment obligation for borrowers who have salary or wage income for a tax year that is equal to or greater than the annual repayment threshold, is calculated by multiplying the net pre-taxed income by the loan repayment percentage. The calculation is modified slightly for borrowers whose salary and wage income is less than the annual repayment threshold. For these borrowers, an adjustment will be made for the difference between the annual repayment threshold and their salary or wage income to give those borrowers the full benefit of the annual repayment threshold. The borrower’s pre-taxed repayment obligation will be used to determine whether they are required to make interim payments for the next tax year, and whether they are required to pay any outstanding pre-taxed repayment obligation by one due date or will be able to spread the payment over a number of due dates. Remaining repayments and due dates Remaining repayments are the difference between the borrower’s actual pre-taxed loan repayment obligation, calculated at the annual assessment, and the amount the borrower paid towards their loan repayment obligation for that tax year. The dates on which remaining repayments are due to be paid depends on the size of the borrower’s pre-taxed loan repayment obligation and whether they estimated their pre- taxed repayment obligation for the tax year. 28 Pre-taxed loan repayment obligations less than $1,000 If a borrower’s pre-taxed repayment obligation for a tax year is less than $1,000, the borrower must make one remaining repayment which is calculated using the formula in clauses 74(2) and (3). The one remaining repayment for this group of borrowers will be due on the next provisional tax date that corresponds to the borrower’s balance date, and that immediately follows the date on which the borrower was required to file their declaration of pre-taxed income for the tax year. This is regardless of whether the borrower is liable for provisional tax. If a borrower has an extension of time to file their declaration of pre-taxed income, the remaining loan repayment is due on the next date in columns B, D, or F of schedule 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. For example, borrowers with a March balance date who therefore are required to file their declaration on 7 July and have a loan repayment obligation of less than $1,000, will have one remaining repayment due on 28 August of that year. If the same borrower had an extension to file a declaration by 31 March the next year, the remaining repayment would be due on 7 May in that next year. Pre-taxed loan repayment obligations between $1,000 and $16,000 If a borrower’s pre-taxed loan repayment obligation for a tax year is $1,000 or more the borrower must make three remaining repayments using the formula in clauses 74(2) and (3). The remaining repayment dates for this group of borrowers must be made on each of the interim payment dates that immediately follow the date the borrower was required to file their declaration of pre-taxed income for the tax year. As a result these payments may be made on interim payment dates that fall due for the following tax year. These dates are outlined in columns B, D, and F of the table “Payment of provisional tax and terminal tax” in schedule 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. For example, for borrowers with a March balance date who file their declaration on 7 July, the remaining payments will be due on the following dates, 28 August, 15 January and 7 May, being the same dates the borrower would be required to make interim payments for the next tax year. If the same borrower had an extension to file their declaration by 31 March the next year, the remaining repayments would be due on 7 May, 28 August in that next year, and 15 January in the following year. Pre-taxed loan repayment obligations of $16,000 or more, or estimated If the borrower has a pre-taxed loan repayment obligation for the year of $16,000 or more, or has estimated their loan repayment obligations, their payments are due to be paid on the three interim payment dates for that year. Therefore, any difference between what was required to be paid as interim payments and what was liable to be paid for the year, is overdue and subject to late payment interest as unpaid amounts from the dates they were due. For example, if a borrower either estimated their pre-taxed repayment obligation or has a pre-taxed repayment obligation for a tax year of $16,000 or more for the 2012–13 tax year, they were required to make three interim payments on 28 August 2012, 15 January 2013 and 7 May 2013. The borrower completes their declaration on 7 July 2013 and as a result their interim payments are less than their repayment obligation for the year. The difference (remaining repayments) is due on the interim payment dates for the year, being 28 August 2012, 15 January 2013 and 7 May 2013. As these dates have passed, interest is charged on the amounts due at those dates. This provides an incentive for 29 borrowers to calculate and pay the correct amount, and is the same treatment that applies for provisional tax payments. Interim payments Borrowers with a pre-taxed loan repayment obligation of $1,000 or more for a tax year will be required to make interim payments for the following year to limit the likelihood of a large underpayment of their repayment obligation for that tax year. These interim payments are due on the three standard provisional tax payment dates. For borrowers with a March balance date, interim payments are due on 28 August, 15 January and 7 May. (For more information on the timing of interim payments, see the next section, Alignment with provisional tax payment dates for borrowers required to file a return of income.) Borrowers with a pre-taxed loan repayment obligation for a tax year of less than $1,000 will not be required make interim repayments towards the next tax year’s pre-taxed loan repayment obligation. This is in line with the rules that apply to borrowers who are required to file a return of income for tax purposes. Borrowers who are required to make interim payments can calculate them using one of two methods: the standard method or estimate their loan repayment obligation. For borrowers who use the standard method, their interim repayments are based on the previous tax year’s pre-taxed loan repayment obligation uplifted by 5% (or if the borrower has not filed their declaration of pre-taxed income for the previous year, the pre-taxed repayment obligation for the tax year that immediately precedes the previous tax year is uplifted by 10%). The uplifted amount is then divided by the number of interim payments the borrower is required to make. If a borrower estimates their pre-taxed income loan repayment obligation, the interim payments are calculated according to the formula in clause 76(2). The dates when interim payments are due align with the due dates for the payment of provisional tax. The specific dates will depend on the borrower’s balance date and on whether the tax year is a transitional year for the borrower. For most borrowers with a March balance date, those dates would be 28 August, 15 January and 7 May. Example Peter has salary or wage income of $30,000 which is above the repayment threshold of $19,084. Student loan repayment deductions are correctly made from his salary or wage income. Peter also earns $15,000 of interest income for the 2012–13 tax year and files his pre-taxed income declaration on 7 July 2013. Peter has made no payments towards his pre-taxed repayment obligation during the year. The Commissioner assesses Peter’s pre-taxed repayment obligation at $1,500, being 10% of his interest income which is required to be paid in three remaining repayments on 28 August 2013, 15 January 2014 and 7 May 2014. Peter will also be required to pay interim payments for the 2013–14 tax year. Peter’s interim payments for the 2013–14 year are 105% of his pre-taxed loan repayment obligation for the 2012–13 tax year: 105% x $1,500 = $1,575 divided by the number of due dates. His interim repayments are due on three dates and so one-third ($525) is due on each of the following dates – 28 August 2013, 15 January 2014 and 7 May 2014. 30 Background Because the annual assessment process for the vast majority of borrowers is being removed, borrowers who have income from sources that are not required to have student loan deductions made from them, and who are not required to file a return of income for tax purposes will now need to file a declaration of pre-taxed income and make loan repayments similar to provisional tax payments. 31 ALIGNMENT WITH PROVISIONAL TAX PAYMENT DATES FOR BORROWERS REQUIRED TO FILE A RETURN OF INCOME (Clauses 81 to 96 and 106) Summary of proposed amendments The bill contains amendments to generally align the payment of interim payments for student loans with the provisional tax payment dates for borrowers who are required to file a return of income for tax purposes. Amendments also allow certain borrowers to pay any outstanding loan repayment obligation for a tax year over a number of due dates. The changes apply to borrowers who are required to file a return of income because, for example, they have business income. Application date The amendments will apply for the 2012 tax year and subsequent tax years. Key features Borrowers who are required to file a return of income for tax purposes will be required to meet their student loan repayment obligations in a similar manner to their income tax obligations. The due dates for student loan repayment obligations for this group of borrowers will generally be aligned with provisional tax payment dates. These borrowers will continue to have standard deductions from their salary or wages, and will continue to have an annual assessment to determine their repayment obligations. This will include a square-up of all their income (including salary or wages, and pre-taxed income) and repayments, including deductions from their salary and wages in the same way they do currently. There are no changes to the annual return and assessment process except that the Commissioner may notify borrowers electronically of the amount assessed. Borrowers who are required to notify the Commissioner of their world-wide income under clause 106 will also be required to meet their repayment obligations in the same manner as borrowers required to file a return of income for tax purposes. Detailed analysis Calculation of “other income” loan repayment obligations Borrowers who have net income for a tax year equal to or less than the annual repayment threshold will have no other income loan repayment obligation for that tax year. 32 Borrowers who have net income for a tax year that is more than the annual repayment threshold will have their “other income” repayment obligation for that tax year determined as follows: Other income repayment = \[10% x (Net income – annual repayment threshold)\] – salary and wage deductions obligation The borrower’s other income loan repayment obligation will be used to determine whether they are required to make interim payments for the next tax year, and whether they are required to pay any remaining repayments by one due date or whether it is paid over a number of due dates. Example Helen has net income for the tax year of $42,000, comprising $30,000 in salary income and $12,000 from a rental property. The student loan deductions from her salary and wages amount to $1,000. Because Helen had income from a rental property, she is required to file a return of income for tax purposes. When she files her return of income her other income repayment obligation is calculated as follows: other income repayment obligation = \[10% x ($42,000 – $19,084)\] – $1,000 = $1,291.60 Remaining repayments and due dates A borrower is required to make remaining repayment(s) if their repayment obligation for the year is greater than the amount they paid, such as interim payments and salary or wage deductions during the year. The calculation method is outlined in clause 86. A borrower’s remaining repayments and the dates these are due to be paid depend on the size of the borrower’s other income repayment obligation and whether they had estimated their other income repayment obligation for the tax year. If a borrower’s other income loan repayment obligation for a tax year is less than $1,000, the borrower is required to make one remaining repayment which is calculated using the formula in clauses 86(2) and (3). The remaining repayment for this group of borrowers will be due on the provisional tax due date that immediately follows the date the borrower was required to file a return of income for the tax year. If the borrower’s other income loan repayment obligation is $1,000 or more, they are required to make remainder repayments on the same dates as their provisional tax is due (except if they use the GST ratio method to calculate provisional tax they pay on 28 August, 15 January and 7 May). If a borrower has an extension of time to file their return of income, and has not used the estimation method to determine their interim payments, the remaining repayments are due on the provisional tax due dates that follow the date the borrower was required to file their return of income for the year. If the borrower has used the estimation method or has another income repayment obligation of $16,000 or more, then the due dates are the provisional tax due dates for 33 the tax year. This is the same system that applies for provisional tax and provides an incentive for borrowers to accurately estimate their repayment obligation. Example Jim has a March balance date, and is required to file his tax return by 7 July 2013. For student loan purposes, Jim has an other income repayment obligation of $800 for the 2012–13 tax year. He will be required to pay his remaining repayment on 28 August 2013, which is his provisional tax date that follows 7 July 2013. Example Mary has business income as a personal trainer. She has a March balance date for tax purposes and has until 31 March 2014 to file her tax return for the 2012–13 tax year under an extension of time arrangement. Mary has an “other income repayment obligation” of $18,000 for that year. However she only paid $12,000 during the year as interim payments and has a remainder payment of $6,000. As Mary’s other income loan repayment obligation was more than $16,000, her remaining repayments of $2,000 are due on each of the interim payment due dates of 28 August 2012, 15 January 2013 and 7 May 2013. As these dates have passed, late payment interest will be charged from these dates. Interim payments Borrowers with an other income repayment obligation for a tax year of $1,000 or more must make interim payments towards the other income loan repayment obligation for the next tax year. The dates these payments are required to be made will be the same dates these borrowers are required to pay their income tax under the provisional tax rules except if a borrower uses the GST ratio method to calculate their provisional tax. In this case the borrower pays their interim payments on 28 August, 15 January and 7 May. There is no change for borrowers with an other income loan repayment obligation for a tax year of less than $1,000. They will not be required to make interim repayments towards the next tax year’s other income loan repayment obligation. Borrowers who are required to make interim payments can calculate them using one of two methods: • either the standard method; or • the estimation method. For borrowers who use the standard method, their previous tax year’s other income loan repayment obligation is uplifted by 5% (or if the borrower has not filed their return of income for the previous year, the other income loan repayment obligation for the tax year immediately preceding the previous tax year is uplifted by 10%). The uplifted amount is divided by the number of interim payments the borrower is required to make to give the payment amount due on each of the interim payment due dates. If a borrower estimates their other income repayment obligation, the interim payments are calculated according to the method described in clause 88(2). 34 Generally the dates that interim payments will be due are the same dates a borrower’s provisional tax would be due. There are exceptions for borrowers who use the GST ratio method for provisional tax or who do not pay provisional tax who will make interim repayments on the three standard dates. 3 For a borrower with a March balance date these would be 28 August, 15 January and 7 May. There are other exceptions if the tax year is a transitional year for the borrower. Borrowers in this category with income sources that may result in a loss will be able to apply for a reduced deduction rate for repayments from any salary and wages they may earn. Background These amendments should make it easier for borrowers with income sources in addition to salary and wages to manage their repayments by aligning the student loan payment dates with provisional tax payment dates. Currently these borrowers have a terminal loan repayment obligation, which is the amount of the repayment obligation outstanding for a tax year after any salary and wage deductions, interim payments and voluntary payments are credited to the repayment obligation for that tax year. The terminal payment is currently due and payable as one amount on the borrower’s terminal tax date for income tax. Allowing certain borrowers, who have a terminal payment of $1,000 or more, to spread that payment over a number of remaining repayment dates alleviates some of the pressure of meeting their obligations on one date. As smaller payments are required over a number of dates, borrowers may be more likely to meet their obligations and avoid getting into debt. In addition, the current under-estimation penalty for those who estimate provides weak incentives for borrowers to estimate correctly and will be removed and replaced with late payment interest from the first interim payment due date. 3 Borrowers who use the GST ratio method to calculate their provisional tax will make three student loan interim payments on the dates specified in columns B, D, and F of the “payments of provisional tax and terminal tax” in schedule 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 that correspond to the borrower’s balance date. 35 36 Interest and alignment of penalties with income tax rules 37 38 OVERSEAS-BASED INTEREST AND LATE PAYMENT INTEREST (Clauses 124 to 135) Summary of proposed amendments Overseas-based borrowers’ loans are subject to interest, which is currently set at 6.6% for the 2010–11 tax year. Loans for New Zealand-based borrowers are interest-free. This reflects the contribution that these borrowers make to New Zealand society. Borrowers who do not pay their repayment obligations by the due date are currently subject to a late payment penalty of 1.5% which compounds monthly and is equivalent to approximately 19.56% per annum. The bill contains amendments to the way interest charges are administered and also replaces the late payment penalty rules with a less punitive late payment interest rate so student loan debt does not become insurmountable. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features The bill introduces the following changes: • StudyLink will cease to charge interest. • Inland Revenue will only charge interest when borrowers are overseas-based. • Overseas-based interest will be charged at the base interest rate, which is currently 6.6%. • The current late payment penalties of approximately 19.56% per annum will be replaced by late payment interest which will be set at the significantly lower rate of 4% above the base interest rate (currently 6.6%) giving a combined rate of 10.6% per annum. • The late payment interest rate will be reduced by 2% if the borrower enters into an instalment arrangement. • Interest will not be charged if the unpaid amount is less than $500. In these cases the unpaid amount will be added back to the loan balance. 39 Detailed analysis Overseas-based interest Currently, interest is charged by StudyLink on loan advances for the period prior to the loan being transferred to Inland Revenue. Once the loan is transferred, Inland Revenue writes off the interest charged by StudyLink. Inland Revenue subsequently charges interest (currently 6.6%) on all loans and writes off that interest for borrowers who meet the interest-free criteria. Under the changes proposed in the bill, StudyLink will no longer charge interest. Instead, interest will only be charged by Inland Revenue for borrowers who are based overseas. Late payment interest Late payment interest will replace the current late payment penalty rules that are applied to student loans. Borrowers who do not meet their loan repayment obligations will be subject to late payment interest on the total unpaid amount at the base interest rate plus a penalty margin of 4% each year. Based on the current base interest rate of 6.6%, this gives a late payment interest rate of 10.6%. The penalty margin will be lowered to 2% for borrowers who enter into instalment arrangements, giving a total interest rate of 8.6%, based on the current base interest rate. This replaces the monthly 1.5% (equivalent to 19.56% a year) late payment penalty which currently applies. As well as creating simpler consequences for non-payment, the replacement of penalties with late payment interest is also intended to reduce the rate at which student loan debt grows which is seen by some as a barrier to keeping up-to-date with current repayment obligations. $500 threshold Clause 129 provides that a borrower is liable to pay late payment interest if the total unpaid amounts are $500 or more. This amount may be changed by regulation. This is a change from the current policy of not charging late payment penalties on individual unpaid amounts less than $334. In addition, the Commissioner may refrain from collection if the unpaid amounts total less than $500. Unpaid amounts in these circumstances will be added back to the loan balance and collected as part of the borrower’s general repayment obligations. Background Borrowers with repayment obligations who fail to pay on time are currently subject to monthly compounding late payment penalties of 1.5%. To facilitate the move to a dedicated loan management system and reduce the extent to which overdue amounts grow due to penalties, late payment penalties will be replaced with an interest charge. 40 PENALTIES AND OFFENCES (Clauses 148 to 159) Summary of proposed amendments The bill contains amendments that will impose penalties for offences relating to the late or non-filing of information by borrowers, and aligns the imposition of both civil and criminal penalties for non-compliant activities with those that apply to other tax offences. The bill also replaces the penal repayment obligation that applies for repayment obligations with a student loan shortfall penalty to align this with the treatment of borrowers who have taken an incorrect tax position. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features The bill introduces the following changes: • late filing penalties will be imposed for incomplete or absent declarations or notifications in certain circumstances; • student loan shortfall penalties will be imposed at the same rate that would apply from taking an incorrect tax position; and • penalties for wilfully or negligently failing to provide information to Inland Revenue will be aligned with those for other tax types. Detailed analysis Late filing penalty Under the proposed changes, a borrower will be liable for a late filing penalty if they do not complete and provide the required declaration of their pre-taxed income as specified in clause 68, or notify Inland Revenue of their world-wide income as specified in clause 106, and the Commissioner has previously notified the borrower that the penalty will be imposed if they do not provide the declaration or notification. The late filing penalty imposed will be the same amount that applies for income tax purposes, depending on the borrower’s income. For example, the penalty imposed will be $50 if the borrower’s income is less than $100,000, $250 if the borrower’s income is between $100,000 and $1,000,000, and $500 if their income is over $1,000,000. The borrower will not be liable for a late filing penalty if he or she has other income and a late filing penalty has been imposed under the Tax Administration Act for the same declaration or notification. 41 Student loan shortfall penalties (clauses 150 to 154) The current penalty that applies to cases of evasion of assessment or payment of a repayment obligation will be replaced with a new student loan shortfall penalty. The student loan shortfall penalty will apply when a borrower: • has taken an incorrect tax position which is lower than the correct tax position; and • is also liable to pay a shortfall penalty for income tax. Borrowers may also be liable to pay a student loan shortfall penalty if taking an incorrect tax position has also reduced their student loan repayment obligation. The student loan shortfall penalty can be up to 150% of the shortfall in the borrower’s repayment obligation, and will be the same percentage rate imposed for the borrower’s income tax shortfall. This will ensure that borrowers who do not comply are penalised on the whole shortfall, and not just the income tax amount. Criminal offences (clauses 155 to 159) Criminal offences currently in the Student Loan Scheme Act relate to wilfully or negligently failing to provide correct information. These offences will be replaced with the criminal offences that apply for tax purposes, such as strict liability offences, and knowledge and evasion offences. The same maximum penalty amounts that apply for income tax offences will also apply to student loan offences. The current offences for aiding and abetting an offence will be retained, but with higher penalty amounts to reflect those imposed in relation to tax, as will the offence relating to prejudicing employees because of their student loan liability. However, there will be no change to the penalty amount for the latter offence and the $2,000 penalty will continue to apply. Background The bill will bring penalties for not complying with filing, information provision, and repayment obligations more into line with those for taxes generally. These changes are intended to: • encourage borrowers to pay the correct interim instalments when due; • bring the rules up-to-date with changes to equivalent tax obligations (for example, higher penalties for evasion and the introduction of a late payment penalty); and • reduce any tendency for borrowers to give student loan obligations a lower priority than tax repayment obligations. 42 Miscellaneous amendments 43 44 MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS Exemptions from the requirement to be present in New Zealand (Clauses 16 to 22 and schedule 1) There are currently a number of exemptions from the requirement that borrowers must be present in New Zealand for at least 183 days to qualify for an interest-free loan. The policy intent of the exemptions was that borrowers should not lose their status as New Zealand-based borrowers for the time that they meet the conditions of an exemption. An error in the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 means that a borrower is given interest- free treatment from the first day they meet the conditions of an exemption, rather than allowing that time to contribute towards satisfying the 183-day requirement. Clauses 16 to 22 and schedule 1 correct this error and treat borrowers who meet the conditions for the exemption as though they are present in New Zealand for that time. The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012. Repayment obligations for overseas-based borrowers (Clauses 97 to 105, and 107 to 109) The existing repayment obligation rules for overseas-based borrowers mainly remain the same under the proposed legislation, with the exception of when a borrower has a repayment obligation that is limited to the loan balance. Borrowers who currently have their repayment obligation limited to their loan balance continue to have interest charged on their outstanding loan balance and as these borrowers do not meet the interest-free criteria they will have a small loan balance left at the end of the tax year equivalent to the interest charged for that year. This results in the borrower having a small residual repayment obligation for the next year. The bill addresses this problem by including the interest charges which will be payable for the year in the overseas- based repayment obligation for these borrowers. Example A borrower has a loan balance of $900, which means currently the borrower has a repayment obligation of $900 due in two instalments on 30 September and 31 March. The borrower makes a payment on each instalment due date of $450 which meets their repayment obligation for that tax year. However, the borrower has been charged approx $45 in interest for the year. This will leave the borrower with a small loan balance for the next year of $45, which will have to be paid in two instalments to meet the next year’s repayment obligation. This will continue until the borrower’s loan balance is less than $20 and the loan balance can be written off under the small balance write-off provisions. Under the proposed amendments, the $45 interest will be included in the repayment obligation for the first year and at the end of that year there will be no residual loan balance and no further repayment obligation for the next year. The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012. 45 Payment priorities (Clauses 186 to 189) The current student loan scheme legislation has limited detail on how payments should be allocated to a borrower’s repayment obligation and loan balance. It simply refers to payments being credited first against any interest charged, and secondly against the principal outstanding. The bill expands on these provisions to provide greater detail and certainty for borrowers about how and when their payments and deductions will meet their repayment obligations and debt or unpaid amounts and how those payments and deductions will reduce the various parts of a borrower’s total loan balance. Clause 187 will require that payments and extra deductions (except standard salary or wage deductions, and payments or extra deductions identified to pay debt or unpaid amounts) will satisfy the following obligations in due date order: • remaining repayments; • interim payments; • overseas-based borrower repayment obligations; • late filing penalties; • student loan shortfall penalties; and • amounts specially assessment by the Commissioner. However, the date order rule does not apply when the due date for payment of an obligation has passed. Also when two payments are made on the same date and one of those payments is an interim payment, the interim payment will be satisfied last. Clause 188 requires that all payments and salary and wage deductions that are not identified to pay debt/unpaid amounts, will be first off-set against any overseas-based interest that has been charged, and secondly, the loan balance. However, the amount off-set must not exceed the borrower’s total obligations for that tax year. Any amount that exceeds the total obligations for that tax year will be first off-set against any late payment interest charged, and secondly, any unpaid amounts, thirdly any remaining overseas-based interest, and then against the loan balance. Clause 189 requires that payments and salary or wage deductions (such as extra deductions) that are identified as intended to pay debt or unpaid amounts, will be off-set first against any late payment interest charged, and secondly, any unpaid amounts. Any part of an identified payment that exceeds the late payment interest charged and the unpaid amount will be off-set against any overseas-based interest that has been charged and then against the loan balance. The amendments will apply for the 2012 tax year, and subsequent tax years. 46 Excess repayments (Clauses 110 to 123) Payments and deductions in excess of a borrower’s repayment obligation for a tax year will generally form part of a borrower’s excess repayment. “Excess repayment” is defined in clause 111 as is a salary or wage deduction or a payment received by the Commissioner in a tax year from a borrower that is in excess of the borrower’s repayment obligations for the tax year and any amount that is due and payable for a prior tax year. However, for the majority of borrowers, salary or wage deductions will only be considered an excess repayment if they are considered to be a significant over- deduction, according to the threshold set by the Commissioner. Over-deductions that are below the Commissioner-set threshold will not be considered as an excess repayment. If a borrower makes payments in excess of their repayment obligations for the current or prior tax years, the Commissioner must as soon as practicable, notify the borrower. The borrower can then put the excess repayment towards the consolidated loan balance (and may qualify for the 10% repayment bonus), elect to receive a refund, or credit the excess to a future repayment obligation. 10% excess repayment bonus Currently, when a borrower has an excess repayment of $500 or more they will be entitled to a 10% bonus which reduces the borrower’s consolidated loan balance, provided they don’t elect for the excess repayment to be refunded or credited to a future repayment obligation. The major change to this policy in the bill is to exclude the 10% excess repayment bonus from minor over-deductions that occur through the PAYE system. This change is required to enable PAYE deductions to satisfy borrower’s repayment obligations on a pay-period basis. Any over-deductions that are determined as significant over- deductions (as determined by the Commisioner in clauses 57 and 60) will be eligible for the 10% bonus, provided the other criteria for the bonus are met. In addition, operational changes will mean that borrowers who wish to have additional amounts deducted from their salary or wages through the PAYE system and put towards an excess repayment for the purposes of the bonus can do so. Employers and PAYE intermediaries will be required to identify or “tag” these payments as separate from standard salary or wage deductions when providing this information to the Commissioner, through the Employer Monthly Schedule. This will allow the current practice to continue, where some borrowers have their employer deduct additional amounts from their salary and wages. The changes will apply from 1 April 2012. 47 Instalment arrangements (Clauses 146 and 147) The bill contains amendments to allow borrowers to apply to enter into an instalment arrangement to pay any late payment interest and the unpaid amount over a period of time. If an instalment arrangement is granted by the Commissioner, the late payment interest rate charged on the unpaid amount is reduced by 2%. Non-compliance with an instalment arrangement will result in the instalment arrangement being cancelled and the late payment interest rate restored to the full rate. The changes will apply from 1 April 2012. Interactions with loan contracts and disclosure requirements (Clauses 214 and schedule 7) The migration of current borrowers to the electronic environment is key to the new student loan repayment management system, and to Inland Revenue’s ability to offer improved services to borrowers. While Inland Revenue will take reasonable steps to inform all borrowers of the changes, obtaining consent from all borrowers for electronic disclosure is not feasible. The bill will also provide a set of comprehensive rules that govern how student loans are repaid and the process for making disclosures to borrowers. These protections are similar to those provided by the current consumer credit legislation.. The bill contains amendments to exempt student loan contracts from the requirements of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 and the Credit Contracts Act 1981. This will ensure that information can be communicated in an electronic form without the consent of a person as long as the person for whom the communication is intended is directly alerted to it in some manner. . The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012. 48 Establishment and administration fees – Budget 2010 changes to the student loan scheme (Clauses 8 and 181) The bill makes several changes to the student loan administration fee structure. The current administration fee imposed by StudyLink will be renamed the “student loan establishment fee”, and a new annual Inland Revenue administration fee will be introduced. In addition, as part of Budget 2010, the student loan establishment fee will be increased from $50 to $60 for all loan accounts established for study beginning on or after 1 January 2011. Until 31 March 2012 this fee will be imposed by contract. From 1 April 2012, it will have statutory authority as provided in this bill. The new annual Inland Revenue fee will apply from 1 April 2011, with the first charge to borrowers being on 31 March 2012. The Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 will specify the amount of the establishment fee and the administration fee. Any future changes to these amounts will be made by regulations. In addition, the bill proposes that a student loan contact is not considered a loan contract under the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 or the Credit Contracts Act 1981. Transitional provisions (Schedules 5 and 6) Schedules 5 and 6 provide for the transition from the existing Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 to the new Act. These provisions generally provide that the 1992 Act continues for the proper administration and completion of all matters relating to the 31 March 2012 tax year and prior years. The new Act will apply to the administration and completion of matters relating to tax years from 1 April 2012 onwards. However, for loan advances made on or after 1 January 2012, the new Act and other provisions related to loan transfers will come into force from 1 January 2012. This date is the start of the academic year and will provide a smooth transition for borrowers from the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 to the new Act. 49 Comparative table of old and the new sections Section reference current Act Clause reference in Bill 1 1 2 4 2(2) 17 2(3) 18 2A 6 3 7 Part 1: Transfer of loan balances to Commissioner for collection 4 14 5 15 6 160 7 161 8 162 9 163 10 164 11 165 12 14(2) 13(1) 13 13(2) 25 Part 2: Collection of repayments from New Zealand-based borrowers 14(1) Part 2, subparts 1 to 3 14(2) 107(b) 14(3) 183(1) & (2) 14A 106 15 46 & 47, 70, 82 16 196 17 28 17B 29 18 30 19(1) 31 & 33 19(2) 32(2) 19(3) 65 20 32 20A(1) to (2) 43 20A(3) 44 50 20A(4) 45 20A(5) 44(2) 20A(6) 44(1)(b) 20A(7) 44(3) 21 39 to 42, 93 to 96, and 140 to 142 22 56 23 34 24 55 25 64 & schedule 2 26 to 30 71 to 79, 82 to 91 and schedules 3 & 4 Part 3: Collection of repayments from overseas-based borrowers 31 98 32 99 32A - repealed in Act N/A 32B - repealed in Act N/A 33 100 34 102 35 103 36 104 36A 107 36B 101 Part 4: Miscellaneous provisions applying to the student loan scheme 37 23 38 24 38AA 125 & 126 38AB 17 38AC 18 38AD 19 38AE(1) to (7A) & (9) 20 38AE(8) 21 38AEA to 38AJA Schedule 1 38AJ(1) 20(1) 38AJ(2)(a) to (b) 21(b) and schedule 1 clause 7(1) 38AJ(2)(c) 21(c) 38AJ(2)(d) 106 38AJ(3) 22 38AJ(4) Schedule 1 clauses 1 and 7(2) 51 38AJA(1) 20(1) 38AJA(2) Schedule 1 clause 8(1) 38AJA(3) Schedule 1 clause 9(a) 38AJA(4)(a)(i) 21(b) & schedule 1 clause 8(1)(b) 38AJA(4)(a)(ii) 21(b) & schedule 1 clause 9(b) 38AJA(4)(b) 21(c) 38AJA(4)(c) 106 38AJA(5) 22 38AJA(6) Schedule 1 Clauses 1 and 8(2) 38AJA(7) 20(4) 38AK 125 & 126 38AL 17 38AM 128 38A – repealed in Act N/A 38B – repealed in Act N/A 38C – repealed in Act N/A 38D – repealed in Act N/A 39 – repealed in Act N/A 40 – repealed in Act N/A 41 – repealed in Act N/A 42(1) 134 42(2) to (4) N/A 42(4) N/A 43(1) 127 43(2) to (4) 135 44(1) 129(1) 44(2) 129(2) & 131 44(3) 4 Definitions of "outstanding obligation" and "unpaid amount" 44A N/A 44B N/A 45 132 & 133 45A 110 45B 111 45C 115 45D 116 45E 117 45F 118 & 119 52 45G 120 45H 121 45I N/A 46 185 47 184 48 & 49 186 50 187, 188 & 189 51(1)(a) 122 51(1)(b) N/A 51(2) to (5) & 51A 136 52 129(1) 53 138 54, 55, 55A, 55B 139 55C 143 55D(1) 144 55D(2) & (3) 145 56 to 57 110 to 113, & 123 57A to 57D N/A 58 114 58A 112 59 194 60 191 60A 190 61 182 62 200 62A 201 62B 202 63 197 63A 198 Part 5: Challenges after transfer of loan balance to Commissioner 64 174 65 175(1) 65A 170 66 175(2) 66A – repealed in Act N/A 66B 176 67 172 53 68 178 69 179 69A(1) 167 69A(2) N/A 69B 175 70 – repealed in Act N/A 71 – repealed in Act N/A 72 – repealed in Act N/A 73 – repealed in Act N/A 74 – repealed in Act N/A 75 – repealed in Act N/A 76 – repealed in Act N/A Part 6: Offences and penalties 77 to 79 155 80 – repealed in Act N/A 81 156 82 157 83 158 84 159 85 150 to 154 86 – repealed in Act N/A Part 7: Regulations and miscellaneous matters 87 208 88 Schedule 6 Clause 2 Part 8: 2007–08 transitional provisions for fresh start for certain borrowers 89 to 105 N/A Part 9: Other transitional provisions 106 to 111 N/A 112 N/A
