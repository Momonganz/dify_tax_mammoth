Te tāke hokohoko me te hoko atu, te panoni i te whakamahinga rānei o tētahi whare rēti GST and selling or changing the use of a rental property
===============================================================================================================================================

You must return GST [output tax](/api/glossary/item?id={EBCE9124-4883-4F9E-BFE0-43211475BA80})
 when you either:

*   sell your residential rental property
*   change its use from GST taxable to non-taxable (exempt). 

An example of change of use would be when you go from renting out [short-stay accommodation](/api/glossary/item?id={362ACC2B-2932-4683-92E8-9A537F6C9A2E})
 to long-term renting. Short stay renting is GST taxable but there's no GST to pay when you rent out long-term.

If you’ve:

*   sold your residential rental property, you need to return GST output tax on the sale price
*   stopped short-term renting, you need to return GST output tax on the market value of the property
*   bought your property with the intention of selling it, then decide to rent it out long-term, you may need to pay back any GST you’ve claimed.

Sometimes you may not have got a full GST claim for a property you buy ([input tax](/api/glossary/item?id={ED8C7235-A822-4F5D-B2EA-0422F7E43E09})
). There are rules that allow an additional adjustment for the unclaimed part of the purchase.

Example: Ahurewa buys a residential property for short-term renting

Ahurewa buys a property to use for short-term renting.

Because short-term renting is a taxable activity, she registers for GST.

Ahurewa must return GST on the short-term rental income received in each GST return. She can also claim GST on the expenses used, or available for use, whilst providing her short-term rental accommodation.

When Ahurewa sells the property she must also return GST on the sale price.

Garfield changes the use of his residential property

Garfield is a GST-registered property developer. He buys a residential property for his property development business.

After developing the property, he decides to rent it out long-term rather than sell it.

Garfield has changed the use from 100% taxable to 100% non-taxable. 

Because the property is no longer being used for making taxable supplies (ie he’s not trying to sell the property anymore), Garfield will need to make a GST change-in-use adjustment. He’ll need to do this in the GST period following the change of use. 

Peter makes a change-in-use adjustment for his yacht

In October 2012, Peter acquires a luxury boat for $800,000 plus GST. On acquisition, he estimated that the boat would be used 100% for charters (a taxable activity). As a result, full input tax credit is claimed.

For the second adjustment period, the boat was only used 80% for taxable activities.

**October 2012** **(boat acquired)**

The percentage of intended use is 100%. The amount of input tax claimed is $120,000, which is $800,000 x 15%.

**March 2013 (end of first adjustment period)**

In the first adjustment period of 6 months, Peter used the boat 100% for charters. As this is the same amount as his intended use, no change-in-use adjustment is required.

**31 March 2014 (end of second adjustment period)**

The second adjustment period lasts for 12 months and ends on 31 March 2014. In this period, Peter used the boat 80% for charters and 20% for personal use (a non-taxable activity). As his use of the boat for taxable activities has changed by more than 10%, Peter must make a change-in-use adjustment.

The percentage of actual use over the 18 months since Peter acquired the boat can be calculated as such:

(100% × 6 months/18 months) + (80% × 12 months/18 months)

33.33 + 53.33 = 86.66%

The percentage of actual use can then be used to calculate the change-in-use adjustment.

(Original intended use percentage - percentage of actual use since acquisition) × original input tax deduction

For Peter, this is:

(100% - 86.66%) × $120,000 = $16,008

In the second adjustment period, Peter must account for $16,008 output tax for the non-taxable use of the boat.
