Corrections
-----------

Product ruling BR Prd  01/17 - correction
-----------------------------------------

Two errors in statutory nomenclature have been identified in BR Prd 01/17. These errors are classified as “minor errors” under section 91 GI of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Commissioner is therefore not required to withdraw the ruling and issue a replacement ruling. The original ruling has been corrected.

In the sixth bullet point of “How the Taxation Laws Apply to the Arrangement”, the words “assessable income” should be read as a reference to “gross income”.

The paragraph, as corrected, reads:

*   Any distribution of category B income to category B unitholders is included within the definition of “beneficiary income” as defined in section OB 1, and is included in the gross income of the unitholder under section HH 3(1).

In the eighth bullet point of “How the Taxation Laws Apply to the Arrangement”, the words “ not assessable” should be read as a reference to “not gross income”.

The paragraph, as corrected, reads:

The amount paid to category B unitholders on the redemption of units is not gross income to the unitholders under section HH 3(5), to the extent that it does not include any “beneficiary income”.
