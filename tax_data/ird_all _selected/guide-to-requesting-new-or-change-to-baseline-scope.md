P 1 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Business Transformation Programme Stage 4 Workstream 1-START Delivery Scope change control process \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Stage 4:Workstream 1 (START Delivery) scope is now baselined. Requests for changes to scope (outcomes) is expected. It is however important that a process is followed to review, assess and approve these changes. Scope Change Control Process \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Stage 4: Workstream 1 (START Delivery) scope is now baselined. Requests for new functions, capability and processes is expected, acceptable and normal practice. The following process has been approved to submit requests for change: 1.Requests for change must be documented and include a preliminary estimate (link to te mplate) 2.The change request must be submitted to the Design Authority for assessment •The person requesting the change, champions the change at the DA •Conditional approval to proceed for Must Do items may be granted 3.The change is then assessed and confirmed by the Delivery Teams in the weekly Delivery Me eting 4.All change is made official via a formal BT programme change request (PCR) 5.Final approval for ALL PCR’s is provided by the DC Transformation •The DC Transformation retains the right veto prior decisions made 6.After DC Approval the Scope Administrator will: •Create an SCP item and link the PCR, •Send out a scope notification to all named parties, and •Add the scope/work to the initiatives register High Level Scope Change Control Process \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Detailed scope change control process WhoWhat Product Owner OR Delegated Scope Change Champion 1.Identify a change to scope, gather information, check if there is a JIRA scope item 2.Requesta Design Authority (DA) agenda item (DA Admin) 3.Preparea one-page scope change summary for the DA which provides: •A brief description of the outcome being targeted •Proposed MoSCoW rating •Business Priority, •Supporting information as available •NB- A “light weight impact assessment” – •This means a high level “T-shirt sized” effort - Dev effort (days) •Supplied / endorsed by the FAST lead and BTM/Product Owner 4.Submit & Present-Product Owner with support from Scope Change “Champion” or Business Architect Design Authority 1.DecideMoSCoW rating •i.e. if we need to proceed from an architectural perspective or not? •Only Must Do items will be able to be given conditional approval to proceed 2.Determineif it needs to escalate the item to the EPPC (TEWC) 3.

Providesa conditional approval to proceed, declinesthe request or suggestsnext steps (Peter Croudace and Patrick O’Doherty are the gatekeepers of this approval) Release Admin•Raise a Change Request (BTPCR) in JIRA for approved changes and attach the scope change summary – leave in “New” status •Raisea Scope Item (SCP) for Must Do approved scope changes or link to existing scope if only a change •PlaceShould Do and Could Do items in the “Optimisation Backlog” for review alongside other demand Wednesday Delivery Meeting (Delivery Leads) •Review and assess scope change requests coming from Design Authority (Delivery Leads) 1.Confirm DA delivery recommendation and revert to DA if DA recommendation is not possible 2.If the item CAN BE absorbed by the Release (based on the T shirt sizing) then DA decision to proceed stands 3.If CANNOT absorbable, then an in-depth impact assessment will be triggered resulting in a full & comprehensive effort estimate, a full BTPCR doc being prepared and all the required consultations being received, prior to submission •Updatethe PCR and once ready progress to “PMO” Review DC Transformation Review and approve or veto the group of PCR's conditionally approved by the DA every fortnight (PMO will support to maintain the current running PCR summary spreadsheet) 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Change Overview and Preliminary Estimate PCR TITLE JIRA BTPCR #<<Update once issued>>ASSIGNEE <<Who’s doing the work compiling the information>> OWNER <<the champion of the change, i.e. who will present the value and motivate its inclusion>> BUSINESS PRIORITY<High, Medium or Low>> DA ASSESSED MOSCOW <<Must, Should, Could have>> CUSTOMER / BUSINESS IMPACT <<High, Medium or Low>> IDEAL DELIVERY DATE / RELEASE <<e.g. 01/04/2020 / S4.1.Other>> SIZE OF CHANGE<<See reference table> DESIGN AUTHORITY REFERENCE <<Design Decision, Action or other DA reference number>> CONSULTED- Listany additionalpeoplethathavebeenconsultedregardingthischange NameComment/ Note EFFORT & IMPACT ESTIMATING – Provide a preliminary high-level estimate and impact to inform the DA’s decision and further approvals required.

This is usually because it is non negotiable (e.g. a legislative change, platform is being decommissioned, or software out of support), there isn’t a workaround, or a workaround isn’t a viable alternative, and the Customer/IR integrity impact of not doing the work is major Should Do and/or Could Do- For Consideration •On the list but needs a Value Assessment •Is aligned to Business Priorities (e .g. data quality,failure-driven demand, peak season flattening, partner efficiency) •Is needed to ensure the Technology strategy is delivered but is is currently unqualified – complete definition and use framework to rank. Should Do: Is in IRs best interest to resolve or deliver. Customer/IR integrity impact: medium-high. Could Do: Delivering the function/item or fixing the issue would either result in an improvement, or make things easier either for IR or IR’s customer. Customer/IR integrity impact: low-minimal Development Effort must include SME effort for Verification Effort is estimated in person days PCR Impact is a measure used in the JIRA change process that combines where relevant the impact across initiative scope, schedule, effort, risk, resources and benefits to provide a high, medium, low classification, a mapping is provided here for reference. 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] When is a PCR Required and what is the difference between a PCR lite and Full PCR? When is A PCR required?: 1.Once Scope has been baselined f or a Release, and the “outcomes” as described in the scope statement are being proposed to be expanded on or reduced –Clarifications which do not have a material impact on the outcomes do not require a PCR 2.Once the “Design Freeze” has been invoked a nd the estimated effort from any of the delivery streams is “Medium” or higher 3.When any stream indicates a dditional funding will be required 4.At the discretion of the Workstream Programme Delivery Manager or the Enterprise Architect 5.A team lead may r equesta PCR is raised for visibility purposes What is the difference between a PCR lite and Full PCR?: •A PCR Lite is on ly used for Workstream 1 and are intended to impose the least possible information gathering burden in order to carry out a pre-liminary assessment of the impact of change •With a PCR Lite not all delivery teams are consulted prior to conditional approval being granted by the Design Authority to proceed with Must Do items •The PCR lite preliminary assessment is brought to the Wednesday Delivery meeting where every team is given t he opportunity to expand the impact and or “push back” on the Design Authority conditional approval. It is at this meeting the decision will be taken on whether a full PCR will be required •Examples of additional attributes which a f ull PCR will hold are: –Full budget impact assessment resulting from the additional funding request –Alternative options for consideration –A description of the impact of doing nothing –Additional detail on the impact assessments –Impacts on Key milestone/s and or scheduled dates
