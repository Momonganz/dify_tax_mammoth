Most people file their GST return in myIR which does the calculations for you. If you file a paper return the form tells you what calculations to make.

Regardless of how you file you need to work out your total:

*   sales and income
*   zero-rated supplies
*   debit adjustments
*   purchases and expenses
*   credit adjustments
