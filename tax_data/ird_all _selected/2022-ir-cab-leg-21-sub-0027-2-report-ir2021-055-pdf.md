This report asks you to consider and authorise the lodgement of the attached draft Cabinet Legislation Committee (“LEG”) paper. The paper seeks approval to submit an Order in Council to the Executive Council, to enable Inland Revenue to implement compulsory direct crediting to taxpayers of refunds of totalisator duty, lottery duty, casino duty, and unclaimed money. Context and Background 2. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister of Revenue has previously agreed to implementing compulsory direct crediting of refunds of totalisator duty, lottery duty, casino duty, and unclaimed money, and for officials to instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office (“PCO”) to draft an Order in Council to give effect to the policy change ( IR2021/017 refers). 3. The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for the progressive implementation, through Orders in Council, of compulsory direct crediting for the tax types that Inland Revenue administers. Progressive implementation ensures Inland Revenue has the necessary flexibility to prepare its systems before direct crediting is implemented. It also gives taxpayers more time to provide Inland Revenue with up- to-date bank account details and (for taxpayers with complex business activities) to plan and adapt their processes. The intent is that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will eventually be required to direct credit all refunds into taxpayers’ bank accounts. 4. PCO have drafted the Tax Administration (Direct Credit of Totalisator Duty, Lottery Duty, Casino Duty, and Unclaimed Money) Order 2021 (“the Order in Council”). Officials have prepared a draft LEG paper for your consideration and (if you agree) for lodgement with the Cabinet Office by 11 March 2021 and for consideration at the LEG meeting of 18 March 2021. Implementation 5. As with other tax types such as donation tax credits, goods and services tax, and student loan deductions where refunds are required to be direct credited, an exemption will be available for taxpayers who would experience undue hardship or for circumstances where it is impracticable to refund through direct credit. An example of this is where a taxpayer does not have a New Zealand bank account, so Inland Revenue cannot direct credit any tax refunds to the taxpayer. 6. The proposed changes will have no fiscal impact. Any administrative costs of implementing the proposed change will be accommodated within existing Business Transformation programme funding. In Confidence IR2021/055: Direct crediting of refunds: Cabinet Legislation Committee paper Page 2 of 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Consultation 7. The Treasury and the PCO have been informed of the contents of this report. Next steps 8. If you agree, the PCO would provide the Cabinet Office with the Order in Council. 9.

Our intention is that LEG paper be considered at the LEG meeting of 18 March 2021 and apply to refunds of these tax types 28 days after the gazetting of the Order. We have attached speaking notes for your use at LEG. 11.
