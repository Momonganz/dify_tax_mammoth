The term "IR56 taxpayer" is used to identify workers who are required to pay their own taxes (PAYE) on their wage or salary, but are not self-employed. Here are the examples of workers who might be classed as IR56 taxpayers: • • embassy staff • • New Zealand-based representatives of overseas companies • • United States Antarctic Program workers • • private domestic workers who work part-time, such as home-helpers, caregivers, nannies, gardeners and domestic odd-jobbers. Private domestic workers are people who: • • work in someone else's home, and • • do work for their employer that is not related to the employer's business, and • • are paid directly by their employer, and • • don't regularly work full-time, eg, work no more than 30 hours a week on average for each employer. IR56 taxpayers aren't self-employed. If you work for an employer part-time as a private domestic worker, you're an IR56 taxpayer. If you regularly work full-time, your employer becomes responsible for your PAYE tax and other deductions, such as student loan, child support and KiwiSaver (if any). Here are some examples to help you decide if you are an IR56 taxpayer. Megan is employed to clean Amy's house for eight hours a day, every Monday to Friday. Because Megan works for Amy for more than 30 hours a week, Amy must register as an employer and account for Megan's PAYE. Example 1 Liz cleans houses for five different people. She averages around eight hours a week for each person. Although she works a total of more than 30 hours, she is an IR56 taxpayer. She fits the definition of a private domestic worker because she isn't working full-time for any one employer – she works in the employers' homes and is paid direct by each employer. This means Liz is responsible for paying the PAYE on her income from her domestic work. Example 2 IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 6 Doug works for Jessica as a gardener at her home. He works on a regular basis for up to four hours a week and is paid direct by Jessica. This makes Doug an IR56 taxpayer because he fits the definition of a private domestic worker. Doug is responsible for paying the PAYE on his income from Jessica. Example 3 Joy runs a childcare service in her own home for seven children from 7 am to 6 pm on weekdays. She employs other staff and the parents of each child pay Joy for her service. Joy is self-employed. She's not an IR56 taxpayer because she doesn't fit the definition of a private domestic worker. Joy is responsible for her own tax affairs, such as paying income tax and GST. Joy's staff are her employees, so they aren't IR56 taxpayers either. Joy must register as an employer and account for her employees' PAYE. Example 4 If you provide an ACC client with any of the following services: •• attendant care •• childcare •• home help •• attendant care services related to training for independence and if you're paid direct by the ACC client or ACC, you're not an IR56 taxpayer. ACC deducts the tax from these payments before they're made. Note For more help Because it's not always clear whether you're an employee or self-employed, read our leaflet Self-employed or an employee? - IR336 to help work out your employment status. ird.govt.nz 7 New IR56 taxpayers What you need to do If you're an IR56 taxpayer, you need to: • • have an IRD number • • register as an IR56 taxpayer. Applying for an IRD number If you don't already have an IRD number, you need to fill in an IRD number application - resident individual - IR595 form. For more information on applying for an IRD number go to ird.govt.nz/IRDnumber Registering as an IR56 taxpayer To register as an IR56 taxpayer you can apply online at ird.govt.nz/ir56 or you can call us on 0800 377 772. What happens next? 1 Complete your IR330 The IR330 is your tax code declaration. It's your record of the tax code you'll use. You need to work out which tax code applies to you. See page 9 for help working out your tax code. 2 Keep records You need to keep records of all your income. See page 13 for record keeping requirements. 3 Calculate PAYE You need to work out how much tax (PAYE) to deduct from your IR56 income - see page 16. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 8 4 Send in your New employee details - IR346 form You’ll need to fill out a New employee details - IR346 form and send it to us either: • • before your first pay day; or • • with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes your first pay. 5 Send in your Employment information - IR348 form At the end of every month you must complete an Employment information - IR348 form, which has details of your gross wages and deductions made. You must file your IR348 within ten working days after the end of the month. If you don’t receive income as an IR56 taxpayer in any month, you don’t need to file a return. 6 Pay your Tax You must pay your PAYE and other deductions to us by the 20th of the following month. If we don't receive both your IR348 and your payments by the due dates, penalties and interest may apply - see page 25. Note ird.govt.nz 9 Selecting your tax code Once you've got a copy of the Tax code declaration - IR330 form, you need to fill in your personal details and choose a tax code. Working out your tax code If your IR56 income is your main or only source of income Follow the instructions on the IR330 and select the appropriate tax code. It should be either M, ME, M SL or ME SL. Some earners will be entitled to the independent earner tax credit (IETC). If this applies to you, your tax code will be ME or ME SL if you have a student loan. To find out if you should be using this tax code see page 20. If your IR56 income is a secondary income There are three options for deducting your tax in this case. Standard option Normally, you use a secondary tax code (SB, S, SH, ST, SB SL, S SL, SH SL or ST SL) for secondary employment. However, if you expect to earn over $14,000 a year from all income sources, you may end up paying too much tax during the year. If the secondary code you choose is SB SL or S SL and your gross income from your main job is less than the pay period threshold, eg, $374 per week, the standard student loan deductions for your secondary job may be too high. Go to ird.govt.nz/special-deduction-rate to find out how you can get a lower rate for these deductions. Note Self-calculating option An alternative to using a secondary tax code is to use the self-calculating method. This lets you work out how much tax you should pay on your IR56 income. If you choose this option show "STC" as your tax code on your IR330. The self-calculating method takes into account the income and PAYE deducted from your main source of income, ie, salary, wages or benefit. Using this method will help you pay a more accurate amount of tax in some situations. For help completing the IR56 summary forms using the self- calculating method see page 13. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 10 Tailored tax code option Another alternative is to apply for a tailored tax code. For more information read our leaflet Do you need a tailored tax code - IR23G, go to our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides or call us on 0800 377 774. Self-calculating - using the IR56 summary form If you receive IR56 income and salary or wages or a benefit, the self-calculating method is a better way of calculating the tax you need to pay. PAYE to pay using the self-calculating method is $85.59.

self-calculating and secondary tax code options Based on the examples on the previous pages, by using the self-calculating method, you'd pay $85.59 less than you would if you used an S tax code, but almost the same amount as if you used the SB tax code. Option Tax to pay Self-calculating method $85.59 Secondary code $136.00 Difference $50.41 Self-calculating method $85.59 SB code (use only if your expected income from all sources will be less than $14,000 a year) $85.60 Difference $0.01 Completing the Tax code declaration - IR330 When you've worked out which tax code to use, you need to complete an IR330 tax code declaration form. You don't need to fill in a new IR330 each year, but you do need to complete a new one if you want to change your tax code. You can then apply the new code from the start of the pay period that you made the change. Keep your IR330 as part of your tax records - don't send it to us. ird.govt.nz 13 Record keeping and completing your IR56 summary forms You must keep all records for seven years. They must be in English, unless you have written approval from us to use another language for your records. Self-calculation records - IR56 summary form If you have more than one source of income, we suggest you keep a weekly record of all your earnings. Use the IR56 summaries at the back of this guide to help complete your Employment information - IR348 and to correctly calculate your PAYE. Remember: • • keep your own weekly records of all your income • • every payday, add the totals for the pay period and write this on your IR56 summary form - see pages 29-40 for blank forms to fill in. Keep the IR56 summary form as well as a copy of your New employee details - IR346 form and copies of your Employment information - IR348 forms. Main income records If your IR56 income is your only income, at the end of each month add up your income and put it on your Employment information - IR348. You need to keep a record of your earnings, such as payslips, diary or bank statements if your wage is direct credited, or a wage summary. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 14 Completing your IR56 summary forms The IR56 summary form is used for self-calculating the tax you need to pay. Payer's name This is the name of the person who is paying you. If you work for more than one person, fill in the names of all the payers. Box A - Total IR56 earnings Add up the income from your IR56 earnings to get your total gross IR56 income. Box B - Total earnings from salary or wages Add up the income that has PAYE deducted to get your total gross salary or wages. Box C - PAYE on salary or wages Add up the PAYE deducted from your salary, wages or benefit to get your total PAYE deducted. Box D - Total gross earnings Add Box A to Box B. This is your total combined gross earnings liable for tax for the month. Box E - PAYE Go to the monthly PAYE tables to work out the PAYE on the amount in Box D using the tax code you selected (M or ME), or you can use our calculator under the "Calculators and tools" section of our website. Write the PAYE in Box E. Box F - Total PAYE paid Copy the Box C amount here. Box G - PAYE to pay Subtract Box F from Box E. Write the answer in Box G. This is the amount of PAYE you must pay us. If you receive a benefit you may need to contact Work and Income to get details of your gross benefit income and PAYE. Note ird.govt.nz 15 Example - IR56 summary form April 2020 Earnings as an IR56 taxpayer with NO PAYE deducted Payer's name Gross earning (with no PAYE deducted) Transfer to "gross earnings and/or schedular payments" box on your Employment information - IR348 form. Total gross A Earnings with PAYE deducted (salary and wages) Payer's name Gross earning (before PAYE deducted) PAYE deducted by employer BC Total grossTotal PAYE Total combined gross earnings Add Box A and B D PAYE (from PAYE tables) on combined total gross earnings in Box D E Total PAYE paid from Box C F PAYE to pay Subtract Box F from Box E. This is your balance of PAYE to pay. G Transfer to Box 3 on your Employment information - IR348 form. Keep the IR56 summary for your records - don't send the form to us. Note IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 16 Calculating your PAYE PAYE tables PAYE tables are updated each year, or when the tax rate changes. You can view the PAYE tables or use the PAYE calculator at ird.govt.nz or you can order a copy by calling 0800 257 773 (remember to have your IRD number with you). Main tax codes The first section of the PAYE tables has columns for M and ME codes. Use these columns if you have shown M or ME (or STC for self-calculation method) as your tax code on your IR330. Remember if you used STC on your IR330 because you're using the self-calculating method, you need to use the M or ME column in the tax tables to calculate your tax. Student loans If you have a student loan you must use the "SL Loan ded" column that corresponds to your tax code to calculate your repayment amount. Remember that your tax code must be one of the following: • • M SL, ME SL, SB SL, S SL, SH SL or ST SL if you have a student loan.

Inland Revenue collects this levy on behalf of ACC. The earners' levy is already included in the PAYE amounts, so you don't have to do any extra calculations. ACC will invoice you as an employer for the levies that are payable on your IR56 income (eg, levies to cover you for work-related injuries). If you also receive other income liable for ACC levies like schedular payments, active partnership income or self-employed income, we'll pass this information to ACC to invoice levies on this income. Further information If you have any queries about ACC or levies payable, please see ACC's website www.acc.co.nz/about-us or contact the ACC Business Service Centre by: phone 0800 222 776 email business@acc.co.nz Independent earner tax credit (IETC) IETC is a tax credit for individual New Zealand tax residents with annual net income\* between $24,000 and $48,000, who meet the following criteria: • • neither you nor your partner are entitled to Working for Families Tax Credits • • neither you nor your partner receive any overseas equivalent of Working for Families Tax Credits • • you're not receiving an income-tested benefit, NZ Super, Veteran's Pension or an overseas equivalent. Entitlement is determined monthly, so if you don't meet the criteria for any part of a month you won't qualify for any of that month. If you qualify for IETC, and your IR56 income is your main source of income, deduct PAYE using the ME tax code. Or, complete a Tax code declaration - IR330 and give it to the employer you earn the highest income from. The tax codes are: • • ME for non-student loan borrowers who qualify, and • • ME SL for student loan borrowers who qualify. For more information on IETC go to ird.govt.nz/ietc \* Net income means your total income from all sources less any allowable deductions or current year losses (not including any losses brought forward). If you're not sure whether you qualify for the IETC you can continue to use the same tax code. At the end of the year, we’ll send you an income tax assessment and let you know if you have an IETC entitlement. ird.govt.nz 21 KiwiSaver IR56 taxpayers fall into two groups for KiwiSaver. 1. Private domestic workers, ie home help, nannies, attendant caregivers, gardeners and domestic odd-jobbers. 2. Embassy staff, New Zealand based representatives of overseas companies and United States Antarctic Program workers. Private domestic workers • • can only opt in to KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider (if you meet the eligibility rules) • • can’t opt out of KiwiSaver - contact your scheme provider to negotiate a break in contributions • • can deduct KiwiSaver contributions from your salary or wages • • can choose to make compulsory employer contributions. • • must include KiwiSaver amounts on the IR348 along with their PAYE. Private domestic workers are not liable for ESCT (employer superannuation contribution tax) on any employer contributions. If you make employer contributions include the gross amount at box 7 of your Employment information - IR348. Note Staff employed by foreign embassies, New Zealand-based representatives of overseas companies, and United States Antarctic Program workers • • can only opt in to KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider (if you meet the eligibility rules) • • can’t opt out of KiwiSaver - contact your scheme provider to negotiate a break in contributions • • can deduct contributions from your salary and wages • • are not entitled to receive compulsory employer contributions • • include KiwiSaver deductions on the IR348 along with their PAYE. Any KiwiSaver member can make voluntary contributions at any time, by making payments directly to their provider, or through Inland Revenue. These will not offset any obligation you have to make contribution deductions from your salary or wages. Voluntary contributions paid through Inland Revenue are not recorded on your employer returns. Note For more information about KiwiSaver, go to kiwisaver.govt.nz or KiwiSaver for employers - KS4 or the Employers Guide - IR335. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 22 Payroll giving Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme. It's a way of making donations from salary or wages to approved donee organisations and receiving an immediate tax credit for payroll donations of 33 ¹ / ₃ cents for each dollar donated. Private domestic workers who file their Employment information - IR348 form electronically can choose to take part in payroll giving. If you choose to donate through payroll giving you'll be responsible for: • • ensuring your chosen donee organisation is on the IRD approved donee organisation list at ird.govt.nz/donee • • deducting donations from your pay and passing the donation to the donee organisation • • advising the donee organisation that the donation is made through payroll giving • • calculating the tax credit you're entitled to and including this on your Employment information - IR348 • • reducing the amount of PAYE by the amount of the tax credits for payroll donations for that pay period. If you want to take part in payroll giving you'll need to complete your employment information electronically. Go to ird.govt.nz to register and watch the demonstration. For more information about taking part in payroll giving, refer to our Payroll giving - IR617 guide or ird.govt.nz/ir56 If you choose to donate through payroll giving, you won't be able to claim the same donation on the Tax credit claim form - IR526 as you've already received the credit. Note ird.govt.nz 23 Electronic filing If you have access to the internet you can complete and file your IR348 online. With myIR you can access a range of online services when and where you want. You’ll need to register for a myIR secure online services account - go to ird.govt.nz/myIR to register. To find out more about online filing you can attend one of our employer workshops/seminars being run throughout the country - ird.govt.nz/contact-us When to make payments You must pay PAYE monthly. PAYE deducted in one month is due by the 20th of the following month. Pay periodDue date Theresa worked for five days and was paid in October20 November Theresa worked for the whole of November and was paid on 1 December20 January. Example If your payment is made late, you'll be charged interest and may also be charged late payment penalties and non-payment penalties - see page 25. IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 24 How to make payments For full details on payment options go to ird.govt.nz/pay Paying online by credit or debit card You can make all your online payments by credit or debit card. There is a 1.42% convenience fee on each transaction. You won't have to pay this fee if you're making overseas payments for a student loan or non-custodial child support. Electronically through your bank Electronic payments are automatic payment, direct credit and online banking. Major banks offer an online tax payment service on their website which ensures the payment reference details are included with your payment. If your bank does not offer this service, you can pay using their standard online service. Make sure you include all the details we need to credit your payment to your account. If you’re paying PAYE, you need to select the DED tax type. DED refers to “employer deductions” and applies to PAYE or any combination of PAYE, child support, student loan, KiwiSaver and ESCT. Example Particulars100100100Your IRD number Payee code0 00TAXDEDPayee code must be 000 space TAX space DED Reference3 0042016 Your return period end date with no spaces or dashes By post If you post us a cheque for payment: • • make your cheque payable to Inland Revenue • • cross it "Not transferable" • • post it with the payment slip • • never send cash. When sending a cheque, write the following on the reverse side: • • your IRD number • • tax type • • the month the payment is for. Example 100-100-100-PAYE-30/04/2016 Note ird.govt.nz 25 Penalties and interest Late filing penalties Late filing penalties apply when an Employment information - IR348 isn't filed by the due date. The penalty for late filing your employment information is $250. If charged, you have 30 days after the end of the month in which you were required to file to pay the penalty. If the late filing penalties aren’t paid within 30 days after the end of the month, you’ll also be charged late payment penalties and interest on the late filing penalties. Late payment penalty and interest We'll charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment, but if you have a good payment history with us we may contact you before we do this. We'll also charge you interest if you don't make your tax payment by the due date. Interest isn't charged or paid on amounts of $100 or less of underpaid or overpaid tax. Non-payment of employment deductions penalty If the PAYE amount owing for the month isn't paid by the due date, we'll send you a reminder letter. If the overdue amount isn't paid or an instalment arrangement entered into, we'll charge you a non-payment penalty (NPP). You’ll still have to pay the late payment penalties and interest. Every month an amount remains outstanding we'll charge you a further NPP. If, within a month of the penalty date you don't pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement, the NPP will be 10% of the unpaid tax. If you do pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement within that month, the NPP will be at a reduced rate of 5% of the unpaid tax. For more information about penalties and interest see our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. Arrangements In some situations where you can't pay your tax by the due date we may agree to arrange a payment plan with you. If you think you are going to have difficulties paying your PAYE, talk to us before it’s overdue as we may be able to reduce the penalties. The longer you leave it the more you’ll have to pay. Failing to account for PAYE You are responsible for deducting your own PAYE and paying this to us. Failing to do so is a serious offence and we would consider charging shortfall penalties or prosecution. There are also penalties for failing to deduct or account for student loan repayments (where applicable). IR56 TAXPAYER’S HANDBOOK INLAND REVENUE 26 End-of-year responsibilities IR56 taxpayers whose only income is from IR56 income, salary or wages, Māori authority distributions, interest or dividends and we are satisfied we have all your income details we will automatically complete your end-of-year income tax assessment and advise you of the result. If you received any other type of income apart from IR56 income, salary or wages (with PAYE deducted), Māori authority distributions, interest or dividends, you must file an IR3 return.
