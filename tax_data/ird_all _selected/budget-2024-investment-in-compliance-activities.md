Budget 2024: investment in compliance activities

Indicators of Performance
-------------------------

The following tables track the performance indicators for the investment in compliance activities.

Inland Revenue has not ring-fenced resourcing for the additional activity, therefore intended results are measured by an uplift in revenue and cash collected from the following activities.
