MEDIA STATEMENT

### Interest-free student loans for overseas charity workers

The government has named the 48 charitable organisations whose volunteers may be exempted from interest on their student loans while working for those organisations overseas.

Borrowers living overseas for more than six months will generally not qualify for the new interest free student loan policy which comes into effect on 1 April," Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"However, the law gives Inland Revenue the discretion to grant an exemption for certain borrowers who are overseas, including post-graduate students, government employees and people who work for free or for a token payment for a charitable organisation operating overseas.

"The regulation signed today specifies the 48 charitable organisations that are covered by the exemption. It will still be up to Inland Revenue to decide if individuals working for those organisations qualify for the full interest write-off under the policy," Dr Cullen said.

The write-off will apply for a maximum of two years.

Charitable organisations not on the list can still apply to Inland Revenue for exemption status.

Under the new policy students who borrow from 1 April will only have to repay what they borrow. Students and graduates with existing loans will not be charged any further interest. The policy only applies to those remaining in New Zealand.
