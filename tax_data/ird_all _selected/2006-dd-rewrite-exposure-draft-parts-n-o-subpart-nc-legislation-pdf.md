Standard method: 5% uplift (2) Under the standard method, the amount of provisional tax payable for the tax year is 105% of the person’s residual income tax for the preceding tax year, determined under section NC 6. Subsection (3) overrides this subsection. Standard method: 10% uplift (3) Despite subsection (2), the amount of provisional tax payable for the tax year is 110% of the person’s residual income tax for the tax year before the preceding tax year if— (a) they are required to provide a return of income for the preceding tax year; and (b) the return is not due on or before the date on which the first payment of provisional tax for the tax year is required through the application of section 37 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, or an extension granted under that section; and (c) they have not provided the return on or before that date; and (d) the date is not the date of instalment F for the corresponding income year.

Commissioner’s determination (7) If the Commissioner determines a person’s provisional tax liability under section 119 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the amount or liability is that last determined by the Commissioner and notified to the person at least 30 days before the instalment date. The 30-day requirement does not apply in a case to which section 119(1)(d) of that Act applies (which relates to an estimate of residual income tax that is not fair and reasonable). Life insurance business (8) A person who carries on a business of providing life insurance and who is liable for income tax under the life insurance rules, must at the time they determine their provisional tax liability provide the Commissioner with details of the calculation of that liability. In particular, they must detail the extent to which the amount of provisional tax relates to the policyholder base.

Assessment for preceding tax year (2) The person’s residual income tax for a tax year is based on their assessment for the preceding tax year unless the Commissioner has sent out a notice of assessment for the tax year at least 30 days before the relevant instalment date, in which case the amount of residual income tax is based on the Commissioner’s assessment for the preceding tax year. Commissioner’s assessment for preceding tax year (3) The person’s residual income tax is based on the Commissioner’s assessment for the preceding tax year, whenever the assessment is made, if— Part N–Tax collection rules Subpart NC–Provisional tax 37 (a) they are required under sections 33 and 37 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to provide a return of income for the preceding tax year but have failed to do so by the relevant instalment date; or (b) they are not required under sections 33 and 37 of that Act to provide a return by the relevant instalment date, and subsections (2) and (4) do not apply. Residual income tax for preceding tax year (4) The amount of provisional tax payable for a tax year is the amount of the person’s residual income tax for the preceding tax year if— (a) they are not required to provide a return of income for the preceding tax year; or (b) their residual income tax for the tax year before the preceding tax year was $2,500 or less, and they were not required to provide, and have not provided, a return of income for the tax year by the date of instalment F for the corresponding income year. Later increased assessment (5) If the Commissioner’s assessment of a person’s income tax liability occurs after the payment date for an instalment of provisional tax and would result in an increase in the person’s residual income tax for the preceding tax year, the residual income tax is treated for the purposes of the provisional tax rules as if it had not been increased. Transitional years and consolidated groups (6) A person’s residual income tax in a transitional year is calculated under section NC 20. For consolidated groups, the calculation is made under section NC 29. Defined in this Act: amount, assessment, Commissioner, consolidated group, corresponding income year, income tax liability, instalment date, notice, provisional tax, residual income tax, return of income, tax year, transitional year Origin: 2004 No 35 s MB 5 NC 7 Estimation method When this section applies (1) This section applies to a person who is liable to pay provisional tax under section NC 5(5) and to the calculation of the amount of their provisional tax payable for a tax year under the estimation method. Fair and reasonable estimate (2) On or before an instalment date, the person may make a fair and reasonable estimate of their residual income tax for the tax year by informing the Part N–Tax collection rules Subpart NC–Provisional tax 38 Commissioner of the estimate. The amount of provisional tax payable for a tax year is the amount of the estimated residual income tax. Revising estimates (3) The person may choose to revise an estimate made under subsection (2) before an instalment date. The amount last estimated is the amount taken into account under section NC 5(5). Reasonable care in making and maintaining assessment (4) A person who makes an estimate under subsection (2) must take reasonable care in making it, and must revise the estimate for the tax year if, at some time in the tax year, the amount estimated is no longer fair and reasonable. Estimation higher than provisional tax payable (5) If a person’s estimate is more than the provisional tax that is payable for the tax year, they are treated as having taken reasonable care in making the estimate. Changing calculation method from GST ratio (6) If, under section NC 18(5), a person changes they way they determine the amount of provisional tax after the date of an instalment, they must estimate their residual income tax for the corresponding income year, and must pay provisional tax on whichever of instalment dates B, D, and F for their income year occur after 30 days from their last ratio instalment date. Disaster relief (7) A person who is significantly affected by a self-assessed adverse event or qualifying event may make an estimate of their provisional tax under section NC 36, and that section overrides this section. Defined in this Act: amount, Commissioner, corresponding income year, GST ratio, instalment date, provisional tax, qualifying event, ratio instalment date, residual income tax, self-assessed adverse event, tax year Origin: 2004 No 35 s MB 6 NC 8 GST ratio method Using GST ratio (1) A person liable to pay provisional tax who meets the requirements of sections NC 16 and is not excluded by section NC 17 may choose to use a GST ratio to determine the amount of provisional tax payable for a tax year. Meaning of GST ratio (2) The person’s GST ratio is the percentage figure that is obtained by dividing their residual income tax for the preceding tax year by their total taxable supplies for the corresponding income year. The amount of residual income tax and the amount of total taxable supplies are called base amounts for the purposes of this section. Part N–Tax collection rules Subpart NC–Provisional tax 39 When amounts based on tax year before preceding tax year (3) If a base amount for the preceding tax year or corresponding income year is not known, the GST ratio is the percentage based on the assessment for the tax year and corresponding income year that are immediately before the preceding tax year and corresponding income year. Commissioner’s calculation (4) The Commissioner must calculate a person’s GST ratio, informing them by— (a) including the percentage figure on the person’s pre-printed GST return form; or (b) advising them in writing or by telephone; or (c) some other means. Adjustment to GST ratio (5) The Commissioner must adjust a person’s GST ratio if a base amount is revised through, among other reasons,— (a) an assessment or an amended assessment of the person’s income tax return for the preceding tax year; or (b) a change in the value of the total taxable supplies for the corresponding income year; or (c) the disposal of an asset to which section NC 19 applies. New GST ratio (6) When subsection (5) applies, the Commissioner must inform the person of the new GST ratio. The new ratio applies in relation to the relevant instalment dates that occur 30 days after the date on which the person is informed. Transitional years (7) If a person has paid instalments of provisional tax in a transitional year, for the tax year that follows the transitional year, for the purposes of this section and section NC 11, they must— (a) ignore the transitional year when determining their residual income tax or total taxable supplies; and (b) base their determination of residual income tax and total taxable supplies on the tax year preceding the transitional year. Total taxable supplies (8) In subsections (2), (5), and (7), and in sections NC 11, NC 19, and NC 31, total taxable supplies, for a person and a period, means the amount that is the total value of taxable supplies by the person for the period. The amount includes the GST charged on the supplies.

If the full amount is not divisible into exactly equal instalments, the final instalment carries the difference. Provisional tax payable in 3 instalments (2) A person pays provisional tax in 3 instalments on the interest instalment dates for the tax year in the months set out in schedule 13, part A, columns B, D, and F (Dates for payment of provisional tax and terminal tax) for the person’s corresponding income year.

Extension of time for return (9) A person who has not provided a return of income for a preceding tax year and whose residual income tax for the tax year before the preceding tax year was Part N–Tax collection rules Subpart NC–Provisional tax 42 $2,500 or less must pay provisional tax for the tax year on the instalment dates set out in section NC 13 or NC 14, as applicable. Transitional years (10) In a transitional year, provisional tax is payable as set out in section NC 21 and schedule 13, part B (Months for payment under sections NC 9 and NC 22 to NC 25).
