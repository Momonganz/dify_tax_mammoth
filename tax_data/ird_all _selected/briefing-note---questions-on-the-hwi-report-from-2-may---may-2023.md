At your meeting with officials on 2 May, you asked for additional information on the following related to the High-Wealth Individuals (HWI) effective tax rate report: • Examples of ways we tax unrealised income; • Analysis of ownership patterns (we will provide this later); • Rate of return information for project population; and • A simple explanation for why unrealised gains are income. 2. We also update you on recent comments by Thomas Piketty on the report. Comments by Thomas Piketty 3. In a podcast broadcast by French radio on 28 April, Thomas Piketty referred to the HWI report during a debate about a French website that discloses where tax revenues are raised and how French taxes are spent. 4. His comments related to the HWI report were: • Transparency is good but the French website lacks details. He noted that in contrast, New Zealand just released a study showing tax distribution across the income and wealth distribution (referring to the Treasury study), and also the 300 wealthiest New Zealand families paid only 8% of their income in tax (note Page 2 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] the actual figure is about 9%), while the average for New Zealanders is about 20%. • According to recent media releases, the wealthiest Americans pay about 4% (we presume he is referring to the Council of Economic Advisors study we cited in our report – that figure was about 8%). • He indicated he believed the equivalent figure for the wealthiest French is probably about the same as for the Americans. He encouraged the French government to do a similar study as our HWI study, using the 300 or 500 wealthiest French. 5. In earlier comments to Radio NZ, he described the New Zealand reports as “depressing but not surprising” and said the obvious solution was a progressive wealth tax at the top. Unrealised income 6. Measuring income on an accrual or unrealised basis is common for many purposes. For example, it is standard for business financial statements to be prepared on an accrual basis, because this is a fairer presentation of income over a period than on a realised or cash-flow basis. 7. The tax system uses a combination of cash-flow and accrual measures. Cash-flow is often used for simplicity and certainty and in many cases there is very little difference between a cash-flow and accrual measure (such as for wages and salaries). 8. Examples where the tax system measures income on an accrual instead of cash- flow basis include: • Financial arrangements (debt instruments) – the financial arrangement rules (income and expense from debt) primarily require an accrual measure of income. For example, loan income or expense must be calculated on a yield-to- maturity basis and/or the change in value of the debt instrument over the year must be included. Some debt instruments may be measured on a cash-flow basis for simplicity when the value is small (such as bank deposits). • Foreign investment funds (FIFs) – FIFs are generally portfolio interests in foreign shares. Under the FIF rules, the primary calculation method is the fair dividend rate, a deemed 5% return regardless of the realised income (such as dividends) from the shares. An alternative measure is comparative-value, which is also an accrual measure (the unrealised gain or loss must be taken into account, although to reduce arbitrage there is a limit to recognising the loss). • Depreciation loss – when durable personal property is used to produce income, an annual deduction is allowed for an accrued depreciation loss. When the property is sold, gain or loss must be recognised so that the total deductions claimed equal the actual loss. Rate of return information 9. You asked for rate of return information. The following tables some high-level indicative returns for total economic income, and only non-taxable economic income: Page 5 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 1.
