Percentage of tax refunds which are accurate
--------------------------------------------

### Income tax refund accuracy

One of our case studies looks at how automatic income tax assessments for individuals are making tax simpler for New Zealanders, by optimising the use of data that we hold. With more detailed and timely reporting of employment and investment income, we expect to see the value of end-of-year income tax refunds reduce over time.

Percentage of social policy payments which are accurate
-------------------------------------------------------

### Working for Families payment accuracy

This indicator looks at whether Working for Families Tax Credit (WfFTC) customers received the amounts they‘re entitled to, to support their families. Our aim is to improve the accuracy of WfFTC payments over time, using information from employers to pick up changes in customers’ income and make timely adjustments. The accuracy of payments also relies on customers providing timely updates on any changes to their circumstances.

| Customers with a Working for Families debit or payment | 2020 | 2021 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Debit greater than $5,000 | 1,700 | 2,000 |
| Debit between $1,000 and $5,000 | 11,500 | 12,700 |
| Debit between $400 and $1,000 | 7,900 | 8,600 |
| Debit between $200 and $400 | 4,700 | 5,200 |
| Debit between $50 and $200 | 6,400 | 6,200 |
| Debit between 0 and $50 | 6,100 | 5,100 |
| Credit between 0 and $50 | 15,800 | 25,300 |
| Credit between $50 and $200 | 12,100 | 8,900 |
| Credit between $200 and $400 | 8,700 | 8,600 |
| Credit between $400 and $1,000 | 17,600 | 16,000 |
| Credit between $1,000 and $5,000 | 27,800 | 26,600 |
| Credit greater than $5,000 | 7,500 | 6,800 |

Results for the 2021 tax year are mixed. On a positive note, 60% more WfFTC customers had a nil or small credit assessment compared to 2020, indicating that more customers are getting close to their entitlement during the year. The high number of customers with larger credit assessments reflects customers who have opted to receive their entitlement as a lump sum.

There was a small (4.3%) increase in the number of customers who had a debit assessment in 2021. Several factors contributed to this result, such as the impact of COVID-19 on employment and income stability for some customers and changes in family circumstances. Also, a number of entitlements were estimated incorrectly for some customers with multiple employers, and where the employer had not provided key information to us. We’re working to prevent this situation from happening again.

Note, results are as at 30 June 2021 and include customers who received an end-of-year square-up for their Working for Families entitlement through the automatic assessment process. Results do not include square-up results for customers who are required to file an IR3 return.
