Expense items in the Table of Depreciation Rates
================================================

Determination lists 'expense items' being removed from the Table of Depreciation Rates and the depreciation determinations in which they appear.

The Commissioner's Table of Depreciation Rates ('the Table') lists general economic depreciation rates and provisional depreciation rates set by the Commissioner. The Table, set out in industry and asset categories, is compiled from Tax Depreciation Determinations issued by the Commissioner.

Several of these determinations include items of property where the Commissioner has not set an estimated useful life and has included the word "expense" in the Diminishing Value Rate and the Straight Line Rate columns. For example in Determination DEP1: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 1, in the "Contractors, Builders and Quarrying" industry category items such as "Abrasive cutting wheels", "Drilling bits (except as shown) and similar tooling", "Drop sheets", and "Grinding wheels" are listed as "expense".

These items were included in the determinations for completeness. However, there is no legislative basis for non-capital items to be included in determinations. Consequently, to ensure that the Table is correct in terms of the legislation, these items are being removed from the Table as indicated below. The Commissioner stresses that correcting the Table by removing these expense items does not affect the income tax treatment of their cost. They will continue to be fully deductible, subject to the usual deductibility tests that require a sufficient connection with an income earning activity or business.

The items are being removed from the Table for one (or more) of the following reasons as noted in the attached table:

1.  They are consumables and fully deductible for income tax purposes (c), or
2.  the replacement of these items, when they are part of a larger item, would qualify as repairs and maintenance (r), or
3.  the items are no longer in general use in the respective industries (n).

Note that if the "replacement" items in number 2 are first purchased as part of a larger capital asset, their cost will generally be included in the cost of the larger item and depreciated at the rate set for that larger item. In such cases the item is only expensed when it is later replaced.

There may possibly be some items of property that are currently shown as "expense" that taxpayers may consider are depreciable property for which an economic depreciation rate should be set.

**\***The Commissioner is considering whether to update the "Computer" asset category in view of the length of time since the depreciation rates for this industry were set (1992) and the advancement in technology since then. If the update proceeds, the Commissioner will be consulting with the industry and, before any new rates (if any) are set, all taxpayers will have the opportunity to comment through the Department's public consultative process.
