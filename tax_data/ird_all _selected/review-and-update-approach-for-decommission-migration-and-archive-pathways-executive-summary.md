The new document is called “D4205 Data Retention Standard”. Key findings from this revision include: •The papers’ key goal is ensuring that IR is meeting the requirements for destruction and retention of data in t he “Inland Revenue Retention and Disposal Schedule”. •Having an automated method of processing data to apply retention and destruction rules. •Archiving system back-u ps enable recovery of lost data but aren’t the official archive. •Heritage application archive data to be moved to the ideal transition repository. Option list provided. •New systems and Heritage systems, that will endure after the BT Programme, need to provide a method to c omply with retention and disposal requirements; this is identified as a key risk. •Ensuring the future-s tate application meets the archive requirements. Conclusions for the Decom processes and its alignment with the strategy: •IR has been following the archiving strategies and progress is currently on track, working through the de commissioning and archiving of the 400-plus Heritage applications. •So far 90 applications have already been decommissioned. Of the 244 apps in scope up to Release 4, 187 are c ompleted. The Decom processes have been enhanced to check viability of what gets archived. •The BT Release 5-tim ed applications are starting their initial analysis. This will be dependant on the Enduring Application managing the disposal requirements. Recommendations: •Note the future apps not meeting the disposal risk identified from the revised Archive Strategy paper D4205. •Note the key IR future-s tate application owners are being followed up to define their archive capabilities as part of the D4205 Archive Strategy review. •Note the new D&A archive assessment governance processes to support the existing Design governance processes. •Note the 2019D 4205 Data Retention Standard is still to be formalised through the TDA governance prior to this document’s TDA discussions. 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] D4197 Review & Update Approach for Decom, Migrate & Archive Pathways Key D4205 Archive Strategy updates The key 2017 Archiving Strategy paper D2132 has been replaced by the 2019 “D4205 Data Retention Standard” paper. This was updated by the BT Release 4 Environments team. The key changesto the 2017 strategy include: •IR needs a data management approach that meets the following key objectives: •Reducing long term cost of storage infrastructure •Ensure that data growth is controlled so that databases remain manageable •Lowering the administrative burden of data management with automation •Meeting requirements for destruction and retention of data in the “Inland Revenue Retention a nd Disposal Schedule”. •Having an automated method of processing data to apply retention and destruction rules. •New systems and Heritage systems that will endure after the BT Programme should provide a me thod to comply with retention and disposal requirements in the primary online data set. •IR to consider if backups should be retained and excluded from retention rules as they are a point in tim e snapshot of the entire data set and will protect against unintentional data loss. •Older systems such as Heritage applications that are being replaced/retired by BT can be dealt with in several ways and will need to be evaluated individually for the most appropriate method based on each system. Refer to Appendix 1 for the approaches and the technology options and Appendix 2 for the example scenarios. •Further follow-up with the key future-state application (START, STAX, DIP and SharePoint) to clarify if they have the required archive rules and process embedded. 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] D4197 Review & Update Approach for Decom, Migrate & Archive Pathways Linking D4205 Archive Framework to the Decom & TDA design processes • Identify data functions (Dat a us e , Search access) • Identify interdependencies • Identify s takeholde rs (user access, frequency) • Identify data structures (Able to view as images, Need for code to interpret data for view) Identify • • • • Dat a C at eg or y • Data Class • Data Sub Class • Retention Period • Retention Approval • Disposal Approval Classify • • • • Disposal Schedule Gove rnance (PRA Executive Sponsor) • Decommissioning Asse ssment TLO Governance • TDA archive design governance Verify Archive P at tern an alys is (Database Archive, Application Image Archive, Data Extract & In Application Archiving) Application Affinity analysis Select target environment Confirm source and des tination sy stems Identify transfer pattern Determine extract and load rules Archive Pattern High Performance Storage (N SP/ Cloud) Low Performance Storage (N SP/ Cloud) Offline Storage Storage Pattern • • • • Request access to archive • Maintain Archive Accessibility & Readability Data Access • • • • Target system data life cycle management functionality setup • Deletion process & approvals embedded • Disposal process set-up. • Ensure archived data is read only and identifiable as archive data.

Refer to Appendix 4 for a detailed process diagram of this activity. This is a formal TDA/TADC governance formal review of the application and business outcomes and what is required to occur to migrate/decommission the application. Key activities •Review business requirements. •Align with the future enterprise capabilities (START, DIP, STAX etc). •Consult with the Business and BT technology stakeholders. •Recommend next steps: •Options for what should be replaced, if required (potential RFP). •No further action, carry on to decommissioning. •Enduring -r equires re-platforming of the current application. •TDA and TADC governance of the assessment. 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] D4197 Review & Update Approach for Decom, Migrate & Archive Pathways Decom team Progress The Decommissioning team has make significant progress with its analysis cycle to decommission every Heritage application. In the master “Decommission & Archive Application Register” (refer Appendix 5 for link), it identified approximately 400+ applications in Heritage that requires a Decommissioning assessment. The review status at the start of October 2019 has 187 completed, of 244 identified, for Release 4 decommissioning. 150 applications are in the BT Release 5 timeframe for archiving. All the applications (classified by BT Architecture application groupings) that are enduring are identified and the analysis for how they will be enduring is in progress. Refer to the “D&A Status report” for the recent progress with Decommissioning.
