For example, if your balance date is 31 December, please provide information for the year ended 31 December 2022. Alternatively, if your balance date is 30 September, please provide information for the year ended 30 September 2023). Please send the form to internationalquestionnaire@ird.govt.nz by 15 April 2024. Part A: Basic worldwide group details at balance date Name of New Zealand parent entity: this is the top tier New Zealand entity with an immediate non- resident shareholder. It may be the New Zealand branch of an overseas company. Where there are multiple entry points into New Zealand, more than one member of the worldwide group may get a questionnaire. Part B: New Zealand financial accounting group numbers ¾The numbers in this part will often come directly from the consolidated financial statements filed with the Companies Office for the New Zealand group. ¾For a branch, use the New Zealand branch accounts. ¾Where there are multiple entry points into New Zealand, report on each group separately (you should have received a questionnaire for each group if its turnover was over $30 million). ¾Where a group has subsidiaries overseas, you may exclude their results but please provide details in an attachment to your response. ¾Figures can be rounded to the nearest thousand. ¾If financial statements are prepared in a currency other than New Zealand dollars, the numbers may be in that currency but please note this in your response. ¾Interest expense and interest income will usually be labelled as such in the financial statements and relate to the borrowing and lending of funds. Please exclude FX gains and losses. Also, please use an attachment to your response to provide any clarification of the figures provided, particularly if they depart from the financial statements. Part C: 7KLQcDSLWDOLVDWLRQ ¾The “debt percentage of New Zealand group” is calculated as per sections FE 14 to FE 16 of the Income TaxAct 2007 (inclusive) and after section FE 13 (“the on-lending concession”) has been taken into account. ¾Rules which came into effect from 1 July 2018 require “non-debt liabilities” as defined in section FE 16B to be deducted from the value of assets. Non-debt liabilities are items like trade credits, GST payable, provisions for employee benefits, financial liabilities from GHULYDWLYHVDQGFHUWDLQGHIHUUHGWD\[OLDELOLWLHV3OHDVHUHIHUWR7,%9RO1R$SULO IURPSDJHDWZZZLUGJRYWQ\] 3 ¾Please remember that the rules apply to a group of non-residents who act in concert and own more than 50% of a company. ¾Please advise us if an election has been made in terms of section FE 30 to include another company in the group and/or the measurement date in section FE 8 is other than the end of the income year. Part D: Transfer pricing Question 1: For the purposes of the question, you can pick a representative month or calculate an average. Treat a full-time employee as one who works more than 30 hours a week. For part- time workers, add the hours worked in a month and divide by 120 to get the number of full-time equivalents. Question 2: For the purposes of this question, the amount earnt would include such items as salary, bonuses and the taxable value of fringe benefits. Question 3 : The primary transfer pricing method is the one which was applied to transactions having the most material effect, being the highest value of transactions. Please provide further details in an attachment if you wish to clarify your response. The transfer pricing methods are those referred to in section GC 13(2) and Chapter II of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations 2017. Question : Illustrative examples of “material changes” are: ¾A change in the characterisation of a subsidiary from a limited risk distributor (e.g. not bearing risks associated with inventory or receivables) in the 202 tax year to a full risk distributor in the 2023 tax year; and ¾A change in risk assumption between associated parties as to who bears freight costs. Please provide further details in an attachment if you wish to clarify your response. Question : “Material structural changes” refers to any significant change relative to the group’s functions, assets held, an d risks borne in respect of its New Zealand operations. The term does not cover continued or incremental developments undertaken in the ordinary course of business or changes in corporate structure such as the establishment of new entities where they do not affect the functions, assets or risks of the New Zealand operations. 4XHVWLRQV$QVZHU\\HVLIIRUH\[DPSOHWKHYDOXHRIWUDQVDFWLRQVZLWK+RQJ.RQJZDV PLOOLRQDQGWKRVHZLWK,UHODQGZHUHPLOOLRQUHVXOWLQJLQWK HPLOOLRQEHLQJH\[FHHGHG Questions 7 and 8: Answers to these questions are to be derived from the same source data and on a consistent basis as the financial information disclosed in Part B. 4XHVWLRQ)RUPRUHLQIRUPDWLRQRQWUDQVIHUSULFLQJGRFXPHQWDWLRQSOHDVHUHIHUWR&KDSWHU9 RIWKH2(&'7UDQVIHU3ULFLQJ\*XLGHOLQHVIRU0XOWLQDWLRQDO(QWHUSULVHVDQG7D\[$GPLQLVWUDWLRQV  4 5 Common errors to avoid Avoiding the errors below will save you time and money. 1)Providing figures for the wrong income year. ➢This questionnaire is for the 2023 income year, which is balance dates falling between 1 October 2022 and 30 September 2023. 2)Not answering questions. ➢Please ensure you have answered all the questions on page 2. ➢Where a value is zero, please enter "0" rather than leaving a box blank. 3)Not following the instructions. ➢For example, please provide net profit before tax, not net profit after tax. 4)Not explaining departures from financial statements. ➢We generally expect figures to align with the consolidated financial statements for the relevant group. It is helpful to provide an explanation where this is not the case, such as when you choose to exclude controlled foreign companies. 5)Copying details from a previous questionnaire. ➢Please note our questionnaire changes from year to year s o please read the form carefully as to the current year’s requirements. 6)Forgetting to send the questionnaire once completed. ➢We follow up all questionnaires not received. 7)Responding for the wrong group. ➢If there are multiple entry points into New Zealand, one group may have a turnover more than $30 million while another may only have a turnover of $5 million. Please do not combine results. Each group will receive a questionnaire if it is significant enough. 8)Not responding to the questionnaire. ➢The questionnaire is compulsory but in the interests of goodwill we do not make a formal request at the outset. It is very important that you complete the questionnaire accurately and by the due date otherwise it will impact on your risk rating and trigger potentially unnecessary enforcement actions.
