=================================================================

Self-employed resident contractors including resident entertainers
------------------------------------------------------------------

All payments (excluding GST) made to you as a contractor make up your gross (total before tax) income. This includes payments received to cover work-related expenses (allowable deductions). You should receive an annual summary of earnings from us showing your gross earnings and tax on schedular payments.

Does tax have to be deducted from the schedular payments
--------------------------------------------------------

Yes, unless one of the following applies:

*   you have an exemption certificate
*   you have a 0% special tax rate certificate
*   the payments are made to your company and they're not payments being made under certain labour hire arrangements.

Filing a tax return
-------------------

You need to file an annual income tax return detailing your gross (before tax) income, the tax already deducted from that income and any allowable deductions for expenses. This enables you to work out the total tax on your taxable income and will determine how much tax you need to pay or be refunded, if any.

If you are providing services as a company, you'll need to file an Income tax return companies (IR4) or if you are providing services as an individual, you'll need to file an Individual tax return (IR3) income tax return.

Deductions from your gross income
---------------------------------

There are a variety of allowable deductions for work-related expenses you can make from your gross income when completing your tax return. You must keep invoices and receipts as evidence to support all expenses claimed.

Please note that having an exemption from tax deductions does not remove any responsibility you may have to pay provisional tax.
