What happens next
-----------------

Everyone in the review will have access to the information you give in your response. If you choose to take part in the hearing, we'll:

*   give you the information provided by the applicant
*   organise a hearing with you that matches your choices in your response.

  

Your responsibilities
---------------------

If you want to take part in the review hearing, we must get your response within 14 days of the date either:

*   the copy of the application was forwarded to you
*   notification of the application was sent.

A hearing takes around 30 minutes and is:

*   informal compared to court hearings
*   held separately with each person in the review
*   for clarifying information.

Hearings are carried out by a review officer who is contracted by us. You can choose whether you take part in the review or not. Taking part allows the review officer to consider your side of the story, as well as the applicant's.

The review officer makes a decision after the hearings with each person involved, usually within 3 weeks. We'll send a copy of their decision, including their reasons for making it, to everyone in the review.

The information you give must be relevant to the review. You should only provide information you're comfortable with giving to the other people in the review.
