**Section 3** extends the definition of New Zealand for tax purposes to include the continental shelf. It will be important to mining industries, particularly petroleum, which may extend their activities off shore.

The special codes of assessment at present applying to activities in New Zealand have been extended accordingly and any income derived from the continental shelf is deemed to have a source in New Zealand.

**Sections 4 and 5** are connected with the machine preparation of assessment notices.

**Section 5** allows the Commissioner to issue an abridged notice of assessment in certain cases, for example, where the taxpayer makes a self calculation of his tax.

#### Retirement From Farming

**Section 8** clarifies what constitutes retirement from farming.

This restriction applies for a period of three years after the end of the income year during which the farm is sold.

#### Incentives for the Fishing Industry

**Section 9** gives a right of election to the taxpayer to deduct revenue expenditure arising from a compulsory survey of a fishing boat either in the year incurred or to spread it forward over the four succeeding years.

**Section 11** provides a further incentive for the fishing industry.

The capital cost of the survey may be written off over a period of four income years. This section also applies to expenditure incurred on or after 15 October 1965.

**Section 14** provides that the capital cost of new buildings or extensions to existing buildings which are for the processing or storing of fish or fish products, and which meet hygiene standards for export, will qualify for additional depreciation allowance of 30%. An apportionment will be made in the case of multi-purpose buildings.

In general the allowance will be at the rate of 20% in the year of expenditure and 10% in the following year.

#### Depreciation

**Section 10** brings the wording of section 113 in line with sections 113B and 114A of the Act. The Commissioner may refuse to allow depreciation where he is not satisfied either that proper records have been kept or that sufficient depreciation has been written off.
