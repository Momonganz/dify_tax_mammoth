Our roadmap for creating change
===============================

The focus areas below work together to meet our representation goals, and cannot be looked at in isolation. Attracting more Māori to Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake means there's an accountability to ensure the environment is supportive of Māori to be Māori and able to bring their full selves to work, and to supporting their career and development. Many of the actions that were initiated over previous years are now being embedded, are part of business as usual, or are part of a continuous cycle of improvement. These actions are not captured as part of this roadmap, which sets out new actions or actions yet to be completed.

Attraction and recruitment
--------------------------

This focus includes actions that contribute to increasing the overall representation of Māori at Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake. Insights can improve our processes to attract more Māori to want to work here. Leveraging multiple different sources and partners to source Māori candidates with the capability we need can create awareness of our organisation as an employer. Attracting more Māori to a range of roles – not specifically ‘Māori roles’ will support a positive shift in representation.

Career and development
----------------------

This focus supports the development of our internal people, through active partnership and working together, ensuring that our practices and processes like Whanake and learning assist Māori to achieve career goals. Supporting non-Māori to grow their Māori cultural capability creates a supportive environment for Māori. Improving our talent management processes increases how visible Māori talent is for career advancement. Over time, this focus supports our representation goals to increase Māori in technical and leadership roles.

The actions listed below are specific targeted examples that relate to Māori and/or underrepresented communities in general. Our enduring approach to supporting the development of our people, includes a focus on supporting leaders to develop their skills to lead diverse teams.

Leadership and the role of people leaders
-----------------------------------------

This focus brings together actions that specifically relate to how people leaders should support their people, with the wider focus on leadership as a capability. Leaders are crucial to how we recruit and develop Māori and support careers. They role model inclusive practices and behaviours and can influence change across the organisation.
