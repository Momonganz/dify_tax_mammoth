Responsible disclosure policy
=============================

This policy is to help you and us, if you find a security issue in our systems.

Inland Revenue (IR) takes the security, confidentiality, integrity and privacy of our information seriously. We are always looking to increase and improve our security. If you think there is a security issue in our systems, please tell us so we can fix it. 

How you can help
----------------

We value your feedback. Letting us know if you think there is a security issue with our systems helps us to maintain the security and privacy of our information.

We will work with you to validate and promptly fix the issue. Where we get a report about systems run by our third-party suppliers we may need to work with you to report the vulnerability to them.

Please only act within the scope outlined in this policy.

We do not pay ‘bug bounties’ or pay for reported security issues.

Acting responsibly
------------------

Make sure you follow the policy guidelines. If you find a security issue in our systems, please do not:

*   breach the privacy of any individual(s)
*   copy, download or disclose to anyone else any information on IR’s systems
*   do anything that impacts or disrupts IR’s systems
*   modify, corrupt, or destroy any information on IR’s systems
*   disclose information about any security issues you may have identified with our systems until we have had an opportunity to fix it.

Our commitment to you
---------------------

If you follow this Responsible Disclosure Policy (including ‘Acting responsibly’) and report a security issue to IR, we commit to:

*   Being as clear and communicative as we can with you.
*   Treating the information you share with us as confidential between us and our suppliers, unless:
    *   Someone else discovers the same or similar security issue in our systems and we are required to act promptly before we’ve had the opportunity to resolve the matter with you,
    *   The security issue in our systems results in a privacy breach and we are required to handle the breach in accordance with the Privacy Act 2020.
*   Not initiating legal action against you using IR’s statutory powers, or by way of a complaint to the police or other enforcement agency, provided you follow this Responsible Disclosure Policy (including ‘Acting responsibly’ above), keep our information confidential, and do not cause damage or disruption to our services or customers.
*   Not suspending or ending your access to our services if you are an IR customer.
*   Working with you to understand and fix the security issue quickly, including an initial confirmation of your report within 7 days of you reporting it.
*   Quickly dealing with vulnerabilities you have told us about.
*   Considering recognition of your contribution with a letter of acknowledgement if you are the first to report the issue and we make a code or configuration change based on the issue.
