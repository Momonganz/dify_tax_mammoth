www.ird.govt.nz Page 1 of 9 Ref: 23OIA1360 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6 October 2022 Dear T hank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 19 September 2022. You requested the following: Under the Official Information Act, I request a copy of the following in relation to the “Regulatory Impact Statement: GST status of statutory and regulatory charges”. We would like further information with the total list of all “250 statutory charges for GST” that was mentioned on page 4 of the RIS related to GST status of statutory and regulatory charges. Background and context The Government has proposed a legislative framework 1 for determining how goods and services tax (GST) applies to goods and services funded by fees, charges, and levies payable under Acts and regulations. The fees, charges and levies payable under Acts and regulations are known as “legislative charges” and are also referred to in the Regulatory Impact Statement as “statutory and regulatory charges”. Under the proposed framework, any legislative charge (excluding fines, penalties, interest, and general taxes such as income tax) would be treated as consideration for a supply of goods and services. This is intended to address uncertainty that may exist under current law in determining whether a legislative charge is sufficiently connected with a supply of goods and services. The proposal is consistent with the intended comprehensiveness of the GST base and the original design decision to include public sector and not-for -profit activities within the GST tax base. More detail on the proposal is included in the following documents: Departmental Disclosure Statement 6 September 2022 http://disclosure.legislation.g ovt.nz/bill/government/2022 /164/ Commentary on the Bill 8 September 2022 https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/ publications/2022/2022- commentary-perm2-bill Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022- 23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) 8 September 2022 https://www.legislation.govt. nz/bill/government/2022/016 4/5.0/LMS749649.html Acts and regulations including fees, charges, and levies To identify the scale of charges that would be affected by the proposal, in May 2022 we searched the Parliamentary Counsel Office website ( www.legislation.govt.nz) using the keywords “fees”, “charges”, and “levies”.
