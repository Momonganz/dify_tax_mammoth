Why paying tax matters Everyone who earns money in New Zealand must pay their share of tax. Here’s how the Government spent our taxes in 2018-19. The government uses taxpayers’ money to pay for services we all need. 4 ird.govt.nz Are you an employer? The following table shows you each type of worker, and whether you need to register as an employer, make deductions and keep records. Type of worker Register as an employer? Make deductions? Keep records? Employee Workers receiving schedular payments Self-employed contractors IR56 taxpayers Volunteers What sort of workers do you have? It’s important you know if the people who you employ are your employees or if they’re self-employed, because this will determine whether you need to register as an employer and make deductions. Deductions can include pay-as-you-earn (PAYE), student loan, child support, KiwiSaver and employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT). See more information on deductions on page 9. You’ll find a list of the tax terms we use on page 17. Our guide Self- employed or an employee? - IR336 will help explain the tax differences between the two. You can find this at ird.govt.nz/forms- guides First-time employer’s guide 5 Employees An employee is someone who works for you and you determine when, where and how they do their work. You need to make deductions from payments you make to employees. Workers receiving schedular payments Some workers are employed under a contract for services and receive schedular payments. These workers are commonly known as contractors and use the WT tax code. The types of work covered by schedular payments are on the back page of the Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C form. You need to deduct tax from payments you make to workers receiving schedular payments, unless they have a certificate of exemption and aren’t being paid under a labour hire arrangement by a labour hire business\*, or they have a 0% special tax rate certificate. You don’t need to make any other deductions like KiwiSaver or student loan deductions from their pay—this is their responsibility. Self-employed contractors Self-employed contractors are workers who don’t receive schedular payments and aren’t employees. They control how they work, provide their own tools and invoice you for their services. You don’t need to make deductions from payments you make to self-employed contractors, but you must still keep records of the person or company and how much you paid them. However, if you have a written agreement with the contractor stating you will treat their payments as schedular payments and deduct tax on their behalf, you’ll need to register as an employer and treat them as a worker receiving schedular payments. Common types of schedular payments are honoraria, and payments made to models, company directors and entertainers. Common types of self- employed contractors include mechanics and plumbers. For more information about workers with a certificate of exemption read our Employer’s guide - IR335. \* Non-resident contractors can use a COE for payments they receive under a labour hire arrangement by a labour hire business. 6 ird.govt.nz IR56 taxpayers The term “IR56 taxpayer” is used to identify workers who are responsible for paying their own tax, can be an employer, but are not self-employed contractors. The most common IR56 taxpayers are private domestic workers, who work part-time, eg: home-helpers caregivers nannies gardeners domestic odd-jobbers. You don’t take deductions from any payments you make to them, but you must still keep records of the person and how much they were paid. Volunteers A volunteer is someone who works voluntarily and doesn’t get paid for it. Even though you didn’t pay them, you should keep records of the person who volunteered and when they worked. For more information on IR56 taxpayers, go to ird.govt.nz/ir56 First-time employer’s guide 7 How to register as an employer If you’ve now decided you’re an employer, you must register with Inland Revenue as soon as you start employing. If you know in advance that someone will be working for you, you can register before they actually start. Step 1: Get an IRD number You need an IRD number to register as an employer. If you’re an individual and want to start employing workers, you can register as an employer under your own personal IRD number. If your business is a partnership, company, trust or other organisation, and doesn’t already have an IRD number, you’ll need to apply for one using an IRD number application - resident non-individual - IR596 form or Non-resident offshore business IRD number application - IR744. Step 2: Complete an Employer registration - IR334 form You can register as an employer online at ird.govt.nz/employers If you don’t have access to the internet, you can call us on 0800 257 773 and we’ll post you the IR334. You’ll receive a confirmation letter and an employer pack within 10 working days of registering. The pack tells you what you have to do and by when. Companies can automatically apply for an IRD number, and register as an employer, when they register with the Companies Office. 8 ird.govt.nz Now you’ve registered, let’s get started Make sure new employees fill in a Tax code declaration - IR330 form. The IR330 will tell you what rate of tax to deduct from their salary or wages and any other deductions to make, eg, student loan repayments. If your worker doesn’t give you a completed IR330, you must deduct tax at the non-notified rate. This is 45 cents in the dollar plus ACC earner’s levy. Make sure new contractors receiving schedular payments fill in a Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C form. The IR330C will tell you what rate of tax to deduct from their schedular payments. Note: there are minimum tax rates that must be used, refer IR335. If they’ve completed the IR330C and haven’t selected a tax rate, use the standard rate listed on the back of the IR330C. If the contractor doesn’t give you a completed IR330C you must deduct at the non-notified rate. This rate is 20% for non-resident contractor companies and 45% for all other contractors. When you start employing, you’ll need to start a record- keeping system. Records need to be kept in New Zealand for seven years. These include: wagebook information PAYE payment receipts completed IR330 and IR330C forms letters from us asking you to change your employee’s tax code or rate. See our Employer’s guide - IR335 for a full list of the records you need to keep. First-time employer’s guide 9 Deductions you need to make You need to make deductions from payments made to employees and from workers receiving schedular payments. Self-employed contractors and IR56 taxpayers don’t have tax deducted. PAYE (pay-as-you-earn) As an employer, you must deduct PAYE from all payments you make to people working for you. The amount you deduct will depend on the code the employee puts on their Tax code declaration - IR330 form. Some employees may have a special tax code which tells you to deduct PAYE at a different rate. Workers receiving schedular payments (WT tax code) have a flat rate of tax deducted. Student loan and child support deductions You may also need to make deductions for student loan and/or child support from your employee’s wages or salary. Some of your employees will use a tax code with “SL” on the end, eg, M SL or S SL. This means they’ll need to have student loan deductions made from their salary or wages together with PAYE. If anyone working for you needs child support deducted from their salary or wages, we’ll send you a child support deduction notice. It will tell you how much to deduct each pay because this depends on their personal circumstances. For employees, PAYE is made up of tax and ACC earners’ levy (which covers the cost of non-work related injuries). For more information on tailored tax codes read our Employer’s guide - IR335. 10 ird.govt.nz KiwiSaver KiwiSaver is a voluntary, work-based savings scheme to help New Zealanders save for their retirement. KiwiSaver is open to all New Zealand residents and people entitled to live here permanently. You’ll need to give each new employee a copy of Your introduction to KiwiSaver - employee information - KS3. If your employees decide to enrol in KiwiSaver, you’ll need to make deductions from their gross salary or wages at their chosen rate (3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10%). You’re also required to contribute a minimum 3% to their KiwiSaver account. These are called compulsory employer contributions. All KiwiSaver deductions need to be paid to us at the same time as PAYE and any other deductions. You shouldn’t give financial advice to your employees. If they have questions about their KiwiSaver options, tell them to talk to an independent advisor or go to the “Sorted” website at www.sorted.org.nz For more detail about your KiwiSaver employer responsibilities, employee enrolment criteria and deductions, see our KiwiSaver employer guide - KS4. Employer’s superannuation cash contribution (employer contribution) and ESCT All contributions you make to your employees’ superannuation funds, including KiwiSaver schemes and complying funds, need to have ESCT (employer’s superannuation contribution tax) deducted. The exception to this is if the employee and employer have agreed to treat some or all of the employer contribution as salary or wages under the PAYE rules. For more information on ESCT and employer contributions read our Employer’s guide - IR335. First-time employer’s guide 11 Any other contributions that employers make to other funds are not liable for ESCT, but are liable for FBT (fringe benefit tax). These funds include: sickness, accident or death benefit funds life, pension, personal accident and sickness insurance policies an insurance fund of a friendly society funeral trusts superannuation schemes that aren’t registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 or haven’t had ESCT deducted. Payroll giving Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme where employees can have donations made directly from their salary or wages to support approved donee organisations and receive an instant tax credit. You can choose whether to set up payroll giving and how it will run. If you do, it’s up to your employees whether they participate. If you choose to set up payroll giving, you must send your employer returns electronically. Read our Payroll giving - IR617 guide for more information. To see a full list of approved donee organisations go to ird. govt.nz/donee For more information on electronic filing, see page 15. 12 ird.govt.nz Fringe benefit tax (FBT) FBT is a tax on benefits or perks that employees receive on top of their salary or wages. All employers who provide benefits must pay FBT. The common types of fringe benefits are private use of work cars, low-interest loans, and free, subsidised or discounted goods or services. If you don’t intend to provide any fringe benefits, you need to select “No” on the Employer registration - IR334 form. If you start providing fringe benefits later on, you’ll need to tell us. Read our Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409 for more information about FBT. How you calculate deductions To calculate PAYE, student loan and KiwiSaver deductions, use our online PAYE/KiwiSaver deductions calculator at ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators The calculator tells you exactly how much to deduct from your employees’ wages. You can personalise it for each employee, which makes it easier to keep deductions separate. You can download and/or print a copy of the results for your records. The PAYE calculator doesn’t calculate the amount of child support to deduct. We’ll send you a child support deduction notice with the amount. If you don’t have access to the internet you can order printed copies of the Weekly and fortnightly PAYE deduction tables - IR340 or Four-weekly and monthly PAYE deduction tables - IR341. First-time employer’s guide 13 Forms you need to complete and send to us You’ll need to fill out a New employee details - IR346 form for each new employee and send it to us with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes their first pay, or earlier.
