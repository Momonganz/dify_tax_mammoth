### Policy report: BEPS Cabinet papers

* * *

1\. This report recommends that you authorise the 3 attached Cabinet papers for lodgement with the Cabinet Office by 10am Thursday 20 July 2017 for the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee (EGI) to consider at its meeting on 26 July 2017.

2\. The three attached papers are:

*   _BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules_. This paper contains measures to limit the ability of multinationals to use interest payments to shift their New Zealand profits offshore.
*   _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_. This paper contains measures to strengthen our transfer pricing rules, counter permanent establishment avoidance and help Inland Revenue deal with uncooperative multinationals.
*   _BEPS – addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements_. This paper proposes measures to remove the tax advantages of hybrid mismatch arrangements.

3\. These 3 papers form a comprehensive package of measures to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). We reported to you on these measures on 22 June 2017 (T2017/1576, IR2017/325; T2017/1577, IR 2017/330; T2017/1578, IR2017/329; T2017/1604, IR2017/353).

4\. We also reported to you on another related Cabinet paper on Thursday 6 July 2017 (T2017/1847, IR2017/410) called Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting. This covering Cabinet paper summarises the background to the 3 attached papers, highlights the most important aspects of the proposed measures, and discusses matters common to all three papers (including application dates, publicity, and financial implications). We recommend that all four Cabinet papers be lodged together with the Cabinet Office.

5\. The following table sets out the next steps for the measures set out in the Cabinet papers.
