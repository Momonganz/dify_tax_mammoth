Depreciation Rate for rail passenger service electric multiple units
====================================================================

Determination DEP95 (2015) sets depreciation rate for a new asset class 'Rail passenger service electric multiple units' under the Transportation asset category.

#### Note to Determination DEP95

The Commissioner has set a general depreciation rate for a new asset class “Rail passenger service electric multiple units” (EMUs), under the “Transportation” asset category, within the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates.

An EMU consists of a self-propelled passenger carriage semi-permanently linked to a passenger trailer carriage (not motorised). There is no separate locomotive as the electric traction motors and drive wheels are incorporated into one or more of the carriages. EMUs are used to provide rail commuter passenger services and are usually formed from two or more semi-permanently coupled carriages, with a drive cab and motor at each end.
