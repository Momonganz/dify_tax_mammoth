Excluded entities and accounts
------------------------------

The CRS automatically excludes a number of types of entities and accounts as being non-reporting financial institutions and excluded accounts.

The CRS also allows implementing jurisdictions such as New Zealand to expand on the list of automatically excluded non-reporting financial institutions and excluded accounts to also include other 'low risk' excluded entities and accounts that meet stringent criteria set out in the CRS. This means these entities and/or accounts would be excluded from due diligence and reporting obligations.

To be considered a 'low risk' entity or account, the financial institution must apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for a determination.

[Common Reporting Standard (Tax Technical)](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/browse-determinations)

Submissions are welcome from financial institutions that are not otherwise excluded, but that meet these criteria and wish to be included in both or one of the following lists.

*   Excluded non-reporting financial institutions.
*   Excluded accounts - for accounts they maintain.

Send submissions to:
