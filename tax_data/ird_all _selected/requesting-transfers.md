Te tono whakawhitinga moni tāwere Requesting credit transfers
=============================================================

You can request a payment or credit transfer in myIR by using the 'Financial transfers' service in the 'Intermediary centre'. Some returns filed in myIR or the Returns Gateway service will allow you to request a credit transfer at the time of filing.

To request a transfer using ‘Financial transfers’ in myIR, you must be linked to the client and have full account access account permissions to the client list for the current location of the credit. However, you do not need to be linked to the recipient of the transfer. Restricted users are not able to use this service.

Tax agents linked to themselves are not treated as a client. This means you cannot perform tax agent specific functions, such as transfers, on your own IRD number. This also prevents agency employees accessing your personal information.

When requesting a credit transfer as part of 'File return' in myIR you also need to have full account access account permission – but if you are using the income tax return service, you can still initiate the credit transfer if you only have file.

Requesting a transfer does not mean we’ll move the credit as requested. When there are higher priority periods or accounts which the credit should go to, the credit will instead follow our automated offset rules, for example if there is a debt in another period.

It is important to tick the ‘Associated person’ check box where applicable when requesting a credit transfer, even if the transfer destination is the same customer. This will ensure the correct effective date is applied.

There are a few other instances where the transfer will not be processed. If this occurs, 1 of the following error messages will be displayed.

### **Error: No credits available to transfer**

This error may display if:

*   there is no assessment in a period, so the credit is locked
*   there is a credit lock, or account halt, on the period
*   the credit arose from a write-off or remission
*   there is a refund created earlier that day which is pending release.

### **Error: Client not available for this service**

This error may display if:

*   the transfer is being requested from your own IRD number
*   you're not linked to the client
*   you're linked, but do not have full account access to the client list where the account is linked
*   the client or the client’s account is:
    *   ceased or deceased
    *   under investigation or special audit
    *   a corporate customer
    *   insolvent by way of bankruptcy, liquidation, voluntary administration, or has been struck off.

Where applicable, the same restrictions and error messages will apply to the destination period.

If a destination client is not available to be transferred to, we will continue to process and release a refund from the source client.

Tax agents cannot transfer credits or payments from certain tax types. These include, but are not limited to, student loans, Working for Families payments and imputation credits.
