Te tuku huringa Delivering our transformation
=============================================

The Inland Revenue transformation website is our way of sharing what we did, and what we learnt, while delivering one of the biggest transformation programmes of its kind. This was a once-in-a-generation change to tax and social policy, something which impacts the whole of New Zealand, from government, through businesses to the country’s people and families.

To capture the size of the task we start by sharing a timeline of activity beginning in 2013 at the inception phase and ending in June 2022 when we closed out the transformation programme.

Our delivery timeline
---------------------

Show all

2013 Inception

### Programme and policy

*   Late 2012, early 2013 Cabinet approved in principle the Business Transformation funding subject to an approved business case.
*   Deputy Commissioner Change role established and appointed. This role had responsibility for our change resources, the transformation programme and was also the Senior Responsible Officer.
*   Recruitment of an experienced transformation specialist team began.
*   The Business Transformation Method was established - the foundation for the programme deliverables and structure, including the programme planning process.
*   First programme structure established – focused round business case development and planning.
*   Established a commercial team – all commercial activity for Business Transformation was managed by the programme.

2014 Foundation

### Programme and policy

We established the foundations of the programme including the:

*   10 keys reporting framework
*   Programme Management Office
*   Initial governance approach including establishing the governance teams and terms of reference.

Other key actions were:

*   Tax policy conference held to gather ideas for ‘Tax Administration for the 21st century' and set the outline for the subsequent green paper.
*   Initial programme leadership team was finalised.
*   Accenture was selected as a programme delivery partner.
*   Initial view of scope and programme phasing established.
*   Change management framework developed – the foundation for all practices and processes.
*   Communications team established to deliver all business transformation communications.
*   High-level design work identifying what the transformation would deliver resulted in the creation of 6 blueprints.
*   Shortlist of three viable core tax solutions identified with site visits to establish capability. This included overseas travel with the then Minister of Revenue.
*   Management consultants, KPMG confirmed as external Independent and Technical Quality Assessment (IQA/TQA) provider.

### Organisation Design

*   Change Management function established to deliver organisation design.

### Technology

*   Foundation programmes initiated to provide technical infrastructure to keep the business running until the new platform was fully implemented.

2015 Mobilisation

### Programme and policy

### Programme and policy

*   Transitioned the programme team structure to a delivery-oriented release structure for core tax and social policy work, introducing delivery teams, for example, testing, deployment and so on.

*   Kaikoura Earthquake hits 14 November, 4 months before stage 1 go-live – main Wellington building closed. Limit of 500 people able to ‘connect’ remotely across the whole of Inland Revenue made remote working extremely challenging.
*   The Taxation Bill 'Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures' was enacted – key activity to pave the way for our digital transformation.

### Stage releases - core tax and social policy

*   High-level release approach agreed - based around product sequencing for example, GST, then income tax, then Working for Families Tax Credits and so on. GST chosen for the first Release (Stage 1), due to its relative simplicity.
*   Detailed delivery work for Stage 1 commences.
*   Agreed that this initial stage would involve a full move of (almost) all customers from FIRST to the new system, but FIRST would remain the customer master until a later release.
