Apply for relief in myIR
------------------------

From your myIR homepage go to the 'I want to...' tab, scroll down to 'Register, application and enrolment and select 'Application for relief'.

Fill in 'Application for relief'
--------------------------------

You'll see the total amount of debt eligible to be considered for relief.

You'll need to tell us:

*   if you have self-employed income
*   if you currently live overseas or returned to New Zealand after being overseas for at least 5 of the last 6 months
*   what events or circumstances are stopping you from repaying the debt
*   why the outstanding amount was not paid on time.

Complete 'Living situation'
---------------------------

If you have dependants, you'll need to tell us:

*   how many
*   how many are over the age of 18.

We also need to know if you live with a partner and details about your housing situation. If you have a mortgage, we'll need the:

*   length, or term
*   total amount.

Enter details for 'Income and assets'
-------------------------------------

For income, you'll need to tell us which currency you're using. We'll need amounts for your:

*   monthly salary or wages
*   pension or any benefits
*   rental income
*   interest or dividends
*   partner's income
*   other sources of income.

For assets, let us know if you have any:

*   vehicles
*   bank accounts with a balance, that is, not equalling 0
*   money owed to you
*   other significant assets.

Enter details for 'Liabilities and expenses'

Add additional information and upload documents
-----------------------------------------------

You must let us know if you do or do not have any [bright-line losses carried forward](/api/glossary/item?id={654D3FBC-D329-4E07-BA25-E4F14994BAD2})
. If you do, then you also need to tell us the amount you are carrying forward.
