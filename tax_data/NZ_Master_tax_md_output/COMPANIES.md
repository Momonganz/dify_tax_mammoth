For tax purposes, a "company" is defined in s YA 1 as "a body

and any society or credit union registered under the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982. A Māori authority is also treated as a company for taxation purposes. The definition of a

corporate or other entity that has a legal existence separate from that of its members, whether it is incorporated or created in New

Zealand or elsewhere". This definition extends to a local authority or a public authority and applies to any company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993, any unit trust, incorporated society or club

"company" excludes any limited or general partnerships (other than certain overseas partnerships and listed limited partnerships), look-

The residence of a company assists in determining exposure to New Zealand tax liabilities. A company that is resident in New Zealand is subject to income tax on all income, irrespective of the country or source of the income. A non-resident company is subject to income

A company is resident if it is incorporated in New Zealand, has its head office or its centre of management in New Zealand or control by its directors is exercised in New Zealand, even if the director's decision-making also occurs outside New Zealand. A non-resident company can be expected to be one that is neither incorporated in nor controlled from New Zealand. The connection with New Zealand may be in the form of an office or other business premises situated in New Zealand. A presence of that kind would not normally impact on control of the company exercised at the offshore head office. A

foreign company would also not be regarded as having a presence in New Zealand merely on account of executives being temporarily in New Zealand while the foreign company is engaged in litigation in

All direct voting and market value interests of less than 10% (except interests held by associated companies) are deemed not to be held separately by the actual shareholders but are regarded as being held by a notional single person. The effect of this is that share transfers between direct holders of less than 10% will have no effect on the continuity of shareholding. The pooling of all the direct interests of less than 10% takes place before the application of the corporate

Closely Held Co, Alan and Rob are treated as a notional single person, so Loss Co would have a shareholding as follows: notional single person = 20%, Jock = 40%, David = 40%.

At 1 April 2016 Loss Co has the following shareholding:

See [¶16-150](#page-14-0) and [¶16-175](#page-20-0). Tracing is made easier, however, through the application of ss YC 10 and YC 11, regardless of whether voting or market value interests are being tested. The pooling concept modifies the general rules governing the general corporate look-through rules of s YC 4.

**Example 1:**

shareholding is as follows:

Because the shareholders with less than an interest of 10% of the company are treated as a notional single shareholder, the shareholding will become: notional single person = 33%, Jock = 40%, Michael = 27%. To determine whether its loss can be

Jock 40% 40% 40%

David 40% 0% 0%

Michael 0% 27% 0%

Loss Co satisfies the 49% continuity requirement despite an actual ownership change of 60% (only Jock remaining as a shareholder). This result follows because all of the less than 10% shareholders are treated as a notional single shareholder. When this occurs, an anti-avoidance provision in s YC 15 [(¶16-205)](#page-33-0) deems the continuity provision not to have been satisfied unless the directors had no knowledge of the actual loss of continuity and the failure to meet the continuity requirements was caused only by on-market sales between less than 10% shareholders in the company. A further concession allows less than 10% interests to be accounted for separately if it

The Commissioner decides under s GB 23 that this fee is excessive and that $100,000 is a more accurate reflection of the market value of the services. Rangitoto Ltd's deduction is therefore limited to a deduction for $100,000, and the remaining $100,000 is treated as a dividend paid by Rangitoto Ltd to the director's husband out of profits derived by Rangitoto Ltd.
