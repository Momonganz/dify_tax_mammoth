The resident withholding tax (RWT) regime has been in operation since 1 October 1989.

For the purposes of RWT, "interest" is defined as a payment in respect of "money lent". This includes credit given. Consequently, there is a potential for all payments on overdue accounts to be "interest" as defined. However, the definition of "exempt interest" (see below) would seem to exclude payments on overdue accounts where the credit given is generally accepted commercial practice and where the purchase of the goods or services is in the ordinary course of the purchaser's taxable activity.

A payment of a guarantee fee would also appear to fall within the definition of "interest", as such a payment is in respect of money lent. It follows that a guarantee fee would be subject to the RWT
