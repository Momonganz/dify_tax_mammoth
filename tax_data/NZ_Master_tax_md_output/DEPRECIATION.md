A buyer of depreciable property who does not have title may still be treated as the owner of the property by s EE 3. A buyer who enters into an unconditional contract to purchase goods, but whose title to the goods does not pass until the purchase price has been paid in full, is treated as the owner of the goods for depreciation purposes from the later of the time the contract is entered into and the time possession is taken.

 F4 (1983) 6 NZTC 59,583 illustrates how the exclusion for property accompanied by a right to compensation applies. The case involved a financier who acquired and leased out premises for 10 years, subject to an option by which the lessee could be compelled to purchase the premises. The purchase price payable upon exercise of the option ensured that the financier would recoup the cost of any improvements added to the premises by the financier over the term of the lease. Since the financier would recover the cost of this capital

Danny operates a printing business and, in the 20X0–X1 income year, he bought a secondhand etching machine for $20,000. The diminishing value rate of 25% was applied to this machine. By the end of the 20X2–X3 income year, it had been depreciated down to $8,437. Danny decided to change from diminishing value to straight-line method from the 20X3–X4 income year. The adjusted tax value before claiming any depreciation for the 20X3–X4 income year is $8,437. According to sch 10, the equivalent straight-line rate to 25% DV is 17.5%.

**Calculation of economic rates**

Commissioner applies the formula:

The factors that are taken into account in making any such assessment

**Example:**

Pat owns equipment which was damaged in the Canterbury earthquakes and is not repairable. In the 2011–12 income year, Pat is able to reasonably estimate that he will receive $1,000 as scrap value for the equipment and that disposal costs will amount to $200. However, the amount of the insurance payment can only be reasonably estimated in the 2012–13 income year. Pat elects to utilise s EZ 23F. Therefore, the 2012–13 income year is the relevant year for the purposes of calculating depreciation recovery income and allowable deductions as this is the income year in which the disposal proceeds, cost of disposal and insurance receipt can all be reasonably

In December 2021, the Commissioner released a QWBA, QB 21/11, "Elections not to depreciate commercial buildings", which sets out the position for taxpayers making an election to not depreciate their commercial building since the depreciation rate of 0% was removed from commercial buildings with effect from the 2021 income year.

The item covers the tax position where a taxpayer makes an election to treat their commercial building as not being depreciable property.

The election is irrevocable, and the taxpayer is bound by that election until the building is disposed of. For the election to be effective, the taxpayer must make it "in writing". A taxpayer who does not make an election and who claims a depreciation loss for their commercial building must continue to depreciate that building

No. The environmental consent can be depreciated from the point where the consent is available to be used. It is available to use, and the costs are depreciable, despite the incinerator not actually being used until the following year.

Depreciable property owned by a person is transferred to the person's administrator or executor on death. For tax purposes the transfer of the property is treated as a disposal at the property's market value immediately before the person's death. The executor is treated as having acquired the property at

The executor is required to ascertain whether the person's death leads to an item of depreciation recovery income that must be recognised in the return of income for the person to the date of death.

As stated above, an exception to this market value approach exists when the distribution is part of an arrangement under which the beneficiary pays an amount for the property that would reasonably be expected to be paid on a disposal at arm's length. There is also another exception to the market value approach. The transfer of depreciable property on the death of a taxpayer to the executor may be treated as a disposal under a settlement of relationship property (see [¶13-580](#page-104-0)) if the deceased's estate vests in the surviving spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner. For this treatment to apply, it is also necessary that those beneficiaries receive by vesting all assets that were in the tax base of the deceased (ie revenue account property, foreign investment fund interests, financial arrangements not

The amount of depreciation

recovery income or depreciation loss on disposal will include the depreciation loss that had been claimed by the deceased and the executor or administrator when those parties owned the asset. Further, if s FC 3 applies, the transferee (being the executor or administrator and later the spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner) cannot claim more depreciation than the transferor would have been allowed.

When property is transferred between associated persons, special rules may apply to restrict the cost base for the transferee when calculating depreciation (see [¶13-400](#page-63-0)).

Utilities distribution networks convey electricity, gas, water and telecommunications. Individual assets within that network, eg power poles, are depreciated at the rate applicable to that item of depreciable

No depreciation rate exists for the composite group of assets that make up the network. Treating the entire distribution network as an item of depreciable property is known as the "network approach". It is common for utility providers to pool "like" assets and depreciate them using the pool method (see ¶13- [144). These asset pools contain a number of generally low-value assets which are similar to each other.](#page-30-0) While asset pools are depreciated using the lowest rate for items in the pool, the item of depreciable property does not lose its individual identity. Therefore, repairs and maintenance are considered in relation to each asset in the pool, not the asset pool itself. The component approach applies from the 2008–09 income year. If a network approach has been used, then the component approach must be
