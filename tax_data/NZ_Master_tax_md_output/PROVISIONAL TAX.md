<span id="page-0-0"></span>**¶22-010 Background to provisional tax**

The concept of provisional tax is based on payments of tax being made while income is still being derived by a taxpayer. Effectively, this amounts to progress payments of tax being made by the taxpayer to Inland Revenue (IR) before the final assessment of tax for a particular year is made. The system will affect most taxpayers who derive income other than income from PAYE income payments (wages and salary), resident

provisional tax is determined by calculating the taxpayer's provisional income, which is

Taxpayers are required to pay provisional tax when their residual income tax (RIT) for the previous tax year exceeds $5,000 (for the 2019–20 and earlier years, $2,500). See

Provisional tax can be calculated using the standard (uplift) method, the estimation method or the GST ratio method or, with effect from 1 April 2018, for the 2018–19 and [later income years, the accounting income method (AIM). See further at ¶](#page-8-1)[22-070](#page-8-0)[, ¶22-](#page-8-1)

Provisional tax is payable in instalments. Provisional taxpayers furnish returns of income at the end of the current year and are then subject to an assessment of income tax. The provisional tax paid is credited against the tax assessed, which will

The due date for a provisional tax payment depends on the method adopted by the taxpayer. In addition, the number of provisional tax instalments depends on which provisional tax method is used and, if the taxpayer is registered for GST, the GST filing

The benefit of estimating provisional tax is that taxpayers can avoid paying too much provisional tax. This situation may occur when the taxpayer's income for a particular year is less than the previous year. Provisional taxpayers with RIT over $60,000 may minimise their exposure to UOMI by estimating or over-estimating their provisional tax.

However, those taxpayers who have RIT under $60,000 may prefer not to estimate as they will be liable for UOMI on any shortfall. Additionally, provisional taxpayers who estimate may be liable to shortfall penalties if reasonable care is not taken when

If a taxpayer discontinues using the GST ratio method before the first provisional tax instalment date, they can elect to use the standard or estimation method of calculating provisional tax. However, if a taxpayer discontinues using the GST ratio method after the first provisional tax instalment date, the taxpayer is required to estimate their provisional tax payments for the remainder of the year. For this purpose, the taxpayer [may provide the estimate in writing or by telephone. See s RC 18(4) and (5) and ¶22-](#page-20-0)

With effect from 1 April 2018, for the 2018–19 and later income years, a new method for calculating provisional tax payable — the Accounting Income Method (AIM) — is available. AIM uses accounting information prepared by a taxpayer for a period as a basis for calculating the tax liability of the business for that period. The resulting amount is payable by the taxpayer as a provisional tax instalment. AIM payments are generated by the accounting software and authorised by the user, whether a business or its advisors. The user confirms the amount to pay and then activates the payment for both GST and provisional tax. The calculation and payment of provisional tax is

Benson Electrical Ltd is considering using AIM. They currently use accounting software, pay GST every 2 months, and have a March balance date. Their accountant talks to them about using AIM due to the unpredictable nature of the contracts they are being awarded. The inability to plan in the past has resulted in exposure to use-of-money interest. They generally have a slow start to the financial year but business picks up in the latter half. Their business is steadily growing and their residual income tax is $180,000 in

They ask their accountant to show them what their provisional tax liability would look like under different

In this scenario, their possible use-of-money interest costs range between nil and $6,880 (based on UOMI rates of 8.22% and 1.02% and taking into account new rules for no UOMI for residual income tax less than $60,000 and no UOMI on the first 2 provisional tax instalments if using the standard uplift method).

The item considers the meaning of "taxable activity" in this context, applying the GST approach, and concludes that anything done in connection with the beginning of a taxable activity is treated as part of that taxable activity. However, if no taxable activity is subsequently commenced, the commencement actions are not sufficient on their own to be treated as a taxable activity. If the taxpayer has RIT of $60,000 or more, QB

19/04 confirms the taxpayer will be liable to interest if they do not make one to 3 instalments of provisional tax, depending on the start date of their taxable activity. If their RIT is less than $60,000, they will only be exposed to interest if they do not pay

their RIT by terminal tax date. The QWBA contains a flowchart and examples to

taxpayers with an initial provisional tax liability will have at least one provisional tax payment to make during the transitional year, unless their first business day occurs within 30 days before the date of instalment F of sch 3 pt A. See s RC 21(4)(c).

When a provisional taxpayer who uses the standard or estimation method registers for GST on a monthly or 2-monthly basis part way through the year, or cancels or has their registration cancelled having paid on that basis, their provisional tax payments do not change as they are due on the same due dates for payment of GST with regard to:

However, the position is not quite so clear for taxpayers who register for GST and elect to account for GST on a 6-monthly basis. On a plain reading of the legislation, they must pay their instalments of provisional tax on whichever dates of instalments C and F for their corresponding income year coincide with the cycle of their taxable periods after they become a registered person. However, IR's view is that they must pay their provisional tax on the old basis until the beginning of their 6-monthly period, that is

The same approach is applied to a taxpayer who accounts for GST on a six-monthly basis when they deregister.

The legislation provides that the next payment will be due on whichever of the 3 standard provisional tax payment instalment dates B, D and F that occurs 30 days from the date of deregistration. For these purposes the date of cancellation of GST registration will be the later of the date on which the cancellation is notified and the date on which the taxpayer ceases to be liable to be registered under s 52 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

An initial late payment penalty of 1% is applied to the amount of the unpaid tax from the day after the due date for payment. A further initial late payment penalty of 4% is charged if the tax remains unpaid 7 days after the due date (ie the additional 4% penalty is imposed on the 8th day after the due date). Before 1 April 2017, this was also followed by a monthly incremental penalty of 1% until the date of payment, but this was removed in relation to provisional tax from the 2017–18 income year. See s

Each additional penalty is applied on a compounding basis, ie it is imposed on any unpaid provisional tax plus any late payment penalties that have been imposed in respect of that unpaid tax. Section 139B(6) defines the term "tax to pay" as meaning an amount equal to the unpaid tax together with any late payment penalty that has been imposed in whole or in part in respect of the unpaid tax, to the extent that at that time the amount remains unpaid.

Because the last instalment date falls after a taxpayer's balance date, it is expected that a taxpayer should be able to make a payment at the third instalment date that covers their RIT for the year and they will therefore have no UOMI charge for the year.

Wooley Shearers Limited (Wooley) provides shearing services to farmers. The company has difficulty estimating its provisional tax for the year as it charges by the weight of the wool and the amount of income derived depends on the growing rate of the sheep. In the 2017 income year, Wooley has residual income tax of $260,000. Wooley has filed its 2017 tax return before the first instalment of provisional tax and decides to pay its 2018 provisional tax using the standard method. This will require it to pay 3 instalments of $91,000, which it does on the respective dates. However, because of ideal wool-growing conditions, Wooley has a standout 2018 year and at the end of the year Wooley calculates its residual income tax as $390,000. This

When a taxpayer pays all of the required instalments under the standard method for the tax year (other than the last one) on or before the relevant instalment date, the amount of their RIT for that year less the amount already paid will be due on the last instalment date for that year.

When Wooley completes its tax return for the 2019 year it calculates its final tax liability for the year as $655,000.

In the 2018 income year TWFL had residual income tax liability of $55,000. Because of the uncertainty of the future of this innovative irrigation method, TWFL decides to use the standard method to pay provisional tax for the 2019 income year. It calculates it is required to make 3 instalments of $19,250 ((105% × $55,000)/3). TWFL pays its first instalment on time but between the first and second instalment dates the Government approves the introduction of beavers for irrigation schemes in New Zealand and TWFL's workload increases dramatically. Because of this TWFL forgets to make its second provisional tax instalment. At the date of the third instalment, TWFL realises it has missed the second instalment and also calculates that because of the massive increase in consulting revenue its year-end tax liability is expected to be $1,250,000. TWFL want to minimise the impact of UOMI and so, on the final instalment date, the company makes a payment of $1,231,239 based on the estimate of its final tax liability. This is made up of the tax

When it completes its tax return, TWFL calculates its final tax liability as $1,250,000, as it expected.

A retrospective amendment, made in March 2020, inserted s 120KF with effect from 1 April 2017 for the 2017–18 and later income years. The section includes a tolerance to allow taxpayers to retain the benefit of the safe harbour even if they have underpaid by a small amount. It provides that despite a provisional taxpayer underpaying an instalment by $20 or less, the taxpayer is treated as paying the instalment in full for

In a transitional year (see [¶22-120](#page-29-0)), interest applies to any unpaid tax in relation to the instalments payable in the months set out in sch 3, pt B. See [¶22-012.](#page-0-1) The date interest starts is the day after the day on which payment of the instalment is due under s RC 21. The amount of each instalment is the proportion that the instalment period bears to the length of the transitional year. The final instalment is the income tax liability for the transitional year less any amounts due on earlier instalment dates. The difference between these deemed amounts and the amounts actually paid by the taxpayer is subject to UOMI, unless the taxpayer is a safe-harbour taxpayer and not a new provisional taxpayer. See s 120KD of the TAA for statutory guidelines and an

The general rule is that payments made by a taxpayer for a return period are applied first to the payment of accrued interest and then to unpaid tax. When there is more than one amount of unpaid tax, payments are applied to the oldest debt within a period first. See s 120F of the TAA. The section contains the following illustrative

Note that special ordering rules previously applied when a payment was made before the third instalment date to reduce an amount of unpaid provisional tax. See former s 120L(2) and (3). Instead of being applied first to interest, the payment was applied to

provisional tax due on an instalment date of the Commissioner's choice or on an instalment date specified by the taxpayer. These provisions were designed to ensure that UOMI was applied on a simple, rather than a compounding, basis on outstanding provisional tax payments — the original policy intent. In effect, a taxpayer could "stop

the clock" on UOMI when they made a top-up payment. However, note that for payments made after the third instalment date, payments would be apportioned to

Under IR's old system (FIRST system) there was an extremely complex process for tracking the issue of statements and the calculation of UOMI to be cancelled. This often resulted in taxpayers being left with an overpayment of interest that must be transferred or refunded. IR have migrated to the new START environment and has moved to a monthly billing cycle where UOMI is only be charged at the same date every month. The idea was to eliminate the need for the 30-day rule. All taxes have now migrated to START and the issue should be resolved. Amendments to s 183C provide that when a taxpayer receives a statement, no UOMI will be charged between the date of the statement and the date of payment of all the tax, penalties and UOMI charged on that statement if that date is within 30 days of the issue of the statement.

Provisional tax pooling is intended to give taxpayers an opportunity to reduce their exposure to UOMI on underpaid tax and to increase interest received on overpaid tax.

Generally, under provisional tax pooling, taxpayers make payments to an authorised intermediary who manages underpayments and overpayments on the participating taxpayer's behalf. Actual payment of the taxpayer's provisional tax liabilities is made by the intermediary. Underpayments of tax will be offset against overpayments within the same pool. The pooling regime allows one taxpayer to pool payment with those of

Compared with the UOMI rates paid or charged by IR, the intermediary should be able to pay a higher rate of interest to taxpayers who have overpaid their tax into the pool and charge a lower rate of interest to those who have underpaid their tax into the pool.

Generally, the UOMI provisions apply to an intermediary operating a tax pooling account. A deposit in a tax pooling account is treated as tax paid by the intermediary for the purpose of calculating UOMI.
