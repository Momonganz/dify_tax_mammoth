The late filing penalty is not imposed for a first instance of late filing of employment income information in a 12-month period. After an initial failure to file employment income information on time, the Commissioner has to notify the employer that a late filing penalty will be payable for a further failure. After a further failure to file within 12 months of the first, the Commissioner has to notify the employer that the penalty is payable. The key date for determining whether there is a penalty is the month in which the information is

Premiums paid by an employer on income protection insurance policies taken out for the benefit of an employee are specifically excluded from the definition of "expenditure on account of an employee" (see s CE 5(3)(j)) and therefore not subject to PAYE.

Since the release of the initial rulings, there have been multiple subsequent rulings on

Julie was paid $300 in sick leave under the Holidays Act 2003 and $1,700 in long service leave under her employment agreement. Julie's employer later discovers that both payments were incorrectly calculated. Julie should have been paid $350 in sick leave and $2,000 in long service leave. The difference between the amounts paid to Julie and Julie's actual entitlements is $350. Julie's employer pays her $200 to satisfy part of the difference. The payment of $200 is a remedial payment. Later, Julie's employer pays her $150 to satisfy the remainder of the difference. The payment of $150 is a separate remedial payment. Each remedial payment is treated as an extra

Miriama is a voluntary regional coordinator for a national sports organisation, SportCo. Some travel to local centres, as well as attendance at tournaments is involved. Miriama uses her own car. SportCo pays Miriama an honorarium of $50 per month for 6 months of the year. SportCo estimates that Miriama travels an average of 250 kilometres per month in the course of her voluntary activities, including her travel to and from her home. SportCo decides to reimburse Miriama's travel expenses by paying her a travel allowance of 70 cents per kilometre. The honorarium and travel allowance are paid together. SportCo also gives Miriama meal vouchers to buy meals on the days that she has to attend tournaments. Miriama receives a total payment of $225 in each of the 6 months of the year. SportCo will deduct tax of $16.50 from the monthly payment of $225. The $50 honorarium is subject to withholding tax at the 0.33 rate, and the $50 is included as a schedular payment in the employer monthly schedule. SportCo will pay the $16.50 tax deduction to Inland Revenue. The $175 travel allowance is treated as exempt income. The meal vouchers fall within the scope of the exempt income

An employee share scheme trust for Employer Co acquires 700 Employer Co shares on market for $2.50 per share. Six months later, when they are worth $3 per share, it allocates them to an employee for $2 per share. The purchase price is funded by a loan from Employer Co. If the employee is still employed by Employer Co after one year, the employee will receive a $1,400 bonus from Employer Co (grossed-up for PAYE), which must be used to repay the loan. Otherwise, the employee must return the shares to the employer in full repayment of the loan at the time she leaves employment.

The trustee's acquisition of the shares is treated as an on-market acquisition of

treasury stock by Employer Co. Because the shares are allocated to an employee within 12 months of acquisition, the acquisition is not treated as reverting to an on-market cancellation under section CD 25(2). Therefore the amount paid to acquire the shares does not reduce Employer Co's ASC and the $1,400 paid by the employee to acquire

In May 2023, IR released an updated public ruling in the cryptoassets series: BR Pub 23/07, "Income tax — application of the ESS rules to employer issued crypto-assets provided to an employee" (see also BR Pub 23/04 and BR Pub 23/05, which replaced BR Pub 21/01 and BR Pub 21/02, at [¶3-198](#page-61-0), and BR Pub 23/06 at [¶21-436](#page--1-32)). BR Pub 23/07 considers the income tax treatment of employer-issued cryptoassets provided to employees, where the cryptoasset issued is a share in the employer (ie provides an interest in the capital of the company), the employee is not required to pay market value for the cryptoasset and the cryptoasset is not provided under an exempt ESS.
