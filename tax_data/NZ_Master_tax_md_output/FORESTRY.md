**Law:** IT07 ss DP 10(2), FB 6, FB 7

The Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 defines a "forestry right" as a right granted in accordance with that Act. Briefly, an owner or lessee of land can create a forestry right by creating, granting or

reserving the right to establish, maintain and harvest or to maintain and harvest a crop of trees on the land. The forestry right may also grant or reserve rights of access and rights of construction and use of tracks, culverts, bridges, buildings and other works and facilities if those rights are ancillary to and necessary for the purposes of the

rights created. In addition, the forestry rights may provide for
