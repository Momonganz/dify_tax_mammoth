The qualifying company (QC) regime is an elective regime contained in subpart HA. Overall, the QC rules aim to treat small, closely-held

companies in a similar way to partnerships. This is achieved by deeming the shareholders and the QC to be one entity for tax purposes. However, all the benefits of corporate ownership, in

A QC pays only 2 types of dividend — taxable but fully imputed

dividends, or exempt dividends to resident shareholders. A QC pays taxable dividends to the extent of the amount of imputation credits it

has available to attach. After that, the dividends that the company pays are exempt from income tax. This offers shareholders tax-free access to capital gains derived by closely-held companies without

liquidation of the company. This is regarded as a major advantage of QC status. However, shareholders are liable for the tax on assessable

(LTC) or change to another business entity without tax cost between 1 April 2011 and 31 March 2013. Companies that were not already QCs as at 1 April 2011 are no longer able to enter the QC regime.

The changes grandparent the QC rules for existing QCs and LAQCs only. That is the QC rules still apply going forward to QCs existing at 1 April 2011 unless they are liquidated, choose to revoke their QC election, or use the transition rules to transition to another entity. A further change from 1 April 2017 ensures QC status will also be lost

Closely held companies are companies with few shareholders. Although many of these companies use the general tax rules to

govern their interface with shareholders, there are specific tax rules available for certain types of closely held companies. Since the early

1990s, very closely held companies had been able to pass capital gains and company losses through to shareholders by electing to become a QC or an LAQC. In 2010, the government announced major changes to those specific tax rules, essentially removing LAQCs, closing off the QC rules for new entities and providing a replacement option that enabled a closely held company to be treated as if it were a partnership.

purchase a "something" that will derive assessable income for the LTC is included in this definition of "a thing". The effect is that this provision treats the LTC's action as being those of the owner for income tax purposes. The provision does not work in reverse. The underlying principle that supports the deductibility of interest is the use of the borrowed funds by the LTC, not the use of the funds by
