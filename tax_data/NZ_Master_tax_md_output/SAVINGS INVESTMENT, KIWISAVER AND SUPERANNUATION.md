**PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ENTITY**

The portfolio investment entity (PIE) regime is a system for taxing collective investment entities that operate principally at the retail (or individual investor) level. A collective investment vehicle may attract funds for investment on a portfolio (passive) basis from both retail investors and wholesale investors. The PIE regime provides that the

returns of retail investors are effectively subject to the imposition and payment of income tax in the hands of the PIE as a collective investment vehicle. This relieves the investor from the obligation to

furnish a return of income reporting the investment income and making payment of the tax. Wholesale investors and certain other eligible investors in the PIE may be treated as "zero-rated" investors so as to be personally liable to report and pay tax on the investment
