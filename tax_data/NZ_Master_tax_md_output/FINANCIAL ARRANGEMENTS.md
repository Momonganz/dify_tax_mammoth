Since the test is a subjective one, IR cannot ignore a lowest price that has been genuinely agreed between the parties. If the parties have agreed upon a lowest price which results in an interest rate of 9%, IR cannot ignore that because it considers that a rate of 15% is a more realistic market rate. The test, however, is the lowest price that the parties would have agreed upon, not the lowest price that

the parties state that they agreed upon. IR may consider the

a person asserts that they are in business. In that situation, IR can look to the objective facts for assistance in determining whether the person genuinely had a profit motive despite the person's assertion.

The fact that the test is a subjective one does not mean that it is decided purely on the claims of the person. The test is what the parties really agreed upon, not what they claimed to have agreed.

The following examples to illustrate the lowest price concept were

A taxpayer with accumulated losses of $400,000 sells a capital asset for a deferred payment of $500,000. The asset is valued at $450,000. Possession of the asset is to pass immediately and payment is to take place in 18 months. The parties state in the agreement for sale and purchase that the lowest price they would have agreed upon for immediate payment is $100,000. The objective facts, however, suggest that the lowest price was asserted by the parties in order to transfer the advantage of the vendor's tax losses. In this situation, unless there is some compelling evidence, Inland Revenue would not accept the taxpayers' assertions that $100,000 was the lowest

One company sells another company a building for $10 million with payment to take place 12 months after possession passes. In most circumstances, Inland Revenue would not accept that $10 million was the lowest price that the parties would agree upon if payment was made when the first right in the property passed. The parties may assert this but, in many cases, the surrounding circumstances would not support the assertion. Assuming that the taxpayers are commercially sophisticated, it would be reasonable to assume that they had considered the time value of money. If the compensation in the nature of interest was disguised in the purchase price, it would

substitutes. Accordingly, the lowest price concept for agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services does not apply if it is part of a wider financial arrangement. A wider financial arrangement containing a group of inter-related arrangements cannot be properly characterised as an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services, even though some of the constituent arrangements may

Unfortunately, the Commissioner did not elaborate on why it is that all inter-related arrangements, of themselves, should be regarded as

The cash price provisions raise the issue of whether the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act will have application to the agreement, option or lease in question. Part 5 of the Act applies to every credit contract irrespective of whether it is a consumer credit contract. See s 117 of that Act. A credit contract is one under which credit is or may be provided, while the notion of credit is defined in s 6 as the right to defer payment of a debt, to incur a debt and defer its payment, or to purchase property or services and defer payment for the purchase (in whole or in part). Since the notion of a credit contract parallels the definition of a financial arrangement in the form of an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or

The topic of the forgiveness of debt in a family context had been addressed in a public binding ruling. The binding ruling (BR Pub 99/7) commented that the phrase "natural love and affection" is

affection that the person has for another. An action undertaken in

The Privy Council considered that this argument resulted in putting the avoidance provisions to a very unusual use. Those provisions contemplate that the circumstances that justify application of the avoidance provisions will be specific to a particular transaction,

arising out of the relationship between the parties and other relevant circumstances. In this respect, the financial arrangement avoidance provisions are similar to the general anti-avoidance provisions. What the 2 sections have in common is that, generally speaking, they are aimed at transactions that in commercial terms fall within the charge to tax but which have been, intentionally or otherwise, structured in

such a way that, on a purely juristic analysis, they do not. That is what is meant by defeating the intention and application of the statute. In the present case, there was no tension between the
