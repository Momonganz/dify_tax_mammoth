As Kitty's gain on disposal of her partner's interest is greater than $50,000, the general de minimis exemption in s HG 5 will not apply. However, the specific exemptions may still apply and will need to be considered in relation to each type of partnership asset

As the building has a historical cost of more than $200,000, the depreciable property exemption will not apply. Kitty will therefore be required to pay tax on $25,000 being the taxable gain on sale of the building. Upon Uncle Saul's entry into the partnership, Uncle Saul's cost base will equal the portion of the purchase price attributable to the building. As the partnership's turnover is less than $3 million, the trading stock exemption in s HG 6 will apply. This means that Kitty will not be required to account for tax on the disposal of trading stock. Instead, effectively Uncle Saul will step into Kitty's shoes and acquire Kitty's interest in the trading stock. However, the effect of this is that Uncle Saul will acquire a cost base equal to Kitty's cost base in the trading stock even if he has paid a price based

Tom's limited partnership deduction in year 2 is $140,000 (being his 50% share of year 2 deductions of $125,000 plus deductions carried forward from year one of $15,000). As Tom's basis is $150,000, he will be entitled to claim the full partnership deduction of $140,000. Therefore, in year 2 Tom will return partnership income of $150,000 and partnership deductions of $140,000, giving Tom net partnership income of $10,000.

It is important to distinguish between a partnership and a joint venture

as the 2 entities are taxed differently and file different income tax returns. No joint return of income is required by persons other than partners. Therefore, each member of an unincorporated joint venture

files its own income tax return, and there is no joint tax return.

Perhaps the most important distinction between a partnership and a joint venture is that a partnership is an association of persons who

engage in a common undertaking for profit, whereas a joint venture is
