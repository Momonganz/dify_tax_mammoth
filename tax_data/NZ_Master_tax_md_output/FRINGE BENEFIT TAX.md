FBT continues to fulfil its original purpose — serving as a backstop to the PAYE system by taxing non-cash employee benefits. However, a report of the findings ("Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review", August 2022) found that FBT is not without its issues. The

most common issue identified was that FBT is a complex tax to

comply with. The interaction of FBT with other regimes, such as the PAYE rules and the entertainment rules, is also seen as problematic.

Officials have recommended several options for change, including a full review of the FBT rules as the preferred option. The next option would involve a small-scale or remedial project which would focus on

A fringe benefit exists where an employee has the benefit of a motor vehicle that is made available for the employee's private use and the motor vehicle is owned, leased or rented by the person who makes the vehicle available to the employee. A fringe benefit also exists when a vehicle is made available for an employee's private use and the person who makes the vehicle available to the employee has a

right to use the vehicle under an agreement or arrangement with the employee or an associated person of the employee. This means that "9-to-5" or business leases are no longer effective for FBT purposes. If the vehicle is provided by another person (a third party) under an

arrangement with the employer, it is generally treated as having

been provided by the employer. A "motor vehicle", for the purposes of FBT, has the same meaning as in s 2(1) of the Transport Act 1998 and includes most motorcycles, mopeds, cars, station wagons, vans and light trucks, but does not include any vehicle with a gross laden weight exceeding 3,500 kg.

The Commissioner regarded the station wagons as motorcars within the definition of s 336N of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the FBT rules) and assessed them for FBT. The High Court held that the wagons were not motorcars within the meaning of the FBT legislation because they were not designed exclusively or principally for the carriage of persons. They were designed to carry goods as well. If the vehicle is designed equally for 2 purposes, neither one can be called the "principal" purpose.

Because the business travel exemption cannot apply, whether a vehicle is subject to FBT on a day that the vehicle is parked at an airport must be determined according to whether the employer has made the vehicle available to an employee for their private use on that day. In this example, CWL has effectively removed Chris's access to the vehicle by requiring him to fly to Napier on business. This means that CWL is no longer making the vehicle available to Chris for his private use. CWL still needs to account for FBT on the day of departure and the day of return, as Chris's vehicle is not subject to a private use restriction.

During the quarter ending 31 March 2024, Mr TP had one of his employer's motor vehicles available for private use. The vehicle cost $28,500 (GST-inclusive) of which Mr TP paid $5,000. During the quarter, the vehicle was in the workshop for one week, was used to make 2 emergency calls and was taken away on a sales trip for 10 days. Mr TP made a contribution of $20 per week to the private running costs. Mr TP's employer uses the cost price basis to calculate FBT on the vehicle and chooses to pay FBT in this quarter at 49.25%. The number of days a fringe benefit was conferred is:

Marjorie is the top salesperson at Bob's Discount Furniture Ltd for 2018. As part of an incentive programme, Marjorie is to be awarded a brand new 49-inch TV, valued at $2,000 (GST inclusive). However, Marjorie would like something a little larger. She has her eye on a 65-inch smart TV currently selling for $3,000 (GST inclusive). Before Bob goes to purchase the TV for Marjorie (from a third-party supplier), she asks if she can pay the difference so she can get the TV of her dreams. Bob is happy to oblige, so Marjorie transfers $1,000 into the company account and Bob buys her the $3,000 TV.
