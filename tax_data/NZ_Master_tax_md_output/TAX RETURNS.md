provisional tax. Maddie started up a new business on 1 July 2022. On the advice of a friend who is a chartered accountant, Maddie makes voluntary income tax payments for the 2022–23 income year amounting to $9,000. The payments are all made before 31 March 2023 (Maddie's balance date). Maddie's first year of business is better than she expected. Her residual income tax for the 2022–23 income year is calculated to be $15,000. Maddie files her 2022–23 tax return on 30 June 2023 and also applies for the early-payment discount. Assuming no discount rate has been prescribed by Order in Council, the amount of Maddie's early-payment discount is $388 (ie 4.31% of $9,000). This amount is credited to Maddie's 2022–23 income tax account and is

Persons with a standard balance date (ie those who have a balance date of 31 March) will generally have a due date for terminal tax of 7 February. However, if they are linked to a tax agent, the terminal tax

date is 7 April. Terminal tax payment dates for persons with nonstandard balance dates, and provisional taxpayers, fall on the 7th day of the month as specified in sch 3 to the Act. See [¶22-012.](#page--1-23) However, if the month is January, the due date will be the 15th.

The Commissioner is required to refund tax if it represents an excess over the tax properly payable, the amount has arisen on an original assessment and the Commissioner is satisfied of the entitlement to the refund. In the case of an amount that has arisen on an amended assessment, the Commissioner is only required to refund tax (which includes refundable tax credits) if the Commissioner is satisfied of the entitlement to the refund before the end of the relevant 4-year time bar in s 108 of the TAA (see [¶4-110](#page--1-18)), any extended period for applying for a tax credit allowed under s 78B of that Act, or the 7-
