Under the imputation system, a company effectively attaches income

dividends and taxable bonus issues distributed to shareholders. The shareholders then use those imputation credits to reduce their own tax liability in respect of the company's dividends. The shareholder includes both the dividends and the imputation credits as assessable income, with a credit being allowed against the shareholder's income tax liability for an amount equal to the attached imputation credits.

The imputation system commenced on 1 April 1988 with the

An individual on a marginal tax rate that is less than the company tax rate receives surplus imputation credits to offset against their income tax liability for the year. Any individual's unused surplus

imputation credits may be carried forward as a credit of tax to the next income year. The amount carried forward is reduced firstly by any amount extinguished when outstanding tax is written off (see [¶2-119)](#page--1-0), and secondly by any tax liability for the next income year.

(For certain other types of taxpayers (eg companies, trustees and Māori authorities), surplus credits may be carried forward as a tax loss and offset against net income of succeeding income years.) See ss LE 2, LE 3, and [¶2-110.](#page--1-1) An individual taxpayer on a marginal tax rate that is higher than the company tax rate will receive insufficient

Every resident company is required to maintain an imputation credit account (ICA) to track their imputation credits on an annual basis. An ICA is a memorandum account only. Tax payments made by a company are credited to its account, and as those tax payments are
