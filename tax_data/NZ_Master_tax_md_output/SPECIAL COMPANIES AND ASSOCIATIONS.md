Clubs, incorporated societies and co-operatives consist of groups of people who have generally joined together to further some common purpose. A principle of income tax is that people cannot make profits

by trading with themselves. An extension of this is that amounts arising from transactions between members of mutual associations are not deemed to be gross income and consequently associations are required to return only amounts arising from transactions with non-members. The taxation provisions relating to clubs and societies

are contained throughout the Income Tax Act 2007 (IT07). The starting point, however, is that incorporated bodies are taxed as

consideration of the authorities, the promotion of a horse race is not a charitable purpose in and of itself. The High Court noted that the Charities Commission (now known as the "Board") registered mixed trusts on the condition that any private objects of a charitable entity would not be given any effect by the trustees or governance body of the entity. The single issue before the Court, in this case, was, therefore, whether the provision of prize money for an annual and significant race on the New Zealand horse-racing calendar was a charitable purpose. The Court analysed

The focus of the case was on the fourth general benefit head. The Court proceeded on the basis that the purpose of the trust was either the support of the Travis Stakes

After reviewing the sports and leisure cases, the High Court found that the weight of authorities ran powerfully against a finding that a gift towards the prize in the Travis Stakes was charitable. The High Court did note, however, that recent New Zealand cases tended to support the idea that the concept of charitable purpose was evolving in response to changing social and cultural circumstances. In the area of sport and leisure, the general principle appeared to be that sport, leisure and entertainment for their own sake were not charitable, but, where these purposes were expressed to be and were, in fact, the means by which other valid charitable purposes, such as health

As noted above, the promotion of amateur sports can qualify as a charitable purpose if it is the means by which a charitable purpose is pursued. This applies from 25

beneficiaries of the trust in this case would be the members of the Cambridge Jockey Club. After drawing all the principles together, the High Court found that the purpose of the trust was to fund a race for the benefit of the Cambridge Jockey Club's race programme. As it was a private club, the High Court held that the Cambridge Jockey Club was not the community, or a sufficient enough section of it, to amount to "the public". Even if the Cambridge Jockey Club did, in fact, constitute the community or an appreciable section of it, the promotion of horse racing generally was not a charitable purpose in and of itself. The Court said that "a trust to promote racing could only be charitable in nature if its deeper purpose was the pursuit of some other

Charitable trusts are attractive to businesses, the main benefit being the exemption from income tax. Any organisation intending to set up a non-profit body would most probably seek to establish a charity as its first option. For example, a large company seeking brand image may choose a charity in which the charity, through the use of the company logo or name, indirectly promotes the institution setting it up. A charity can be set up by a trust deed, an incorporated society

or a charitable company that would be limited by shares or by

guarantee. For tax purposes, any institution or society may qualify.

Business income, in terms of the exemption, is exempt only to the extent that it is derived for charitable purposes within New Zealand.

This is referred to as the territorial restriction in OS 22/04. The income of a business having charitable purposes both here and
