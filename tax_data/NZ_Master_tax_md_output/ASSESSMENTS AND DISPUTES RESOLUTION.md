<span id="page-0-0"></span>**¶4-010 Introduction to assessments**

For income tax purposes, an assessment is defined as an

assessment of tax by either a taxpayer or the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (Commissioner), any amendment made by the Commissioner to an assessment and an assessment of net loss, terminal tax or a refund. Under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, an assessment means an assessment of a GST refund.

The liability for tax exists whether a taxpayer assesses their own liability. Consequently, the late filing penalty continues to apply.

judgment as to that statutorily imposed liability. See

Hewin

The making of an assessment, including an amended assessment, requires the exercise of judgment on the part of the Commissioner in quantifying that liability on the information then in the Commissioner's possession. It involves the ascertainment of the taxable income and of the resulting tax liability. A decision that is tentative, provisional, conditional or subject to adjustment is not an assessment within the meaning of the tax legislation. To constitute an assessment for income tax purposes, the Commissioner's decision must be definitive as to the liability of the taxpayer at the time it was made and final subject only to challenge through the objection process.

A taxpayer's non-standard balance date of 30 September 2018 is deemed to be in respect of the 2017–18 corresponding income year, ie 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018.

In a preliminary hearing, the TRA considered whether the time bar waiver created a separate limitation period under s 108B that could not be extended and concluded it did not. By signing the waiver, the parties simply agreed that the imposition of the time bar specified in s 108 would be delayed for a period of 12 months. The purpose of s 108B was to remove the need for the Commissioner to issue an assessment based on incomplete facts because the time bar against reassessment was due to come into effect. There was no obligation on a taxpayer to agree to an extension of time. There was no restriction on the application of s 108B to situations where an investigation was underway or to the circumstances when the Commissioner and a taxpayer can agree to a waiver. In that case, the Commissioner issued amended assessments after the end of the waiver under s 108(2) as she had formed the

opinion that the returns were fraudulent or wilfully misleading or omitted income. See

Tax Information Bulletin

See [275]–[287] of the standard practice statement SPS 23/01,

Except in cases in which a taxpayer has knowingly or fraudulently failed to make full and true disclosure of all material facts necessary to determine the taxpayer's GST liability, there is also a 4-year time bar for GST returns filed. Generally, the time allowed for making or amending assessments is limited to 4 years from the end of the GST return period in which the GST return was provided. See s 108A of
