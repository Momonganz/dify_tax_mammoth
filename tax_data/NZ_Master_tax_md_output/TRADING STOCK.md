The trading stock rules reflect this approach. These rules apply to the trading stock of any person who owns or carries on a business.

The value of trading stock at the beginning of the year (opening value) is treated as a deduction for that income year. The value of the trading stock at the end of the income year (closing value) is income for the year. The difference between the 2 is taken into account in calculating the net income or net loss for that income

A company buys up old washing machines and refrigerators and renovates them for resale. For the 20X4 income year, it had opening stock of $40,000 (as at 1 April 20X3) and closing stock of $65,000 (as at 31 March 20X4). Its annual sales came to $90,000

and it spent $30,000 acquiring old units, $35,000 on renovation and labour, and $2,000 on new parts during the year. The amount to be taken into account when calculating the company's net income or net loss for that year is as follows:
