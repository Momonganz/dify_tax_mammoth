Thus, the provision deems the PE to exist for all the purposes of both the IT07 and the applicable DTA, notwithstanding anything in New Zealand's DTAs. The tax consequences of that deemed PE are then determined by the other provisions of the Act and the DTA. For example, New Zealand will have a right to tax the profits attributable

Mr Smith visited New Zealand 3 times. On his first visit he stayed for 103 days from 2 April 2021 to 13 July 2021. He visited New Zealand again for 40 days from 1 October 2021 to 9 November 2021.
