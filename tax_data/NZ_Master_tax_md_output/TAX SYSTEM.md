In a case concerning the meaning of the phrase "a group of companies" as defined in s 191(3) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now s IC 6), the Court of Appeal held that the arguments advanced by the Commissioner did not provide a sufficient basis for departing from the plain meaning of the words. After reviewing the principles of statutory interpretation, the Court of Appeal found it fundamental to all statutory interpretation that words be given their ordinary meaning. Where words can have more than one meaning and the object of the legislation is clear, then the words must be given "such fair, large and liberal construction" as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act. Where the words are unclear, or are reasonably capable of more than one meaning, the court prefers an interpretation that does not lead to injustice or absurdity, and one that accords with the evident purpose. The true meaning must be consonant with the words used, having regard to their context in the Act as a whole, and to the purpose of the legislation to the extent that this is

Those cases give a good indication of how a section applies in relation to a particular problem. For example, there are many cases on the general permission and general limitations sections found in ss DA 1–DA 3 of the IT07 and the general anti-avoidance sections.

A person took the view that tax at the appropriate rate should be imposed on each item of income separately.

For economic and policy reasons, the Government, from time to time, encourages or assists various types of taxpayers or business activities by granting incentive deductions.

For example, a taxpayer in business is allowed a deduction for certain

Information is critical to IR's ability to deliver services. Much of that information is provided by taxpayers. This may be information about themselves (such as in an individual or business income tax return) or about other taxpayers (such as employee income information). For taxpayers to be comfortable providing their information, they need to feel the information requested is reasonable and is treated appropriately by IR. This assurance is given by the confidentiality
