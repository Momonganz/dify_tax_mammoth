Deductions are a component of the calculation of taxable income. If a person's annual total deductions for a tax year exceed the annual gross income, the difference is a net loss for the year (and net income for the year if income exceeds deductions): s BC 4. From net income, a deduction is made for any available tax loss to arrive at taxable income for the tax

This is the rule that no deduction is allowed for an expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a capital nature.

In the course of takeover activities, legal expenses were incurred in defending the allotment of shares in the target company in favour of the taxpayer. The expenses were of a capital nature and so not allowed as a deduction. The Court explained that one principle that applies under provisions like those of the general permission is that: "to make a payment to acquire or to defend the acquisition of a favourable position from which to earn income or to enter into arrangements that will yield income is not in general an outlay incurred either in gaining or in carrying on business for the purpose of gaining assessable income; such a payment in the case of a trading company, occurs at a stage too remote from the receipt of income to be so regarded.

BP Australia produced petroleum products for sale to retailers operating through service stations, and developments in the market led to BP Australia and its competitors making trade tie payments to service station operators. The Privy Council summarised the objectives of BP Australia as follows: "The advantage which BP sought was to promote sales and obtain orders for petrol by up-to-date marketing methods, the only methods which could now prevail. Since orders were now and would in future be only obtainable from tied retailers, it must obtain ties with retailers. Its real object, however, was not the tie but the orders which would flow from the tie. To obtain ties it had to satisfy the appetite of the retailers by paying out sums for a period of years, whose amount was dependent on the estimated value of the retailer as a customer and the length of the period. The payment of such sums became part of the regular conduct of the business. It became one of the current necessities of the trade". The trade tie payments were

A company resolved to pay directors' fees, being the greater of the fees of the prior year or the profits for the present year. The directors, though, could elect to accept a lesser sum. It was held that the directors' fees were deductible in the income year the resolution was passed.

The Court held that the company was definitely committed to payment of the fees.

A very large body of case law has developed under the topic of whether an outgoing is of a capital nature. The distinction between capital expenditure and revenue expenditure centres on the difference between the structure of a business (capital) and the regular conduct of the business (revenue). An expense that intends to produce an enduring benefit for the business is

This distinction between structure and process was clearly explained in

The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure, or organisation set up or

To forestall a potential competitor entering the market, it agreed to pay £86,500 to purchase a shareholding interest in the competitor, to receive a non-competition covenant with a term of 3 years and to have ability to use some plant. The taxpayer supported deductibility of the payment on the ground that it was incurred for the purpose of earning more profit. The High Court of Australia rejected this view and held that the payment was capital expenditure and, as such, not allowed as a deduction. Dixon J explained the capital/revenue distinction

She decides to rent out the second bedroom through a peer-topeer platform to make some extra money. When she rents out the room, the guests are also able to use some common areas in the villa – the lounge, dining room, kitchen, laundry, and main bathroom. Hayley rented out the room for 120 nights during the year. The floor areas of

A break fee is the fee charged by a lender to a borrower to allow the borrower to repay a fixed interest rate loan earlier than the agreed

repayment date or to vary the fixed interest rate under the loan. A break fee is generally charged as compensation for the loss a lender, usually a bank, may have suffered if their current interest rate for a similar loan is lower than the fixed interest rate that applies to the borrower's loan. This situation arises where the lender has borrowed money from the wholesale money markets at a fixed interest rate, usually with no option for early repayment. Therefore, the lender will have to on-lend the money to

another borrower, possibly at a lower interest rate. The cost of borrowing

Company G, a manufacturer of various cleaning products, is seeking to acquire the intellectual property for an outdoor cleaning product produced by a competitor that is going out of business, along with any remaining stock of that product. After engaging a law firm to provide legal advice on the transaction, Company G makes an offer of $10 million for the intellectual property, including brand rights and the formulation or "recipe" for the product, and an additional $5 million for the remaining trading stock. However, Company G's offer is rejected as the manufacturer of the product receives a higher offer from a different competitor. Company G paid $33,000 for the legal fees.

A deduction for the legal fees is not available under s DB 62 (deduction for legal expenses) because the total amount of the expenditure on legal fees in the income year exceeds $10,000. Company G considers that a fair and reasonable allocation approach would result in a deduction of $11,000 (33% of the $33,000 it paid on legal fees related to the transaction) under s DB 66.

The interpretation statement also addresses the situation in which a journey undertaken for business purposes that includes a deviation of no significant distance for a private reason would be classified as business travel. The comment is made that any additional distance travelled for a private reason in the course of a journey undertaken for business purposes must be insignificant in comparison with the total journey. As a guideline, the statement says that private travel that represents the lesser of approximately 2 km or approximately

To illustrate this view, the statement gives the following example:

A self-employed plumber whose home is his base of operations goes to the gym on his way home at the end of the day. The stop at the gym involves the taxpayer travelling an alternative route from the last job of the day to the home work base, which adds 1 km to the journey. The total journey is 17 km. The travel to the gym

The statement also recognises that in some cases travel involving an intermediate stop between 2 points could be 2 journeys rather than

incidental to the entire journey: a taxpayer who travels to the office in order to carry out substantive business activities and then travels to another place for business purposes, would undertake 2 journeys.

On the assumption that travel between the taxpayer's home and

The definition of new build land is sufficiently wide enough to cover situations where hotel or motel units are converted to residential accommodation. As hotel and motel units are used for short-stay accommodation and often already have some cooking facilities and bathrooms, less work may be required to convert them into places suitable for long-term accommodation compared to other conversions (for example, conversions of commercial office blocks into apartments). As a result, a CCC may not be issued in these types of conversions. In such cases, the new build exemption applies from the date that the local authority or building consent authority records

Eight years later, Rip decides he wants to sell the land. Rip gets in touch with his local council to request a CCC for the new build. The council issues a CCC for the new build on 24 October 2029 but issues it subject to a B2.3.1 modification. On the CCC, the substantial completion date for the new build is recorded as being 24 October 2021, which is the date the durability of the building is counted from (instead of the date the CCC was issued). Since Rip's new build's CCC was issued subject to a B2.3.1 modification, the 20-year

The general rule against the deductibility or residential rental interest does not apply to build-to rent land. For build-to-rent dwellings that meet the asset class definition below, there is an in-perpetuity exclusion from the interest limitation rules. However, if the land fails to meet the definition at any point, the interest limitation rules apply, and interest is no longer able to be deducted in relation to that residential rental property, even if the requirements are met again at some point in time in the future.

For the exclusion to apply, the land must meet the following build-to-rent asset class

▪ tenants must be offered a fixed-term tenancy of at least 10 years with the ability to give 56 days' notice of termination but they may agree to or request other tenancy offers.

as they hold an asset and operate it as a build-to-rent development.

The exemption will apply to the extent that the land meets the definition.

Although the exclusion was introduced in March 2023, it is effective from 1 October 2021 when the interest limitation rules for residential rental property were enacted. Therefore, taxpayers who held existing build-to-rent assets had until 1 July 2023 to ensure that the asset met the relevant definition and to seek approval from Ministry of Housing and Urban Development. For new build-to-rent assets, the requirements must be met immediately and initial investors are able to deduct interest for as long

The policy is intended to apply to both new and existing build-to-rent developments. However, in reality, landlords are unlikely to have any existing developments that would have offered 10-year tenancies to all tenants. Therefore, existing build-to-rent assets had until 1 July 2023 to comply with the tenure and personalisation policy requirements included in the above definition of "build-to-rent land" and qualify for

Jack owns a rental property. Jack's tenant has just moved out. Although Jack advertised the property he is experiencing difficulty finding a new tenant. He concludes that the reason he cannot find a new tenant is that the property is too run down. Jack decides to tidy up the property to make it more attractive to potential tenants. The property is temporarily unavailable for rental while Jack arranges to have the property repaired, cleaned, and painted. Once this work has been done Jack will look for a new tenant. The expenditure that Jack incurs will have a sufficient nexus to Jack deriving assessable income from his rental

Tina owned a residential rental property for several years. Two years ago she decided to move into the house and use it as her home. This year she has undertaken repairs on the property and had it fully repainted. Tina seeks to claim a deduction for the cost of the repairs to her house on the basis they related to damage sustained when the house was tenanted. However, the repair costs are not deductible because the rental activity has ceased and the house is no longer being used to derive assessable income. At the time the expenditure was incurred it did not have the necessary nexus to Tina's assessable income.

Identification of the relevant asset is important in order to measure the extent of the work undertaken to the particular asset and, therefore, whether the work undertaken is revenue or capital in nature.

Taxpayers were previously allowed immediate tax deductions for R&D expenditure incurred only up until the point that an intangible asset was recognised under the accounting rules. Any further development expenditure incurred had to be capitalised. In the event that the R&D project did not create an asset that was depreciable for tax purposes, any development expenditure incurred post-recognition of an intangible asset for accounting purposes was generally non-deductible for tax purposes.

Changes made reduce distortions against investment in R&D caused by the previous tax rules by allowing capitalised development expenditure to either be deducted over time as depreciation (where the R&D results in a depreciable intangible asset — see [¶13-440](#page--1-64)) or deducted upon the intangible asset being written off for accounting purposes (where the R&D does not result in a depreciable intangible asset).

The Commissioner no longer considers that a companion's travel expenses would be deductible where the companion is travelling with the taxpayer because of ill-health.

A taxpayer was originally a national of another country, "Redland", but in 1966 he emigrated with his family to New Zealand. The exchange control laws of Redland prohibited the export of capital and so the taxpayer was forced to leave behind his capital of almost $500,000 in various investments. Management of the investments was left in the hands of an accountant but, by 1974, it had become evident to the taxpayer that the accountant was managing matters to his own personal advantage by making loans on very favourable terms to his relatives. Accordingly, in 1974 the taxpayer went back to Redland and spent 6 weeks restructuring his affairs to enable him to assume full control of management of the investments. Further visits were made in 1975 and 1976 in pursuit of that object. The authority held that the taxpayer was able to claim a deduction for the travelling expenses incurred on each of the 3 trips back to Redland. After noting that there was a steady increase in the taxpayer's income from his investments in the years 1973–1977, the authority found that although there was some consequential restructuring of capital assets, the taxpayer's main purpose in making the first trip was to increase the income to which he was entitled and which could be sent out to him in New Zealand. The other trips undertaken were in furtherance of that

A taxpayer claimed a deduction for vehicle expenses and depreciation incurred in the course of visiting farms and a beach property owned by companies in which the taxpayer had an interest. The deduction was disallowed on the ground that the expenditure was of a private or domestic nature. The Taxation Review Authority affirmed the Commissioner's assessments and held that the dominant purpose of the visits was not to earn assessable income. The taxpayer was merely protecting his capital investment; therefore, the necessary relationship between the visits and the gaining or producing of assessable income had not been
