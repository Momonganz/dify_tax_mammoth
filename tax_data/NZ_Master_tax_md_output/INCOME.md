The most significant class of non-income receipts are those of a capital nature. Accordingly, accretions to capital or capital receipts are not normally brought into the tax net, unless specific provision is made under the Act.

(1919). In that case, income was seen as the fruit or produce (eg dividends, rents or royalties) derived from an enduring source such as land or other property (or a taxpayer's ability to earn income from

personal exertion). Thus, it would follow that the profitable sale of an asset, "the tree", without more, would produce not income but a gain of a capital nature. That proposition has been applied by the courts, so that the proceeds of a mere realisation of a capital asset or a change of investment are not regarded as producing income gains.

Richardson J stated that "business profits are derived when and to the extent that gains are made from trading irrespective of the form those gains take. On sale of trading stock, a debt arises in favour of the vendor. The stock leaves his account and prima facie the debt for which it was exchanged should be brought into account in its place. It is implicit in the legislation that trading debts cannot be ignored in the calculation of business profits and must be brought into

However, the Court of Appeal did recognise 2 exceptions in which the accrual method might not be appropriate. The first exception is when the trader is providing longterm financial accommodation rather than ordinary commercial credit, ie a trader engaged in moneylending, with the implication that credit instalments should be returned on a receipts basis. The second exception is when the nature of the trader's business may be such that it would be unwise to adopt the accrual method (this would be when it would not be prudent for the trader to follow the accrual method

Some commentators have suggested that, because the relevant wording in DTAs requires only a "presence" in New Zealand (rather than a physical presence), an employee who is "virtually present" in New Zealand should be taxed in New Zealand. The better view may be that an employee must be physically present in New Zealand to be taxed in New Zealand. The idea of a "virtual presence" being sufficient runs against a basic cornerstone of taxing the derivation of income — namely, it is taxed where the physical effort takes place.

One of the first steps in determining a person's income tax liability for the income year is to ascertain the person's income. Whether an amount derived by a person is income is determined from case law (see [¶5-021](#page-2-0) and [¶5-031](#page-5-0)) and Pt C of the IT07 (see [¶5-162)](#page-49-1).

A taxpayer acquired a property in the expectation that an adjacent property could later be acquired and both properties then transferred to a related company for integration into a development project being carried on by that related company. In these circumstances, the taxpayer's dominant purpose was the sale of the property. In coming to this view, the court accepted the notion that a conditional purpose may amount to a dominant purpose. If a person buys a piece of land because he or she

The Commissioner also seems to accept that shares can be changed from time to time as part of an investment policy by a person and that shares can be purchased with more than one purpose in mind, the dominant purpose being the relevant purpose. An example of this view is reflected in rulings concerning capital gains on shares earned by passive-index funds that simply track a share market index rather than make active

**Example:**

On 1 April 2013, a tenant receives a lease inducement payment of $100,000 from its landlord to enter into a 12-year lease. The terms and conditions of the agreement require that the tenant must use the payment for a fit-out of their lease premises.

The tenant spends a total of $300,000 on its fit-out in the 2013–14 income year. The

The tenant can either choose to return $100,000 as income over the next 10 years, starting from the 2013–14 income year (under s CG 8), or reduce the cost base of the fit-out by $100,000 (under s DB 64). Under the latter option, the tenant is only able to claim depreciation on the remaining $200,000 of expenditure incurred on the fit-out.

The landlord is allowed a deduction of $100,000 under s DB 20B, which is allocated under s EI 4B over the 12-year period from the 2013–14 to the 2024–25 income years inclusive (ie a deduction of $8,333 is allocated to the landlord in each income year).

Under the definition, most forms of interest are income unless specifically exempted. Interest received from a bank, finance company, building society, solicitors' mortgagee company or a

company on a debenture note, for example, is included in assessable income. The Commissioner also assesses a sum received upon early repayment of a mortgage on the footing that it is a lump sum in lieu of future interest. Also treated as interest is the value of any ballot prize arising from building society bonus balloting shares. Should the prize winner take the prize in the form of a mortgage loan, the cash equivalent is taken as the amount to be included in the recipient's income. If the prize is taken as cash, the income is allocated to the day on which the prize-winning bonus ballot is held. If the prize is

taken as an advance, the income is allocated to the day on which the advance is made. If the advance is made in a series of advances, the

income is allocated to the first day on which an advance is made.

A New Zealand law firm undertook work for a number of overseas clients. Payment for the work was credited to the firm's New Zealand bank account. The taxpayer claimed an export incentive for "qualifying services" (pursuant to the former provision in s 158 of the Income Tax Act 1976) on the basis that the payments were received for the supply of "knowhow". The issue that had to be decided was whether the payments made by the overseas clients were for the supply of knowhow or for a service. The court held that technical knowledge and information encompassed the supply of professional legal services. Consequently, because the services were provided by the taxpayer to a non-resident outside New Zealand, the work was performed in New Zealand and payment was in New Zealand currency, the legal services provided by the

Although Robert is treated as tax resident in New Zealand from 1 February 2011 (because of the back-dating rule in s YD 1(4)), he did not meet the requirements of either s YD 1(2) or (3) (ignoring the back-dating rule) for being a resident until 15 May 2011, when he moved here and acquired a permanent place of abode here.
