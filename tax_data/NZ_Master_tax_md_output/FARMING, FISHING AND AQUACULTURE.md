**Deemed registration**

R11 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,062.

A GST-registered husband and wife partnership operated its farming activity on 2 blocks of land each owned separately by a partner. The partnership later purchased the land from the partners and claimed an input tax deduction. The partners did not account for GST, being unregistered vendors. Although the partnership agreement did not make it clear whether the land was intended to be a partnership asset, the land was used by the partnership, it was recorded in the accounts and the partnership claimed income tax deductions on rates and interest paid in respect of the land. The Commissioner argued that s 57(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 deemed the sale of the land by the husband and wife to the partnership to be a supply made by the partnership and not the individual partners. If this approach were accepted the GST outcome would be neutral (output tax would equal the input tax deduction). However, this approach was rejected by the Taxation Review Authority. See

The purchase of broodmares in-foal raises 2 options for determining cost price due to a long gestation period that may straddle balance date.

This is on the
