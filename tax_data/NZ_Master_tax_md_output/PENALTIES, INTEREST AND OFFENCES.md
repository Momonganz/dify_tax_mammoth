exception is the employers' withholding payment penalty. See ss 94A(2) and 141ED. It is not necessary for unpaid tax to have been

assessed, become assessable or payable, or been paid before a shortfall penalty is assessed. An assessment of a shortfall penalty

that is made before the enactment of the annual taxing Act is

calculated at the tax rates that applied for the previous income year.

It is the Commissioner's view that, provided there is a "tax shortfall" (see [¶14-100](#page-25-0)), the time bar provisions (see [¶4-110)](#page--1-0) do not apply to an assessment for a shortfall penalty. Section 94A does not import the statute bar provisions (ss 108 and 108A) into the assessment of shortfall penalties. The Commissioner is not time barred from issuing an assessment for a shortfall penalty or from amending assessments of shortfall penalties, providing there is a "tax shortfall" in existence
