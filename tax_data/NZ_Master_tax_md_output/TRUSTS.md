The following example demonstrates the application of the ordering

A trustee of a non-complying trust wishes to distribute $60 each to beneficiary A and beneficiary B on 24 December. The trustee has derived only $100 of income in the current income year. However, the trustee derived $20 of income two years earlier that has not yet been treated under s HC 16 as being included in a distribution. Given that the distributions are contemporaneous, the trustee can effectively decide how

The trustee can treat the distribution to beneficiary A as including $60 of current year income and the distribution to beneficiary B as including $40 of current year income and $20 of previous year income. As a result, beneficiary A will have beneficiary income of $60 and beneficiary B will have beneficiary income of $40 and a taxable distribution of $20. The $20 is a taxable distribution and not beneficiary income

because, by definition, beneficiary income must be distributed in the income year it is derived by the trustee (or by the date after the end of the income year referred to in s HC 6(1B)). The beneficiary income is taxed at the beneficiaries' marginal tax rates,

If a trust has tax losses, confusion can arise about the timing of the

A trust has tax losses but current-year accounting profits. If losses were offset against current-year income before the allocation between trustee and beneficiary income, there would be no income available to distribute to the beneficiaries. The trust deed should be referred to in the first instance to see whether it provides how losses shall be allocated between income and capital. If there is any current-year income in which the beneficiaries have a vested interest or that has been "paid" in terms of the income tax legislation, it seems that it is only the balance that is "trustee income". It is at this point that any prior year losses are offset. Beneficiary income and trustee income are defined in ss HC 6 and HC 7 by reference to income derived, and under the core provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007, losses are offset after net income is

determined. See [¶1-380.](#page--1-23) This order would mean the loss offset would apply after
