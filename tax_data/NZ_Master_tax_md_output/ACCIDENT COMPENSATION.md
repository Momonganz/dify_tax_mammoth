Before the 2016–17 year, ACC levies also comprised a residual portion relating to funding claims for both work-related and nonwork-related injuries incurred before 1 July 1999. Before 1999, a "pay-as-you-go" funding approach was taken. This meant that the levies paid each year covered only the claim costs expected in that

year — they did not cover the ongoing costs of claims made in previous years. The final amount needed to fund these pre-1999

Overpayments of more than $20 are refunded by the ACC. Further, if an overpayment is more than $1,000, the ACC must pay interest on the refund.

Employers and self-employed persons receive only one invoice from the ACC for all levies and only one payment is required per year.

employed persons directly as part of its annual invoicing cycle.

An employer or a private domestic worker is not liable to pay an amount of work account levy if the invoice amount for the levy is less than $20. Similarly, a self-employed person is not liable to pay an amount of work account levy if the invoice amount for the levy is less than $40. In addition, no penalties will be payable for the nonpayment of the work account levy invoiced within these thresholds.

Arrangements may be made with ACC to pay the work account levy by instalments. However, interest is payable if levies remain unpaid on the day after the due date for payment, and penalties may apply if the full amount is not paid within a further 6 months. Before 1 July
