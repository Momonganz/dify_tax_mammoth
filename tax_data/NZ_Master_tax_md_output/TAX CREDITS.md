Once a person has determined their income tax liability by applying the basic tax rate to their taxable income, that liability is satisfied by any available tax credits and then, finally, through the payment of terminal tax. In some cases, a person's tax credits may exceed their income tax liability for the tax year. In that case the composition of the surplus tax credits is determined as if those credits were set off

The amount of the credit is calculated as 33⅓% of the total gifts made in a tax year. The total amount of qualifying donations made in a tax year must not exceed the person's taxable income for that year. The total amount refunded must be no more than the annual amount of the tax credits. No credit can be claimed if a taxpayer's taxable income is reduced to nil by utilising available net losses.

The court held that the forgiveness of debt to the trust met the definition of "gift". The gifts were for an amount of more than $5 each year. A "monetary gift of $5 or more" did not require a cash payment. This decision was inconsistent with the policy intent and, as a result, the definition was retrospectively amended to ensure

Repayment of cashed-out losses will occur when a taxpayer pays tax on taxable income that would have been sheltered by the cashed-out losses if they had been carried forward. However, if the company or shareholders make an untaxed return on their investment before having repaid the value of the cashed-out loss, this would lead to a concessionary outcome for the taxpayer unless it triggered the repayment of some cashed-out losses.

In the 2017–18 year the company enters a manufacturing phase, selling trading stock to earn net income of $150,000. It has taxable income of $100,000 and pays income tax of $28,000. In the 2018–19 income year it sells know-how for $250,000 (which is a capital receipt) and also has taxable income of $80,000. The sale triggers a repayment event, because the receipt from the sale of the know-how was not assessable income for Taylortronics.
