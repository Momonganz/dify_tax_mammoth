The third calculation method under s RL 4(6) is only available when the vendor or vendor's conveyancer is the person who must pay the RLWT. The amount is the greater of zero and the amount calculated as follows:

current purchase price − security discharge amount − outstanding rates

**security discharge amount** is the total of the amounts required by licensed security holders to discharge their mortgages or other

**outstanding rates** is the amount of local authority rates outstanding.

**licensed security holder** means a New Zealand registered bank or a licensed non-bank deposit taker (as defined in s 4 of the Non-bank Deposit Takers Act 2013) holding a mortgage or other security over

If land is bought with the intention of retaining some and selling a part (eg to finance the purchase), the sale of the part gives rise to a taxable situation. For this rule to apply, it appears that the purpose or intention of resale must be definitive in some way, ie the purpose or intention of selling the land must exist at the time the land was acquired. However, the purpose or intention of selling does not have to be the dominant purpose or intention for acquiring the land for the profit to be taxable.

In the course of finding that the gain on sale was not income, the Taxation Review Authority remarked that the fact that, at the time of purchase, the taxpayer also had it in mind that one day the property might increase in value, and that some of that increase might be available to him in his old age, did not thereby convert the purchase into being one for the purposes of resale. The possibility of an increase in value of residential real estate over a period of years is a commonplace

It is the person's purpose or intention at the time of acquisition that is material, ie the person must have reached a decision to sell the land, or a part or interest in the land, at the time of acquisition.

In this case, despite the fact that certain partners took steps that appeared to demonstrate an intention or purpose of disposal the High Court concluded that "the evidence establishes a tolerably clear picture of these 4 taxpayers as users of the property they had freeholded to best advantage, rather than being a partnership that acquired the land with a purpose or intention of disposing of it, whether that was a single

On 1 August 2018, Raj, a dentist, purchases a property with a villa on it. The previous owner had lived in the villa for many years. Raj fits the villa out as a dentist surgery and carries on his dentistry business from there. Three years later, Raj sells his dentistry practice and the villa and moves overseas. During the time Raj owned the villa, nobody lived in it, and Raj did not have an arrangement to erect a dwelling on the property.

Shortly after selling the villa, Raj hears about the bright-line test and asks his lawyer, Ruby, whether the sale might be subject to tax since the villa was previously a residential home. Ruby explains that the sale of the villa is not subject to the bright-line test because the

It is to be noted that it must be a business of dealing. "Dealing" connotes buying and selling or exchanging land. To constitute a business of dealing where a person does not hold himself out as carrying on such business, generally speaking, the law requires a reasonable frequency of transactions or some continuity of effort in respect of the buying, selling or exchanging of land. Even where there are a number of transactions concerning land, they may well have some other explanation. The sales and purchases may be entirely for personal reasons. They may constitute a form of

investment or change of investment with the object of getting a

return from the property in preference to other forms of investment of money. It is a question of fact or inference from fact in each case. Sometimes it is difficult to draw the dividing line, and other times it is clear that the case falls on one side or the other. Each case must

**Example: Residential and main home exclusions**

Mr and Mrs A occupy all of the properties together as their residence. As a trustee of Trust A, Mrs A has significant involvement in, or control of, Trust A. As a trustee of Trust B, Mr A has significant involvement in, or control of, Trust B. Because Mr and Mrs A occupy all of the properties and have significant involvement in, or control of, the trusts that own 2 of the properties, Mr and Mrs A, Trust A and Trust B will be treated as a group of persons who undertake buying and selling activities together. Because those buying and selling activities form a regular pattern (as the properties are bought and sold at regular intervals), they will be subject to the regular pattern restriction (assuming all the properties were acquired with an intention of resale (see below)). Example taken from the Commentary to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21,

For the residential exclusion, the regular pattern restriction

Finally, the amendments have clarified that the regular pattern

William would have qualified for the main home exclusion in s CZ 40 if the land had been acquired before 27 March 2021 because for most of the bright-line period (ie more than 50%), the house was used as William's main home. As a result, s CZ 39 would not apply and William would have no tax to pay (though other aspects of the land sale rules, including the intention test, would still need to be considered).

However, because the land was purchased in 2023, the relevant main home exclusion is in s CB 16A. This exclusion will not apply as the land was not William's main home for the full bright-line period. Instead, William will be subject to tax under s CB 6A, but his income will be reduced to reflect the period for which the property was used

as his main home (see the adjustment calculation discussion below).

Main home test where construction takes more than 12 months

The 12-month buffer provision was rewritten by the March 2022 amendments to cover situations where a main home was under construction and takes longer than 12 months to complete. Under the previous wording of s CB 16A, land on which a main home was constructed would be taxed for some of the ownership period if the

construction took longer than 12 months. The buffer period now covers the entire period that a main home is under construction,

As a result of concerns that the regular pattern restrictions were not working as intended, amendments were made with effect from 30 March 2021. Previously, taxpayers who habitually bought and sold land could structure around the regular pattern restrictions by using associated persons to carry out separate transactions, or by varying each transaction so that there was no "pattern". Amendments were therefore made to the regular pattern restrictions in the residential (see [¶7-211](#page-105-0)), main home (see [¶7-215](#page-110-0) and [¶7-220](#page-124-0)) and business

The amendments have expanded the regular pattern restriction to apply to a group of persons undertaking buying and selling activities

together, rather than just the activities of a single person. For the purposes of the business premises exclusion, a group of persons is treated as undertaking buying and selling activities together where:

Companies A, B, C and D all occupy their land as business premises mainly to carry on a substantial business. (It does not matter whether the businesses are related.) The same persons have significant involvement in, or control of, the activities of all of the companies (for example, all the companies have the same shareholders). Therefore, companies A, B, C and D form a group of persons who are treated as undertaking buying and selling activities together. Because those buying and selling activities form a regular pattern (the properties are sold at regular intervals), they will be subject to the regular pattern restriction (assuming all the properties were acquired with an

For the business premises exclusion, the regular pattern restriction previously applied when a person had engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of, or erecting and disposing of, premises used by the person for a substantial business. This was interpreted very narrowly to apply only when there was a similarity or likeness between the transactions. This was in contrast to the more general

The land must be capable of being worked as an economic unit, ie a farming or agricultural business at the time of sale. It is not sufficient that the land is capable of being developed into an economic unit. Any change or modification of a previous farm use will no doubt require expenditure of some time, effort and money, and there may be marginal cases where it is not easy to draw the line. However, the land must have the present capability.

Elena enters into an agreement to sell her property on 7 March 2028. The new build bright-line test applies, so Elena needs to consider whether the agreement to sell is within 5 years of her bright-line acquisition date.

In some instances, it may be appropriate to average costs over all of the land sold.

A taxpayer purchased land for market gardening, but later subdivided it into residential lots for resale to produce income from an undertaking or a scheme commenced within 10 years. To calculate the assessable profit, the taxpayer added the cost price of the land to the remaining estimated development costs and divided the resulting figure by the total number of sections. The taxpayer, therefore, obtained an average cost per section, and this was deducted from the amount received upon sale to give the net profit arising on the sale of each section. The Commissioner accepted this approach, and the Court of Appeal confirmed it. The Court also allowed
