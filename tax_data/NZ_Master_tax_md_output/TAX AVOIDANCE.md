The liability to pay the licence premium was discharged by the taxpayers issuing and delivering promissory notes. The notes would be met in cash in year 48 from harvest proceeds if enough proceeds existed at that time. The licence premium represented the cost of the right to use the

The taxpayers sought to persuade the Court that the licence premium expenditure was "incurred" when the promissory notes were executed: [117]. This was part of demonstrating that the licence premium was the relevant cost for depreciation

purposes. In terms of formal legal analysis, the wording of the deduction section and the case law surrounding it, the licence premium expense had been "incurred" and this was noted by the Court: see [118] and [119]. The general deduction provisions and depreciation provisions implicitly intend that the taxpayer is genuinely in business to make a profit and that the expenditure (or contractual obligation) will actually be discharged. With respect to each of these aspects the Court considered that the facts meant that those requirements in respect of the licence premium were not satisfied. On the evidence, it had been established that it was largely irrelevant to the taxpayers

The courts at all levels did not accept that there was any genuine prospect that the obligations would be met, or any need for them to be. Thus at [120] the court majority concluded that there was a strong evidential basis for concluding that the

While the expenditure had been legally "incurred", because of the 48-year mismatch between the point it was incurred and the point in time at which it had to be paid in cash from harvest proceeds, there was no cost in an economic sense. This distortion in timing is described by the Court at [130] as being inconsistent with the

example, the licence premium. In short, the Supreme Court majority held, applying s BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, that a 48-year promissory note which was (on all of the evidence) not likely ever to be satisfied in cash, did not meet the meaning of

**¶33-170 Tax avoidance — diverting income**

The most common method of "tax planning" is to divert income from

a taxpayer who bears tax at high rates to one who is taxed at low rates. Diversion of income may be achieved in one of 2 ways —

either by the transfer of income-producing assets (see [¶33-180)](#page-63-0) or by the alienation of income itself or the transfer of the right to future income. Because the diversion or alienation of income is often one of

the simplest and most effective forms of tax planning, it has been the subject of more decided cases in New Zealand than any other single tax-planning device. The general trend in judicial outcomes is in favour of the Commissioner, which indicates that any tax planning

In March 2018, the Commissioner issued a Revenue Alert, [RA 18/01,](http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/revenue-alerts/revenue-alert-ra1801.html)

Commissioner's view is that where a person or persons sell shares in a company (the target) to another company (the acquirer) in which they have a significant ownership interest, s BG 1 or GB 1 can apply in a range of circumstances. For example, a sale can be subject to s BG 1 where the target has no retained earnings at the time of sale and where the purchase price is simply left owing to the vendors. A tax avoidance arrangement may also arise where a holding company structure is used to facilitate the exit of a shareholder or the merger of 2 companies. The alert also states the Commissioner would have

Munira is an IT consultant. She provides her services to clients through her family trust, of which she is a beneficiary. Munira is the sole provider of personal services. The trust is contracted to only one customer and no substantial business assets are owned by the trust. Munira is paid a salary by the trust of $62,000 during the 20X3– X4 tax year. The trust has also distributed income of $10,000 to Munira during the 20X3–X4 tax year and distributions to 2 other beneficiaries of the trust amount to $5,000 ($3,000 to Jack and $2,000 to Bob). The trust's net income for the 20X3–X4 tax year is $30,000 (after the deduction of Munira's salary and distributions made to beneficiaries).
