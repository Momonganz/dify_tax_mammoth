Legislators decided that the appropriate period is from the date the company became subject to the BCT to the date the loss is used, or the business continuity period ends. To give effect to this, s IB 2B has been inserted into the BCT rules and this provision amends the shareholder continuity test for the purposes of the BCT ensuring it works correctly once there has been an initial shareholding breach.

The taxpayer company derived its income from interest and consulting fees. It claimed a tax credit for $1,004 in tax paid in Australia on interest earned.

The High Court held that by grouping losses against its assessable income, the taxpayer had arranged its affairs so that there was no New Zealand tax payable in respect of income earned on the Australian investment. Had the taxpayer chosen not to group losses equal to the income earned, there would have been room for the credit. However, because the taxpayer's taxable income was nil, no tax was payable in respect of the Australian income. Therefore, the credit to which the taxpayer was

The rules on the grouping of tax losses are designed to restrict the

In November 20X1, Lender Co lends $2 million to Borrower Co, a company in which Lender Co owns 67% of the shares. Borrower Co uses the money in a high-risk business venture. The venture fails. Borrower Co makes a business loss of $3 million from the investment for the 20X1–X2 income year. In March 20X2, Lender Co decides to write off the $2 million debt owing as bad. Lender Co satisfies the criteria for a bad debt deduction in s DB 31. Section IC 12 prohibits Lender Co (or any other company in the same group) from utilising the net loss of Borrower Co to the extent that the net loss equals or is less than the bad debt deduction obtained. Therefore, Lender Co will be entitled to utilise $1 million of the net loss of Borrower Co (ie loss of $3 million

Accordingly, C Ltd devalues its shares in K Ltd to $0 and claims a deduction for this under s DB 49 in its 20X1–X2 income tax return which shows a net profit for the year

C Ltd cannot utilise K Ltd's net loss because, although both companies are group companies, the loss of $370,000 does not exceed the deduction claimed for the share loss of $400,000. Thus the requirements of s IC 12 are not satisfied. The $370,000
