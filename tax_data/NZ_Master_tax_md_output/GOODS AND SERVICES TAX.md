These services are supplied in connection with specific land in New Zealand and are intended to assist or enable a change in the ownership status or physical condition of that land. These supplies are therefore charged with GST at 15%.

Even if Cynthia's tender had not been accepted by the vendor, the legal and valuation services relating to the Coromandel property would, on an objective assessment of Cynthia's intention in respect to the Coromandel property, still be charged with GST at 15% because they are intended to assist a change in the ownership status of the land. Similarly, if Cynthia had decided not to proceed with constructing a building on the site after the plans were drawn up, the architectural services would still be

Bary's Brownies and Liquorice Rolls Ltd (BBLR Ltd) sells confectionaries in its 35 stores throughout New Zealand. Its GST returns are filed on a 2-monthly basis. BBLR Ltd realises it made an error in its GST return for the period ending 30 September 2019 when one of the stores sends additional information about its sales to the head office in early November 2019. The amount of sales not recorded in the GST return was $8,000. This resulted in an understatement of the business's taxable supplies of $8,000 and a tax discrepancy in the assessment of $1,200 (that is, $8,000 × 15%).

BBLR Ltd cannot rely on s 113A(1) to correct the error in the GST return for the period ending 30 November 2019. This is because the tax discrepancy caused by the error is more than $1,000.

Exported goods are zero rated, so that an exporter may not collect GST on goods sold to an overseas customer. However, if the exporter has purchased materials in New Zealand that were subject to GST, he or she will be entitled to recover the amounts of GST paid from IR. Having paid GST on the purchase of materials without having collected GST from its customer, the exporter will be in a net credit situation with IR. It would appear to be to the exporter's advantage to recover the GST component of its business purchases from IR as soon as possible after the payment to its supplier.

Matters) Act 2022 repealed the sections of the GST Act which deal with tax invoices and replaced it with records of supply and supply information. The supply information rules apply from 1 April 2023.

See [¶32-151.](#page-161-0) "Invoice" is still a defined term and means a document

The time of supply for GST purposes can be triggered by the issuing of an invoice. See s 9(1). There has always been some question as

to whether a sale and purchase agreement itself constitutes an "invoice" for the purposes of s 9(1) and therefore can trigger the time of supply. An invoice is defined as "a document notifying an obligation to make payment". See s 2(1) of the GST Act. This is different to a "tax invoice", which is also a defined term in s 2(1).

At the time of purchase, she identifies herself as a GST-registered person and therefore is not charged GST. She uses the phone 50% for her taxable project management services and 50% for

Under the reverse charge, Melissa is treated as making a taxable supply to herself of NZ$400 at the 15% rate. She must return output tax of NZ$60 (NZ$400 × 15%). However, Melissa can claim an input tax deduction for the portion of her total use of the phone that is for taxable purposes (50%). The amount of the input tax deduction is NZ$30 (NZ$60 of GST × 50%). Her net position in the relevant return (assuming no other supplies) is therefore an output tax liability of NZ$30 (NZ$60 output tax minus

The rules applying to transactions involving nominees are intended to provide certainty by adopting an "economic substance" approach.

Section 60B clarifies the GST treatment of transactions involving nominations when a contractual purchaser nominates another person (a nominee) to receive the goods or services from the

Prior to the amendments, the secondhand goods input tax credit was limited to the GST included in the original cost to John, which was zero – therefore Jasmine would have been unable to claim any secondhand goods input tax credit. This was despite GST

Following the amendments, Jasmine is able to claim a secondhand goods input credit based on the tax fraction (3/23rds) of the original cost to John. The input tax deduction

This result ensures that Jasmine receives the same input tax deduction (in total) overall that John would have received if, instead of selling the secondhand goods to Jasmine, he had applied the goods 100% in a taxable activity.

To help students moving to New Zealand, Ecological Education provides various pre-arrival services to the students while they are still overseas (for example, interpreting and translating services, assistance with immigration procedures and the completion of enrolment applications).

First, it is necessary to identify the supply by considering the true nature of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out by the supplier and the recipient in

To decide whether Ecological Education has made one composite supply or multiple separate supplies it is helpful to consider the true and substantive nature of what is supplied to the student from the recipient's (that is, the student's) perspective. From the student's point of view, the dominant supply is of education services. Considering the relationship between the elements supplied, the pre-arrival services are ancillary or incidental to the supply of education services. The pre-arrival services are not aims in themselves, but are a means of better enjoying the education services. Accordingly, there is a single composite supply of education services that is subject to GST at the

Andrew needs to obtain a mortgage of $250,000 to purchase land for the expansion of his manufacturing business. He approaches New Bank, because of its recent mortgage promotion. He gets his mortgage approved and, as part of the mortgage promotion, he receives a new tablet. If these were separate supplies, the mortgage would be an exempt supply of financial services under s 14(1)(a). The supply of the tablet would be

a taxable supply under s 8. Is the supply of the tablet subject to GST?

No. The tablet is an incidental part of a single composite, exempt supply of the mortgage, so is also exempt from GST. The true nature of the legal arrangement is a loan from New Bank to Andrew (secured by a mortgage over the land). The contract also includes a supply of goods from New Bank to Andrew. Therefore, New Bank supplies multiple elements to Andrew, namely a loan and a tablet. The question is whether these 2 elements are a single composite supply or multiple separate supplies.

As with Example 1, the nature of the supply has to be considered from the recipient's

Unlike Example 1, the supply of the tablet cannot be considered ancillary to the supply of financial services, because it does not facilitate, contribute to or enable the supply of the dominant part of the transaction (the mortgage). The supply of the tablet does not directly affect the supply of the mortgage in any material sense. However, the supply of the tablet is incidental, minor or peripheral to the dominant element of the supply. Andrew would not have entered into a mortgage simply to receive the tablet. Obtaining the tablet is not an aim in itself. Andrew's aim is to obtain a mortgage. Objectively, the supply of the tablet does not change or facilitate the dominant element, which is the mortgage. The supply of the tablet is also not sufficiently distinct from the supply of the mortgage to make it reasonable to sever and apportion the parts. It is the supply of the

mortgage that triggers the supply of the tablet. In this situation, there is a single composite, exempt supply of a mortgage. The supply of the tablet is an incidental or peripheral supply to the dominant supply of GST-exempt financial services. This means

**Example 3: Tablet available at reduced price as part of mortgage promotion**

As a variation to the facts of Example 2, Andrew still needs to obtain a mortgage to purchase land for the expansion of his manufacturing business. He approaches New Bank because of its recent mortgage promotion. New Bank's mortgage promotion is that for new borrowings in the range of what Andrew wants to borrow, it is offering customers the opportunity to purchase for $500 a new tablet valued at $1,500.

Andrew's mortgage is approved, and as part of the mortgage promotion, he takes up the opportunity to get a new tablet for $500. Is the supply of the tablet subject to GST?

mortgage. Obtaining the tablet was an aim in itself. While Andrew's primary aim was to obtain a mortgage, obtaining the new tablet was a separate objective. As in Example 2, the supply of the tablet does not change or facilitate the dominant element, which is the mortgage. However, in this case the supply of the tablet is sufficiently distinct from the supply of the mortgage to make it reasonable to sever and apportion the elements. The tablet was not part of the supply of the mortgage — it was separately pursued by

This is because Benedict is not paying anything for this distribution. Special value of supply rules apply to this transaction because the supply is an associated supply.

Special time of supply rules apply to this transaction because the supply is an associated supply.
