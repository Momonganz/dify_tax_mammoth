At its balance date of 31 March 2018, NZ Sub UK Branch has total borrowings from the wholesale markets of NZ$2b. NZ$1.5b has been lent to NZ Bank Ltd at 4% p.a., NZ$500m lent to a UK resident at 12% p.a. and there are no other assets. On 31 October 2018, the UK resident repays its loan and NZ Sub UK Branch uses the amount to repay the wholesale market lenders. On 31 January 2019, NZ Sub UK Branch pays interest of NZ$60m. NZ Sub UK Branch calculates the loan ratio in section YD 5(8) as NZ$1.5b ÷ NZ$2b = 0.75. NZ Sub UK Branch calculates the apportionment of income from interest in section YD 5(4) as: 0.75 x NZ$60m = NZ$45m. Therefore, NZ$45m of the interest payment on 31 January 2019 has a New Zealand source, so NZ Sub UK Branch pays AIL of $900,000 which is
