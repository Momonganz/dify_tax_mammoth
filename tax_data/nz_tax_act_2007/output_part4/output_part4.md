Mary owns a launch. During the course of an income year, she takes her family out on the launch, she lets her brother use the launch (paying the market rate of $200 per day) and she lets her friend use the launch (paying fuel costs only at the rate of $50 per day). All these uses are instances of private use. When Mary rents out the launch to non-associates at market rates, takes the launch to another port for rental to non-associates at $250 per day and then back again to the home port, or takes the launch to a boatyard for repair after damage was caused by a non-associate during a rental period, none of these instances is private use.

Company Y has 2 shareholders: Thomas, who has borrowed $200,000 to acquire a 50% interest in the company, and Brent, who has borrowed $10,000 to buy his 50% interest. Each has a share of the remaining net asset balance of $22,500. The formula is ($65,000 − $20,000) × 50% = $22,500. Since Thomas's debt value is greater than his share of the net asset balance, Thomas must apportion 11.25% of his total interest expenditure (sections DG 14 and DG 13(7)–(9)). The formula is 22,500/200,000. Since Brent's debt value is less than his share of the net asset balance, all Brent's interest expenditure must be apportioned (sections DG 14 and

David has a city apartment with a rateable value of $300,000. He rents out the apartment and also uses it privately. He receives market rate rental of $4,000 from non-associates, and $6,000 from associates. David's total allowable expenditure, under sections DG 7, DG 8, and DG 11, is $15,000. The income from associates is exempt under section CW 8B, and is ignored. David therefore has asset income of $4,000 and deductions of $15,000, giving rise to an excess of expenditure over income of $11,000. Since David's income from non-associates is less than 2% of the apartment's rateable value, the excess expenditure of $11,000 is denied as a deduction.
