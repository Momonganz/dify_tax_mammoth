Three years ago, NZ Sub A Ltd (A) borrowed NZ$1m from a non-resident associate (Foreign Lender Ltd). A's financial arrangement expenditure on this arrangement for each year has been $42,000, $50,000 and $53,000. For the same 3-year period, A has paid interest of $19,000, $20,000 and $21,000. At the end of the second year, the deferral calculation is ($19,000 + $20,000) ÷ $42,000 = 92.9%, so no NRFAI arises. However, at the end of the third year the deferral calculation is ($19,000 + $20,000 + $21,000) ÷ ($42,000 + $50,000) = 65.2%. As this is below 90%, NRFAI arises for the first time in the third year.

On 1 April 2010, X Ltd borrowed $1m from Foreign Parent Ltd, repayable on 31 March 2025. Foreign Parent also has a New Zealand branch. On 31 March each year from 2011 to 2016, X makes an interest payment of $60,000 to Foreign Parent. As Foreign Parent has a New Zealand branch, these interest payments are not non-resident passive income, so no NRWT is required to be withheld. Once the amendments to section RF 2(1)(d) are enacted, any interest payments by X to Foreign Parent will be non-resident passive income. On 30 September 2016, X makes a one-off interest payment of $400,000 and agrees with Foreign Parent that no further interest will be paid. X calculates that $35,000 of this payment covers the period from 1 April 2016 to the date on which the amendments to section RF 2(1)(d) are enacted. The remaining $365,000 is treated as a prepayment that is paid on the date of enactment, so X is required to withhold NRWT of $36,500.
