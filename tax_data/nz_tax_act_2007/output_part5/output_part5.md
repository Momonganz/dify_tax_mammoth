#### *When this section applies*

- (1) This section applies if, in an income year (the **current year**), a person (the **transferor**) disposes of livestock of a type for which they use the herd scheme (the **transfer**) to an associated person (the **transferee**), and the transfer is not in the ordinary course of business.
*When this section does not apply*

- (2) This section does not apply to the transfer of livestock if,—
	- (a) the transferor and the transferee would not be associated if the transferee or an associate were not the descendants in relation to the transferor or an associate of the transferor; and
	- (b) the transfer is at market value and the transfer's consideration is wholly on arm's length commercial terms and conditions, ignoring terms and conditions relating to financing; and

		- (i) all of their specified livestock in the income year of the transfer have been disposed of; and
		- (ii) they do not derive income from the disposal of specified livestock that are part of a farming business in the next 4 income years.

*When this section does not apply: deceased treated as alive and transferor*

- (3) This section does not apply if it would not apply treating a transfer of livestock to or from the estate of a deceased or under a will of a deceased as a transfer made by the deceased immediately before their death to the relevant transferee. However, this subsection does not apply if the will of the deceased creates a life interest in the relevant livestock.
*Compulsory use of herd scheme method*

- (4) Despite sections EC 7(2), EC 12(1), EC 22(1), and EC 25(1), the transferee is treated as choosing and giving a notice of election, with application beginning for the current year, to use the herd scheme for a type of livestock, if the formula in subsection (5) calculates zero or a positive amount for a class in the type of livestock.
*Formula*

- (5) The formula, for the purposes of subsections (1) and (4), is—
hypothetical end herd scheme amount − minimum herd scheme amount.

*Definition of items in formula*

## (6) In the formula,—

- (a) **hypothetical end herd scheme amount** is the lesser of the following 2 amounts, or the first amount if they are the same:
	- (i) the number of animals in the current year that the person would have of a class (the **relevant class**), adding back animals in all transfers described in subsection (1) that this section would apply to:
	- (ii) the number of animals of the relevant class that the person valued under the herd scheme at the end of the year before the current year:
- (b) **minimum herd scheme amount** is the number of animals of the rele‐ vant class that the person has in the current year.

*Definitions*

- (7) In this section,—
	- (a) **descendant** means the son, daughter, or grandchild of the transferor or of an associate of the transferor:
	- (b) **descended associate** means—
		- (i) an associate (the **associate**) of the transferor that would not be associated if the associate or another associate were not descend‐ ants in relation to the transferor or another associate of the trans‐ feror:
		- (ii) an associate (the **associate**) of the transferor that carries on a farming business separately from the transferor, and would not be associated if the associate or another associate were not relatives in relation to the transferor or another associate of the transferor.

Defined in this Act: amount, associated, class, descendant, descended associate, herd scheme, income year, notice

- (2) If the transfer occurs in the same tax year for both the transferor and transferee, then the transfer is treated as a disposal and acquisition at the value of the
relevant livestock under the herd scheme at the end of the transferor's corres‐ ponding income year.

*Different tax year*

- (3) If the transfer occurs in different tax years for the transferor and transferee, then subsection (4) or (5) applies.
*Different tax year: transferee earlier*

- (4) If the transferee acquires the relevant livestock in a tax year earlier than the tax year in which the transferor disposes of it, then the transfer is treated as a disposal and acquisition at the value of the relevant livestock under the herd scheme at the beginning of the transferor's corresponding income year.
*Different tax year: transferee later*

- (5) If the transferee acquires the relevant livestock in a tax year (the **later tax year**) later than the tax year in which the transferor disposes of it, then—
	- (a) the transfer is treated as a disposal and acquisition at the value of the relevant livestock under the herd scheme at the end of the transferor's corresponding income year:
	- (b) for the purposes of the transferee's opening value under section EC 16, the transferee is treated as owning and valuing the relevant livestock under the herd scheme on the last day of the transferee's income year corresponding to the tax year before the later tax year.

	- (b) has the livestock on hand at the start of the income year; and
	- (c) has not chosen to value the livestock by a different method for the income year.

### *Determining opening value*

- (3) The opening value of herd livestock in an income year is either its herd value for the income year or, if the person has adopted a herd value ratio, its herd value for the income year multiplied by its herd value ratio for the previous income year. This subsection overrides section DB 49(3) (Adjustment
for opening values of trading stock, livestock, and excepted financial arrange‐ ments).

Defined in this Act: herd livestock, herd scheme, herd value, herd value ratio, income year

Section EC 16(3): amended (with effect on 1 April 2008), on 29 August 2011 (applying for the 2008–09 and later income years), by [section 22(1)](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM3819616) of the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011 (2011 No 63).

## **EC 17 Herd value ratio**

*Adoption of herd value ratio*

- (1) A herd value ratio is available for a person to use in determining the value of specified livestock in the herd scheme. A person may adopt a herd value ratio for herd livestock of a particular type by giving notice in the way described in section EC 11. A person may also adopt a recalculated ratio by giving notice in the same way.
*Chatham Islands livestock*

- (2) Herd value ratios calculated under subsection (5) do not apply to livestock on the Chatham Islands. The Chatham Islands adjustment to the herd value ratio is dealt with in section EC 19.
*When herd value ratio applies*

- (3) When a person adopts a herd value ratio for livestock of a particular type, the ratio applies in the income year specified in the notice and in later income years until—
	- (a) the income year in which it is superseded by a recalculation of the ratio; or
	- (b) the income year in which the person stops valuing, under an election, livestock of that type under the herd scheme; or
	- (c) the income year following 2 consecutive income years in which the person has not valued livestock of that type under the herd scheme.

*Assessment of average value*

- (4) For the purpose of calculating a herd value ratio, a person must obtain from a recognised livestock valuer an assessment of the value of an average animal of that person in each applicable class of livestock. The value is determined as at the 30 April that is closest to the day on which the national average market values are set.
## *Calculation of herd value ratio*

- (5) The herd value ratio for livestock of a particular type is calculated by using the formula in subsection (6) and rounding the result of the calculation to the nearest of the following figures: 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.
*Formula*

- (6) The formula is—
∑(average value × number) ÷ ∑(herd value × number).

*Definition of items in formula*

## (7) In the formula,—

- (a) **Σ** is the total of the individual calculations for all applicable classes of livestock type valued under the herd scheme:
- (b) **average value** is the average value of an animal in a class as described in subsection (4):
- (c) **number** is the number of all livestock of that class on hand at the end of the income year, including livestock that are not in the herd scheme, but not including high-priced livestock:
- (d) **herd value** is the herd value of livestock for a class.

Defined in this Act: class, herd livestock, herd scheme, herd value, herd value ratio, high-priced livestock, income year, livestock on the Chatham Islands, national average market value, notice, specified livestock, type

Compare: 2004 No 35 s [EC 17](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM254216)

#### **EC 18 Inaccurate herd value ratio**

The Commissioner may require a person who is using an inaccurate herd value ratio for a type of livestock in an income year to recalculate the herd value ratio. If the recalculation differs from the existing ratio for the income year, the Commissioner may amend the assessment of income tax for the income year and any later income year and may substitute the recalculated herd value ratio for that previously applied by the person.

#### **EC 19 Chatham Islands adjustment to herd value**

*Adjustment for herd livestock on Chatham Islands*

- (1) A person may adopt an adjustment for herd livestock on the Chatham Islands by giving notice in the way described in section EC 11.
### *When adjustment applies*

- (2) When a person adopts a Chatham Islands adjustment as a herd value ratio, it applies as a herd value ratio to a particular type of livestock on the Chatham Islands at the end of the income year specified in the notice and in later income years until—
	- (a) the income year in which the person stops valuing, under an election, livestock of that type in the herd scheme; or
	- (b) the income year following 2 consecutive income years in which the person has not valued livestock of that type on the Chatham Islands under the herd scheme.

*Setting adjustment*

- (3) The Commissioner must set and may vary from time to time the level of Chatham Islands adjustment to the herd value ratio that applies in an income year.
*Secondary legislation*

- (4) The instrument that sets or varies an adjustment under subsection (3) is sec‐ ondary legislation (*see* [Part 3](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM7298343) of the Legislation Act 2019 for publication requirements).

# **EC 26 Bailee's treatment of livestock**

Version as at

*When this section applies*

- (1) This section applies when, under a bailment, lease, or other agreement,—
	- (a) a person (**person A**) has the use of specified livestock; and
	- (b) person A is required—
		- (i) to return the livestock to the person who made it available; or
		- (ii) to pay the person full compensation for it.

*Closing livestock numbers*

- (2) Person A is treated as owning, and must take into account at the end of an income year, the total number for all classes calculated using the formula—
total livestock − bailed livestock.

*Definition of items in formula*

- (3) In the formula,—
	- (a) **total livestock** is all the livestock that person A has on hand in a class at the end of the income year, including—
		- (i) the livestock that they own; and
		- (ii) the livestock that they have the use of under the bailment, lease, or other agreement:
	- (b) **bailed livestock** is all the livestock in a class that person A has been given the use of under a bailment, lease, or other agreement that remains in force at the end of the income year.

*Result of applying formula*

- (4) If the result of applying the formula in subsection (2) is positive, person A is treated as the owner of any surplus livestock. If the result is negative, person A must adjust the total number described in subsection (2) by treating it as a negative number.

## *Partnerships: cost price and national standard cost scheme*

Heading: inserted (with effect on 1 April 2009), on 6 October 2009, by [section 114(1)](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM2178469) of the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 (2009 No 34).

## **EC 26B Entering partners' cost base**

- (1) This section applies when an entering partner has acquired specified livestock that includes female breeding livestock for which section HG 10 (Disposal of livestock) applies, and the partners use the cost price method or the national standard cost scheme.
*Existing cost base*

- (2) For the specified livestock, the entering partner is treated as having the same existing cost base that the exiting partner would have had for the purposes of the cost price method or national standard cost scheme for an income year, if they had not disposed of the interests.
*Addition to cost base*

- (3) For the purposes of determining the value of the specified livestock at the end of an income year for the purposes of section EC 2, the entering partner must add to the existing cost base, described in subsection (2), the amount for the income year (the **current year**) calculated using the following formula:
livestock cost base difference × current year count ÷ allowed years.

- (4) In the formula,—
	- (a) **livestock cost base difference** is the cost base that the entering partner would have for the specified livestock at the end of the income year in which the acquisition of the specified livestock occurred, ignoring subsection (2) reduced by the entering partner's existing cost base for the specified livestock at the end of that year, described in subsection (2). It must be a positive number:
	- (b) **current year count**,—
		- (i) is the allowed years reduced by the number of years between the current year and the income year in which the entering partner's acquisition of the specified livestock occurred, ignoring years in which the partners do not use the cost price method or national standard cost scheme (for example: **current year count** is **1**, if the allowed years is **4**, and the acquisition of the specified livestock occurred in the 2010–11 income year, and the current year is the 2013–14 income year, and the relevant method or scheme was used for all relevant income years):
		- (ii) may equal the allowed years (for example: the current year is the same year as the income year in which the entering partner's acquisition of the specified livestock occurred), but must not be a negative number:
	- (c) **allowed years** is—
		- (i) 4, if the partners acquire or dispose of any partnership interests that include any livestock after the entering partner's acquisition of the specified livestock and before the end of the income year in which that acquisition occurred; or
		- (ii) 5, if the partners do not acquire or dispose of any partnership interests that include any livestock after the entering partner's

acquisition of the specified livestock and before the end of the income year in which that acquisition occurred.

### **EC 34 General rule**

*Value in income year of acquisition and later income years*

- (1) The closing value of high-priced livestock at the end of the income year in which it is acquired is its cost price minus the reduction applying in the income year. In a later income year, the value is its opening value minus the reduction applying in the income year until the value reaches or falls below the national average market value for the class to which the livestock belongs.
*Straight-line method*

- (2) When a person has chosen to use the straight-line method, the reduction is calculated using the formula—
cost price × depreciation percentage.

*Diminishing value method*

- (3) When a person has chosen to use the diminishing value method, the reduction is calculated as follows:
	- (a) in the first income year in which the election applies, the cost price multiplied by the diminishing value equivalent of the depreciation per‐ centage for the income year:
	- (b) in later income years, the opening value of the livestock multiplied by the diminishing value equivalent of the depreciation percentage for the income year.

#### *Meaning of diminishing value equivalent*

- (4) In this section, **diminishing value equivalent**, for a depreciation percentage, means the diminishing value depreciation rate in schedule 12, column 1 (Old banded rates of depreciation) to which the amount in column 2 equal to the depreciation percentage is the straight-line equivalent. Two qualifications are—
	- (a) if no amount in column 2 is equal to the depreciation percentage, the amount closest to it is taken; and
	- (b) if 2 amounts in column 2 are equidistant from the depreciation percent‐ age, the depreciation percentage is rounded down.

#### *Exclusions*

- (5) This section does not apply in the cases described in sections EC 35 and EC 36.
Defined in this Act: amount, class, cost price, depreciation percentage, diminishing value equivalent, high-priced livestock, income year, national average market value

#### **ED 1B Valuation of emissions units issued for zero price**

*What this section applies to*

- (1) This section applies to emissions units held by a person in an income year that—
	- (a) are transferred to the person at a price of zero—
		- (i) under [sections 80 to 86F](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM1662642) of the Climate Change Response Act 2002:
		- (ii) under [section 64](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM1662494) of the Climate Change Response Act 2002 for a removal activity listed in [Schedule 4](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM1662864), Part 2 of that Act:
		- (iii) by a public authority under a supplementary agreement to a nego‐ tiated greenhouse agreement:
- (iv) by a public authority as a rebate, under a negotiated greenhouse agreement, for an indirect emissions charge; and
- (b) have been held continuously by the person from the time of the transfer; and
- (c) have not been valued under either of subsections (4)(a) and (8)(a) before the income year; and
- (d) *[Repealed]*
- (e) *[Repealed]*
- (f) *[Repealed]*

*Value of units transferred to person if no earlier emissions unit shortfall year*

- (2) If an emissions unit is transferred to the person in the income year and there is no earlier income year that is an emissions unit shortfall year for the person under subsections (9) and (10), the emissions unit is assigned a value of zero at the time of the transfer.
## *Value of units transferred to person in income year after emissions unit shortfall year*

- (3) If an earlier income year is an emissions unit shortfall year for the person immediately before an emissions unit (the **transferred unit**) is transferred to the person in the income year, the value of the transferred unit at the time of the transfer is given by the application of the paragraphs in subsection (4) in alphabetical order to transferred units until all the transferred units are assigned a value.
## *Valuation method at transfer for transferred units*

- (4) If emissions units are transferred to the person in an income year when there is a unit shortfall under subsections (9) and (10) for an earlier emissions unit shortfall year,—
	- (a) for each emissions unit shortfall year in date order, transferred units, up to the number corresponding to the unit shortfall relating to the emis‐ sions unit shortfall year, are each assigned a value equal to the market value of an emissions unit at the end of the emissions unit shortfall year:
	- (b) transferred units are each assigned a value equal to zero.

*Value of units with zero value immediately before end of income year*

- (5) If the value of an emissions unit (the **revalued unit**) held by the person imme‐ diately before the end of the income year is zero, the value of the revalued unit at the end of the year is given by the application of the paragraphs in subsection (8) in alphabetical order to revalued units until all the revalued units are assigned a value.
### *Limit on application of subsection (8)(a)*

- (6) The maximum number of units valued under subsection (8)(a) for the income year is the greater of zero and the number calculated using the formula—
### unit entitlement − disposals at zero value.

*Definition of items in formula*

- (7) In the formula,—
	- (a) **unit entitlement** is the total for the income year of amounts, each of which the person would have for the period of overlap between a calendar year ending 31 December and the income year if the period of overlap were treated as a year, of—
		- (i) final allocation entitlement under [section 83](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM1662645) of the Climate Change Response Act 2002:
		- (ii) allocation entitlement under [section 85](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM1662647) of that Act:
		- (iii) allocation entitlement under [section 64](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM1662494) of the Climate Change Response Act 2002 for a removal activity listed in [Schedule 4](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM1662864), Part 2 of that Act:
		- (iv) emissions units corresponding to the actual emissions amount under a supplementary agreement to a negotiated greenhouse agreement:
		- (v) emissions units corresponding to a rebate, under a negotiated greenhouse agreement, for an indirect emissions charge:
	- (b) **disposals at zero value** is the number of emissions units disposed of by the person in the income year that had a value of zero at the disposal.

*Valuation method at end of income year for revalued units*

- (8) If the person holds revalued units immediately before the end of the income year, the units are each assigned a value—
	- (a) equal to the market value of an emissions unit at the end of the income year:
	- (b) equal to zero.

*Emissions unit shortfall year*

- (9) If the number of units assigned a market value for an income year under subsection (8)(a) is less than the maximum number given by subsection (6) for the income year, at the end of the income year—
	- (a) the income year is an **emissions unit shortfall year** and has 2 numbers (the **unit shortfall** and the **unit shortfall value**) associated with it:
	- (b) the unit shortfall relating to the emissions unit shortfall year is the difference between the maximum number given by subsection (6) for the income year and the number of zero value units assigned a market value under subsection (8)(a) for the income year:
	- (c) the unit shortfall value relating to the emissions unit shortfall year is the unit shortfall multiplied by the market value of an emissions unit at the end of the income year.

#### *Reductions in unit shortfall and unit shortfall value*

- (10) When an emissions unit held by a person is assigned a value under subsec‐ tion (4)(a) in relation to a year that is an emissions unit shortfall year for the person,—
	- (a) the unit shortfall relating to that year is reduced by the number of emissions units assigned a value in relation to that year:
	- (b) the unit shortfall value relating to that year is reduced by an amount equal to the number of emissions units assigned a value in relation to that year multiplied by the value assigned to each of those emissions units:
	- (c) the year ceases to be an emissions unit shortfall year, if the unit shortfall relating to the year is reduced to zero.

## *Unit shortfall values treated as values of additional emissions units for purposes of adjustments*

- (11) For the purposes of sections CH 1 and DB 49 (which relate to adjustments for values of excepted financial arrangements), the person is treated as holding at the end of the income year additional emissions units with a value equal to the total of the unit shortfall values relating to emissions unit shortfall years for the person.
Defined in this Act: amount, emissions unit, emissions unit shortfall year, fishing quota emissions units, forest land emissions units, income year, public authority, replacement forest land emissions units, year

### **ED 3 Part-year tax calculations for transfers: general insurance OCR**

- (1) This section applies when a person (the **transferor**) transfers general insurance contracts to another person (the **transferee**) in an income year and sections CR
4 and DW 4 (which relate to outstanding claims reserves) apply to either or both of the transferor and transferee.

*Transfer from non-resident*

- (1B) If sections CR 4 and DW 4 apply to the transferee and not to the transferor, the transferee—
	- (a) does the calculations that the transferor would be required to perform under this section if sections CR 4 and DW 4 applied to the transferor; and
	- (b) uses the results of the calculations in the way required under this section for a transferee.

### *Part-year calculations for transfers*

- (2) A transferor to whom sections CR 4 and DW 4 apply does a part-year cal‐ culation immediately before the transfer, as described in subsection (3), for the transferred general insurance contracts, but only for their part-year ending on the day the transfer occurs. A transferee to whom sections CR 4 and DW 4 apply also does a part-year calculation for the transferred contracts, as described in subsection (3), but only for their part-year starting on the day the transfer occurs. The transferee's relevant opening outstanding claims reserve amounts equal the transferor's relevant closing outstanding claims reserve amounts immediately before the transfer, but if the reinsurance associated with transferred policies is not assigned by the transferor to the transferee, the transferee's reserve amounts are calculated without subtracting relevant reinsurance amounts.
#### *Part-year calculations for transfers: description*

- (3) For calculating their income tax liability for the tax year that corresponds to the income year, the transferor and transferee treat references, in sections CR 4 and DW 4 and in the rules for life insurers, to an income year or a tax year as if they are references to 2 separate tax years and corresponding income years (the **part-years**) within that tax year.
#### *Part-year calculations for transfers: effect*

- (4) Transferor's and transferee's part-year calculations may give rise to income and deductions for the income year, but they do not create any part-year tax return obligations.
Defined in this Act: amount, deduction, general insurance, [IFRS 4,](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM2534317) income, income tax liability, income year, insurer, outstanding claims reserve, pay, tax year

## *Introductory provision*

## **EE 1 What this subpart does**

*Quantifying amounts of depreciation loss and depreciation recovery income*

- (1) This subpart—
	- (a) quantifies the amount of depreciation loss for which a person is allowed a deduction if the provisions of Part D (Deductions) are met; and
	- (b) quantifies the amount of depreciation recovery income that is income under Part C (Income).

*When amount of depreciation loss arises*

- (2) A person has an amount of **depreciation loss** for an item for an income year if—
	- (a) the person owns an item of property, as described in sections EE 2 to EE 5; and
- (b) the item is depreciable property, as described in sections EE 6 to EE 8; and
- (c) the item is used, or is available for use, by the person in the income year; and
- (d) the amount of depreciation loss is calculated for the person, the item, and the income year under sections EE 9 to EE 11.

*When amount of depreciation recovery income arises*

- (3) A person has an amount of **depreciation recovery income** for an item for an income year if—
	- (a) the person owns an item of property, as described in sections EE 2 to EE 5; and
	- (b) the item is depreciable property, as described in sections EE 6 to EE 8; and
	- (c) the item is disposed of or an event of a kind described in section EE 47 or EE 52 occurs; and

*Amounts of loss incurred and income derived*

- (4) To avoid doubt,—
	- (a) an amount of depreciation loss is treated as being incurred in the income year for which it is calculated; and
	- (b) an amount of depreciation recovery income is treated as being derived in the income year for which it is calculated.

### *Allocation of deduction for depreciation loss*

- (5) A person who in an income year uses an item for research or development or for market development that gives rise to a deduction allocated under section EJ 22 (Deductions for market development: product of research, development), and as a result has an amount of depreciation loss for the item for the income year, may choose to allocate all or part of the deduction for the depreciation loss—
	- (a) to an income year after the income year for which the person has the depreciation loss; and
	- (b) in the way required by section EJ 23 (Allocation of deductions for research, development, and resulting market development).

#### *Partial income-producing use*

- (6) Subpart DE (Motor vehicle expenditure) and section EE 50 contain rules for calculating the amount of deduction available for depreciation loss in circum‐ stances in which an item of property is only partly used or available for use in a way that satisfies the general permission.

### **EE 22 Cases affecting pool**

#### *Acquired item included*

- (1) If a person chooses in an income year to include in a pool an item of poolable property that they acquire in the income year, the pool's adjusted tax value is increased by the item's cost.
*Separately depreciated item included*

- (2) If a person chooses in an income year to include in a pool an item of poolable property that they depreciated separately in the previous income year,—
	- (a) the pool's adjusted tax value is increased by the item's adjusted tax value on the date it is included in the pool; and
	- (b) the item's adjusted tax value at the end of the previous income year is included in **starting adjusted tax value** in section EE 21(5).

*Insurance or compensation for damage to item*

- (2B) If a person in an income year derives an amount of insurance, indemnity, or compensation (the **compensation amount**) for damage to an item included in a pool at the end of the income year and the compensation amount exceeds the expenditure or loss that the person incurs because of the damage, the excess is subtracted from the adjusted tax value of the pool.
*Item disposed of*

- (3) If a person disposes of an item included in a pool, and derives an amount of consideration from the disposal, or derives an amount of insurance, indemnity, or compensation to which subsection (2B) does not apply for damage to the item occurring before the disposal, any excess of the amount derived over
the expenditure or loss incurred in deriving the amount is subtracted from the adjusted tax value of the pool in which the item was included on the date of the disposal.

*All items disposed of*

- (4) If, on the last day of an income year, the adjusted tax value of a person's pool is positive but the person has disposed of all items that were in the pool,—

### **EE 36 Using economic rate or provisional rate instead of special rate**

*Allowed to use economic or provisional rate*

- (1) A person may depreciate an item to which a special rate applies by applying, instead, the economic rate applicable to the item or a provisional rate applic‐ able to the item. This subsection is overridden by subsection (2).
*Not allowed to use economic or provisional rate*

- (2) The person must not depreciate the item by applying the economic rate or the provisional rate, if—
	- (a) a special rate applies to the item; and
	- (b) the special rate is higher than the economic rate; and
	- (c) the person applies the special rate to the item for an income year; and
	- (d) in a later income year, the item's market value declines at a rate equal to or greater than the special rate; and
	- (e) it is a reasonable conclusion from all the circumstances of the case that the person's purpose, or 1 of the person's purposes, in wanting to change from the special rate to the economic rate or the provisional rate for the later income year is to enable the person to defer the deduction that the person is allowed for the amount of depreciation loss for the item's decline in value.

Defined in this Act: amount, deduction, depreciation loss, economic rate, income year, provisional rate, special rate

- (1) This section applies when a person makes an improvement to an item of depreciable property.
*Income year in which improvement made*

- (2) In the income year in which the person makes the improvement, the provisions of this subpart apply to the improvement, as if it were a separate item of depreciable property, in the period that—

	- (b) ends at the end of the income year.

### *Following income years*

- (3) For income years following the income year in which the person makes the improvement,—
	- (a) a person who uses the diminishing value method or the straight-line method for the item that was improved may choose to apply subsection (4) or (5) unless the item is a grandparented structure, in which case the person must continue to treat the improvement as a separate item of depreciable property:
	- (ab) *[Repealed]*
	- (b) a person who uses the pool method for the item that was improved must apply subsections (6) and (7).

*Improvement compulsorily treated as separate item*

They must do 1 of the following for the first income year, after the income year in which they made the improvement, in which they use the improvement or have it available for use:
	- (a) if they use the diminishing value method for the item, add the improve‐ ment's adjusted tax value at the start of the income year to the item's adjusted tax value at the start of the income year:
	- (b) if they use the straight-line method for the item,—
		- (i) add the improvement's adjusted tax value at the start of the income year to the item's adjusted tax value at the start of the income year; and
		- (ii) add the improvement's cost to the item's cost.

### *Pool method*

- (6) For the purposes of subsection (3)(b), a person who uses the pool method for the item that was improved must treat the improvement as a separate item of depreciable property. If its cost is equal to or less than its maximum pooling value, they must include it in a pool in the first income year, after the income year in which they made the improvement, in which they use the improvement or have it available for use.
*Adjustment of pool's value*

- (7) When an improvement is included in a pool under subsection (6),—

## **EG 1 Election to use balance date used in foreign country**

*When this section applies*

- (1) This section applies when—
	- (a) a person has foreign source income or foreign expenditure that is taken into account in determining the income tax, not merely the withholding tax, payable by them in a foreign country or territory; and
	- (b) the foreign source income or foreign expenditure has been included in 1 of their income tax returns in the country or territory; and
	- (c) the annual income tax balance date that is relevant for them for the income tax return in the country or territory falls in a period that is an income year for them; and
	- (d) if the person did not make an election under this section,—
		- (i) the foreign source income would be allocated to their previous income year; or
		- (ii) the foreign expenditure would be a deduction allocated to the pre‐ vious income year if the only income of the person were foreign source income to which this section applies.

### *Election to allocate*

- (2) If the person has not already included the foreign source income or foreign expenditure in their return of income for the previous tax year, they may choose to allocate the foreign source income or the foreign expenditure to the income year referred to in subsection (1)(c).
*How election made*

- (3) The person makes the election by including the foreign source income or foreign expenditure in their return of income for the income year referred to in subsection (1)(c).
*What election applies to*

- (4) The election applies to all the person's foreign source income and foreign expenditure to which subsection (1) applies, except for—
	- (a) income or expenditure under the financial arrangements rules, unless the Commissioner notifies the person that the election can apply; or
	- (b) dividends, unless the Commissioner notifies the person that the election can apply and the person is not a company; or
	- (c) attributed controlled foreign company (CFC) income; or
	- (d) foreign investment fund (FIF) income or income derived from an attrib‐ uting interest; or
	- (e) in the case of foreign expenditure, foreign expenditure that would be allowed as a deduction if the only income of the person were income to which paragraphs (a) to (d) apply.

*Timing of income*

- (5) The foreign source income and foreign expenditure to which the election applies is allocated to the income year referred to in subsection (1)(c).
*Election treated as continuing*

- (6) An election made by a person under subsection (2) applies for the income year referred to in subsection (1)(c) and all later income years, unless—
	- (a) the person seeks the Commissioner's agreement to revoke the election, and the Commissioner notifies them that they may revoke the election; or
	- (b) the person's net income for the relevant income year would be more than $100,000 if their only income in the income year were foreign source income.

*Net income of more than $100,000*

- (7) If subsection (6)(b) applies,—
	- (a) foreign source income and foreign expenditure is allocated to the income year referred to in subsection (1)(c) only if it was derived or incurred in that year; and
	- (b) foreign source income and foreign expenditure to which the election would have applied if subsection (6)(b) had not existed is allocated to the previous income year; and
	- (c) if necessary, the previous tax year's return is amended.

*Factors considered*

- (8) In deciding whether to agree to an election applying to income or expenditure under the financial arrangements rules or dividends, the Commissioner must consider—
	- (a) whether the person is likely to incur significant compliance costs if the Commissioner does not agree to the election; and
	- (b) the risk to the revenue if the Commissioner agrees to the election; and
	- (c) any other factors the Commissioner considers relevant.

*Person ceasing to be, or becoming, resident*

- (9) If the person ceases to be, or becomes, resident in New Zealand, this section applies in the same way as for other persons except that—
	- (a) it does not apply to income or expenditure that is allocated, other than under this section, to a period when the person is not resident in New Zealand; and
	- (b) if it allocates foreign source income derived or foreign expenditure incurred while the person is resident in New Zealand to a period after the person has ceased to be resident in New Zealand,—
- (i) the foreign source income is assessable income in the income year in which the foreign source income is allocated under this section, despite section BD 1(5)(c) (Income, exempt income, excluded income, non-residents' foreign-sourced income, and assessable income); and
- (ii) the foreign expenditure is allowed as a deduction in the income year to which the foreign expenditure is allocated under this sec‐ tion.

### **EJ 20E Certain mining expenditure spread on basis of units of production**

### *When this section applies*

- (1) This section applies for the purposes of section DU 7 (Deduction for certain mining expenditure spread on basis of units of production) when a mineral miner—
	- (a) incurs expenditure described in section DU 6(1)(a) (Deduction for cer‐ tain mining expenditure spread over assumed life of mine) on or in relation to their mining operations or associated mining operations in a mining permit area; and
	- (b) starts to use the permit area to derive income; and
	- (c) either—
		- (i) uses IFRS rules to prepare their financial statements; or
		- (ii) keeps appropriate records that are sufficient to enable the Com‐ missioner to verify the calculations used by the mineral miner; and
	- (d) chooses to apply this section in the way described in subsection (2).

*Election*

- (2) The mineral miner may make an election to apply this section in relation to the permit area in a return of income for an income year that is the first year in which the miner's commercial production of a listed industrial mineral from the mining permit area starts. The election is irrevocable and applies only to expenditure referred to in subsection (1)(a).
*Reserve depletion method*

- (3) The deduction for the expenditure incurred by the mineral miner and allocated to an income year is calculated using the formula—
(reserve expenditure − previous expenditure)

× reserve depletion for the year ÷ proven and probable reserves.

- (4) In the formula,—
- (a) **reserve expenditure** is the total amount of the mineral miner's expend‐ iture described in section DU 6(1)(a) for the permit area for the income year and earlier income years to which this section applies:
- (b) **previous expenditure** is the total expenditure for the permit area that has been allocated to an earlier income year to which this section applied:
- (c) **reserve depletion for the year** is the amount of a listed industrial mineral produced from the permit area for the income year:
- (d) **proven and probable reserves** is the amount of the proven ore reserves and probable ore reserves of the listed industrial mineral for the permit area as set out in the reserve statement for the area, provided the reserve statement is prepared in accordance with a classification code recognised for the purposes of estimating reserves and resources under the [Crown](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM1120012) [Minerals (Minerals other than Petroleum) Regulations 2007](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM1120012).

## *Appropriate units of measure*

- (5) In subsection (4)(c) and (d), the amount must be expressed in an appropriate unit of measure as set out in the mineral miner's reserve statement, and must be the same measure used in the formula for the items defined in those para‐ graphs.
### *Mines and mining permit areas*

- (6) For the purposes of this section, a mineral miner may allocate expenditure for an income year under this section in relation to a mine rather than in relation to a mining permit area, but only if—
	- (a) the mineral miner uses IFRS rules to prepare their financial statements; and
	- (b) the allocation in relation to the mine is permitted for the purposes of those statements.

## *Transitional provision for existing mines*

- (7) Despite subsection (2), a mineral miner may make an election to apply this section in relation to an existing permit area for the 2014–15 income year. The election is irrevocable and applies to expenditure incurred by the mineral miner in the permit area for the income year and later income years.

## EM 8 Some definitions 1144

## **EM 1 Australian non-attributing shares and attributing FDR method interests**

*Application of this subpart*

- (1) This subpart applies to determine the income and expenditure for a person's hedges, to the extent to which their hedges have a fair dividend rate hedge portion (*see*: subsection (2) below, and sections EM 5 to EM 7), and their hedges hedge—
	- (a) Australian non-attributing shares for which—
		- (i) amounts derived from disposal would be either excluded income of the person under section CX 55 (Proceeds from disposal of investment shares), or the person's capital receipt; and
		- (ii) the person determines the market value for each of a number of periods making up the income year:
	- (b) attributing interests in a FIF for which the person—
		- (i) calculates FIF income using the fair dividend rate method; and
		- (ii) uses section EX 53 (Fair dividend rate periodic method).

*Specific rules*

- (2) In this subpart,—
	- (a) section EM 2 provides rules for who this subpart applies to:
	- (b) section EM 3 provides rules for what hedges this subpart applies to:
	- (c) section EM 4 provides rules for elections to choose that eligible hedges are subject to this subpart by applying either a hedge-by-hedge method or the portfolio method:
	- (d) section EM 5 provides the hedge-by-hedge methods to calculate fair dividend rate hedge portions for a person's eligible hedges:
	- (db) section EM 5B provides the portfolio method to calculate fair dividend rate hedge portions for a person's eligible hedges:
	- (e) section EM 6 provides the calculation to determine the income and expenditure for a person's fair dividend rate hedge portions:
	- (f) section EM 7 provides a quarterly test of the person's fair dividend rate hedge portions, and provides rules that apply if the value of hedge portions to eligible hedged assets exceeds 1.05, including a rule to not apply this subpart:
	- (g) section EM 8 provides some definitions for this subpart.

#### *Relationship with financial arrangements rules*

- (3) This subpart, and not subpart EW (Financial arrangements rules), determines a person's income and expenditure for their fair dividend rate hedge portions. However, subpart EW determines a person's income and expenditure for the portion of a hedge that is not a fair dividend rate hedge portion.

- (3) A person may choose to use a hedge-by-hedge method under section EM 5 for all eligible hedges if the election under this subsection is made before the hedge and any hedge of the hedge is first entered into or acquired by the person. The choice applies for all eligible hedges post-election.
#### *Specific: effect*

- (4) An election under subsection (2) is irrevocable for the life of the relevant hedge, unless the person may choose and does choose, under subsection (6), to use the portfolio method.
### *General: effect*

- (5) An election under subsection (3) may be changed before the relevant hedge and any hedge of the hedge is first entered into or acquired by the person, but is irrevocable for the life of the relevant hedge, unless the person may choose and does choose, under subsection (6), to use the portfolio method.

## **EM 5 Fair dividend rate hedge portions: hedge-by-hedge methods**

## *Fair dividend rate hedge portions*

- (1) This section calculates the maximum fair dividend rate hedge portions for a person's eligible hedges on a hedge-by-hedge basis under an election provided by section EM 4, or the minimum fair dividend rate hedge portions for hedges that are a hedge of a hedge.
*Choice of fair dividend rate hedge portion: cannot be changed*

*[Repealed]*

- (2) *[Repealed]*
*Choice of methods*

- (3) A person may choose to use either the method in subsections (4) and (5), or the method in subsections (9) to (10D), to calculate the maximum or minimum, as the case may be, fair dividend rate hedge portions for all of the person's eligible hedges when the relevant hedge is first entered into or acquired. They may not choose to use, for example, the method in subsections (4) and (5) for some hedges and the method in subsections (9) to (10D) for other hedges.
## *First method*

- (4) The maximum or minimum, as the case may be, fair dividend rate hedge portion for a person's eligible hedge (the **calculation hedge**) is the lesser of 100% and the amount, expressed as a percentage, calculated, using the formula in this subsection, when the hedge is first entered into or acquired. Subsection (8) overrides this subsection. The formula is—
(1.05 

× (eligible currency assets + proxied currency assets)) - FDR hedges amount) 

÷ calculation hedge amount.

- (5) In the formula in subsection (4), all items are expressed in the calculation currency (*see*: **eligible currency assets**), and—
	- (a) **eligible currency assets** is the total market value of,—
- (i) a person's assets described in section EM 1(1)(a) and (b) that are denominated in the same currency (the **calculation currency**) that the calculation hedge hedges; and
- (ii) if the person chooses and is a qualifying hedge fund, their inter‐ ests in assets that are owned by a multi-rate PIE, described in section EM 1(1)(a) and (b), and denominated in the calculation currency:

## (b) **proxied currency assets** is,—

- (i) unless subparagraph (ii) or (iii) applies, the total market value of a person's assets described in section EM 1(1)(a) and (b) that are denominated in a currency (the **proxied currency**) other than the calculation currency, if an eligible hedge that is denominated in the calculation currency acts like hedging for the assets due to a relationship between exchange rate movements in the proxied currency and the calculation currency:
- (ii) zero, if the person has hedges denominated in the proxied cur‐ rency:
- (iii) zero, if the person has a hedge, denominated in a currency other than the proxied currency or the calculation currency, that acts like hedging for the assets due to a relationship between exchange rate movements in the proxied currency and that other currency:
- (c) **FDR hedges amount** is the amount of calculation currency hedged by a person's fair dividend rate hedge portions, but excluding the portion for the calculation hedge:
- (d) **calculation hedge amount** is the amount of foreign currency that is hedged by the calculation hedge.

*Second formula*

*[Repealed]*

- (6) *[Repealed]*
*Definition of items in formula*

*[Repealed]*

- (7) *[Repealed]*
*Exception for more than 100% non-eligible currency asset hedges*

- (8) If the amount calculated under subsection (4) or (9) is less than zero, then the maximum or minimum, as the case may be, fair dividend rate hedge portion for the relevant calculation hedge is zero.
*Second method*

- (9) The maximum or minimum, as the case may be, fair dividend rate hedge portion for a person's eligible hedge (the **calculation hedge**) is the amount,
expressed as a percentage, calculated using the following formula when the hedge is first entered into or acquired:

FDR gross amount × apportioned current hedge amount ÷ calculation hedge amount.

*Definition of items in formula*

- (10) In the formula in subsection (9), all items are expressed in New Zealand currency, and—
	- (a) **FDR gross amount** is the amount given by subsection (10B):
	- (b) **apportioned current hedge amount** is the amount given by subsection (10D):
	- (c) **calculation hedge amount** is the amount of foreign currency that is hedged by the calculation hedge.

*FDR gross amount*

- (10B) For the purposes of subsection (10), the **FDR gross amount** is either—
	- (a) zero if the formula in this subsection does not calculate, when the hedge is first entered into or acquired, an amount; or
	- (b) the lesser of 1 and the amount calculated using the following formula when the hedge is first entered into or acquired:

(1.05 

× eligible currency assets – FDR hedges amount) ÷ apportioned current hedge amount.

*Definition of items in FDR gross formula*

- (10C) In the formula in subsection (10B)(b), all items are expressed in New Zealand currency, and—
	- (a) **eligible currency assets** is the total market value of a person's assets described in section EM 1(1)(a) and (b) and, if the person chooses and is a qualifying hedge fund, their interests in assets that are owned by the relevant multi-rate PIE and described in section EM 1(1)(a) and (b):
	- (b) **FDR hedges amount** is the amount of foreign currency hedged by a person's fair dividend rate hedge portions, but excluding the portion for the calculation hedge:
	- (c) **apportioned current hedge amount** is the amount given by subsection (10D).

*Apportioned current hedge amount*

- (10D) The **apportioned current hedge amount** for the purposes of subsections (10) and (10C) is 1 of the following amounts, expressed in New Zealand currency:
	- (a) if the calculation hedge is not a hedge of a hedge, or is a hedge of a hedge and paragraph (b) does not apply, the amount is the lesser of the following amounts:
		- (i) the amount of foreign currency hedged by the calculation hedge:
- (ii) the amount of foreign currency that is hedged by a person's hed‐ ges including the calculation hedge *less* the amount of foreign currency that is hedged by a person's FDR hedge portions exclud‐ ing the calculation hedge *less* the total market value of a person's non-eligible assets, treating a negative result as zero:
- (b) the negative of the amount of foreign currency that is hedged by a person's FDR hedge portions excluding the calculation hedge, if—
	- (i) the calculation hedge is a hedge of a hedge; and
	- (ii) the amount of foreign currency that is hedged by a person's FDR hedge portions excluding the calculation hedge *plus* the calcula‐ tion hedge *equals* less than zero.

*Relationship with subject matter*

*Lowest amount*

- (2) The fair dividend rate hedge portion is the lowest of the amounts described in subsections (4) and (6).
#### *Period calculation*

- (3) The fair dividend rate hedge portion is applied for a period of 1 month or less, as chosen by the person, for all of their eligible hedges. The fair dividend rate hedge portion is calculated before the start of the elected period, and the elected period is irrevocable, and is applied for all of their eligible hedges post-election, for the income year.
*First formula*

- (4) For the purposes of subsection (2), the amount is calculated using formula—
1 − (non-eligible assets ÷ portfolio hedges amount).

*Definition of items in formula*

	- (a) **non-eligible assets** is the total market value of non-eligible assets:
	- (b) **portfolio hedges amount** is the total amount of foreign currency that is hedged by a person's hedges.

*Second formula*

- (6) For the purposes of subsection (2), the amount is calculated using the for‐ mula—
(1.05 

× eligible assets) 

÷ portfolio hedges amount.

*Definition of items in formula*

- (7) In the formula in subsection (6), all items are expressed in New Zealand currency, and—
	- (a) **eligible assets** is the total market value of assets described in section EM 1(1)(a) and (b) that the person owns directly, and, if the person chooses and is a qualifying hedge fund, their interests in assets that are owned by the relevant multi-rate PIE and described in section EM 1(1)(a) and (b):

### **EM 6 Income and expenditure for fair dividend rate hedge portions**

### *Using the formula to calculate income and expenditure*

- (1) A person uses the formula in subsection (2) for each valuation period described in subsection (3)(b) that this subpart applies to them.

A negative amount from the formula is a person's expenditure for their fair dividend rate hedge portions.
*Formula*

- (2) The formula for determining a person's income and expenditure for their fair dividend rate hedge portions is—
(FDR portions' value + period gain - period loss) × 0.05 × valuation period ÷ days in the year.

- (3) In the formula,—
- (a) **FDR portions' value** is the market value of a person's fair dividend rate hedge portions at the start of a relevant valuation period in New Zealand currency:
- (ab) **period gain** is the net gain multiplied by the FDR hedge portion for rele‐ vant eligible hedges that are entered into and settled within the preceding valuation period:
- (ac) **period loss** is the net loss multiplied by the FDR hedge portion for rele‐ vant eligible hedges that are entered into and settled within the preceding valuation period:

### **EW 15D IFRS financial reporting method**

### *General IFRS rules*

- (1) Under the IFRS financial reporting method, a person must allocate an amount to an income year under IFRS rules modified, as applicable, under subsection (2).
*Modifications*

- (2) The allocation is modified as follows:
	- (a) if the financial arrangement is a financial asset, an amount arising from an impaired credit adjustment under IFRSs is not allocated to an income year. However, when the fair value method is used, adjustments for

> financial arrangements held by the person are excluded from this para‐ graph, if the financial arrangements are not derivative instruments and the person's business includes dealing in those financial arrangements:

- (ab) borrowing costs are not capitalised under NZIAS 23:
- (ac) if the financial arrangement is an interest-free loan, no amount is alloca‐ ted to equity, equity reserves, other comprehensive income, or profit or loss when the loan is initially entered into, and no interest is allocated subsequent to the initial entry:
- (ad) if the financial arrangement is a loan with a fair value (the **loan initial value**) when the loan is initially entered into that, because of the loan's interest rate, is less than the face value (the **consideration initial value**) at that time, then no amount is allocated to equity, equity reserves, other comprehensive income, or profit or loss, to the extent to which the amount relates solely to the difference, because of interest rates, between the consideration initial value and the loan initial value. Also, no interest is allocated subsequent to the initial entry on account of a movement in the fair value of the loan, to the extent to which the movement relates solely to the difference, because of interest rates, between the consideration initial value and the loan initial value:
- (ae) if the financial arrangement is a foreign ASAP, or is an IFRS designated FX hedge for a foreign ASAP, sections EW 32 and EW 33B apply to value, for IFRS rules, the relevant property or service. Section EW 33B also provides rules for subsequently adjusting the treatment of the rele‐ vant hedge:
- (b) even though an amount may be allocated to equity, equity reserves, or other comprehensive income under IFRSs, the amount must be allocated to an income year for tax purposes.

*Fair value method not used for certain financial arrangements*

- (2B) A person must not use the fair value method for a financial arrangement if—
	- (a) the financial arrangement is treated under IFRSs by the person as a hedge of another financial arrangement; and
	- (b) the person uses for the other financial arrangement a method that is not the IFRS financial reporting method.

*Meaning of impaired credit adjustment*

- (3) For the purposes of this section, **impaired credit adjustment** means—
	- (a) for a financial arrangement accounted for under the fair value method, a movement in fair value—
		- (i) through a decline in the credit quality of the arrangement; or
- (ii) through an improvement in the credit quality of the arrangement to the extent to which it offsets earlier movements in fair value described in subparagraph (i):
- (b) for a financial arrangement not accounted for under the fair value method, credit impairment adjustments made under IFRSs.

### **EW 15E Determination alternatives**

- (1) This section applies when—
	- (a) a person chooses in a return of income to use a determination alternative to IFRS for a financial arrangement; and
	- (b) the method is available under its terms for the person to use; and
	- (c) the financial arrangement—
		- (i) is not treated under IFRSs by the person as a hedge; or
		- (ii) is treated under IFRSs by the person as a hedge of other financial arrangements, for each of which the person does not use the fair value method; or
		- (iii) is treated under IFRSs by the person as a hedge of something that is not a financial arrangement.

*General IFRS rules*

- (2) The person must use 1 of the following methods modified, as applicable, under subsection (3) or (3B):
	- (aa) *Determination G3: Yield to maturity*, but only if the financial arrange‐ ment is denominated in New Zealand currency and is not a deriva‐ tive instrument. When applying *Determination G3*, *Determination G25: Variation in the terms of a financial arrangement* must be used:
	- (a) *Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach:*
	- (b) *Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and com‐ modities: an expected value approach:*
	- (c) *Determination G27: Swaps:*
	- (d) a determination made by the Commissioner under [section 90AC(1)(bb)](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM353362) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 or a binding ruling made under [section 91CC(1)(b)](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=LMS186031) of that Act:
	- (e) a method other than those set out in paragraphs (aa) to (d) if the alterna‐ tive—
		- (i) has regard to the purposes of the financial arrangements rules under section EW 1(3); and
		- (ii) is for a financial arrangement similar to 1 to which the methods set out in paragraphs (aa) to (d) may apply; and
		- (iii) results in the allocation to each income year of amounts that are not materially different from those that would have been allocated using 1 of the methods set out in paragraphs (aa) to (d).

## *Modifications*

- (3) For a determination alternative that is *Determination G9C or G14B*, the alloca‐ tion is modified as follows:
	- (a) the term **forward contract** is treated as including a conditional or unconditional agreement to pay or be paid an amount calculated by reference to the price of property or services, without the property being delivered or the services being performed:
	- (b) a requirement that all companies in a group of companies to which the person belongs choose to use the determination alternative is treated as met if—
		- (i) all companies in the group notify the Commissioner that they choose *Determination G9C or G14B* on or before the 63rd day after the person entered into the financial arrangement, or a later time as the Commissioner allows; and
		- (ii) the financial arrangement is the first financial arrangement of the group for which *Determination G9C or G14B* may be used.

### *Modifications*

Version as at

- (3B) For a determination alternative that is *Determination G27*, the allocation is modified as follows:
	- (a) method C must be used, and not methods A, B, or D:

*Succeeding determinations*

## *Consideration*

*Consideration when financial arrangement involves property or services*

# **EW 32 Consideration for agreement for sale and purchase (ASAP) of property or services, hire purchase agreement, specified option, or finance lease**

- (1) This section applies when an original party to an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services, a hire purchase agreement, a specified option,
or a finance lease pays or is paid consideration that includes property or services.

*Value of property or services*

- (2) The value of the property or services is determined by applying, as modified by sections EW 33B, EW 33C, EW 33D, and EW 34 (which relate to certain agreements), subsections (2B) to (6) in numerical order until a subsection applies.
*IFRS foreign ASAPs*

Section EW 33D applies.
*Future or discounted value: foreign ASAPs*

- (2C) If the relevant financial arrangement is a foreign ASAP, the value of the prop‐ erty or services is the value of the amounts paid or payable under the foreign ASAP for the property or services, but ignoring amounts that are expressly provided in the agreement as paid or payable on account of the future value, or the discounted value, or a combination of both the future and discounted values, on the rights date, of amounts paid or payable. Section EW 33B may apply in relation to FX hedges, and sections EW 33C and EW 33D apply.
*Future or discounted value: foreign ASAPs subject to 12 month ASAP*

*Express value: foreign ASAPs not subject to 12 month ASAP*

- (2E) If the relevant financial arrangement is a foreign ASAP that is not a 12 month ASAP, the value of the property or services on the rights date is the value expressly provided in the agreement as paid or payable for the property or services. Section EW 33B may apply in relation to FX hedges, and sections EW 33C and EW 33D apply.
*Lowest price*

- (3) The value of the property or services is the lowest price the parties would have agreed on for the property or services, on the date the agreement, option, or lease was entered into, if payment had been required in full at the time the first right in the property was transferred or the services provided. Two qualifications are—
- (a) this subsection does not apply to an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services that is part of another financial arrangement:
- (b) section EW 34 applies if the consideration is in a foreign currency.

*Cash price*

- (4) The value of the property or services is the cash price of the property or services to which the agreement, option, or lease relates, as determined by [section 5](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM211520) of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003, if that Act applies to the agreement, option, or lease.
*Future or discounted value*

- (5) The value of the property or services is the future value, or the discounted value, or a combination of both the future and discounted values, of the amounts paid or payable on the date on which the first right in the property is transferred or the services are provided, as determined by the Commissioner under a determination under [section 90AC(1)(i)](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM353362) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

#### **EW 46C Consideration when debt remitted within economic group**

- (1) This section applies to the extent to which an amount of debt is remitted and—
	- (a) the creditor is a member of the same wholly-owned group of companies as the debtor and—
		- (i) the debtor is a New Zealand resident company:
		- (ii) the debtor carries on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand and the creditor or an associated person cannot deduct, under this Act or a taxation law of a coun‐ try or territory outside New Zealand, an amount in relation to the remission against income:
	- (b) the creditor is a member of the same wholly-owned group of companies as the debtor and, for the debtor, a group of persons who are New Zealand resident companies (the **NZ group**) hold, before section YC 4 (Look-through rule for corporate shareholders) is applied to the NZ group in relation to their interests,—
		- (i) common voting interests that add up to 100%; and
- (ii) if a market value circumstance exists for a company that is part of a group of companies to which the debtor belongs, common market value interests that add up to 100%:
- (c) if the debtor is a company, the creditor is not a member of the same wholly-owned group of companies as the debtor and the creditor has ownership interests or, as applicable, market value interests in the debtor:
- (d) if the debtor is a partnership, the creditor has a partner's interest in the income of the debtor:
- (e) if the debtor is a look-through company, the creditor has an effective look-through interest in the debtor.

*Some points about this section*

- (2) For the purposes of this section,—
	- (a) the means by which an amount of debt is remitted is immaterial:
	- (ab) the debt includes an amount accrued and unpaid at the time of the remission:
	- (b) a group of natural persons (the **single creditor group**) who are creditors or who have interests in the debtor are treated as one creditor holding the total debts and interests of the single creditor group, if each person has natural love and affection for the others. However, a trust may join the single creditor group if—
		- (i) the trust was established mainly to benefit a natural person for whom each person of the single creditor group has natural love and affection; and
		- (ii) the amount given by dividing the amount of the trust's debt that is remitted for the debtor by the trust's proportional ownership ratio is less than the amount given by dividing the amount of the single creditor group's debt that is remitted for the debtor by the group's proportional ownership ratio (*for example*: $100 remitted by the trust ÷ 40% ownership is greater than $100 remitted by the group ÷ 50% ownership, so the trust may not join the group, even if the required natural love and affection exists):
	- (c) a group of persons (the **single corporate creditor group**) that are credit‐ ors or that have interests in the debtor are treated as 1 creditor holding the total debts and interests of the single corporate creditor group, if—
		- (i) each person is a member of the same wholly-owned group of companies; and
		- (ii) the debtor is not a member of the wholly-owned group of com‐ panies.

*When this section does not apply*

- (3) This section does not apply if—
	- (a) the creditor and debtor are members of the same wholly-owned group of companies; and
	- (b) the creditor is a non-resident; and
	- (c) the debt has been held by a person that is not a member of the whollyowned group of companies.

*Consideration: debtor*

- (4) The debtor is treated as having paid the amount of debt on the date on which it is remitted,—
	- (a) if the relevant debt, creditor, and debtor are described in subsection (1)(a) or (b):
	- (b) to the extent to which the proportional debt ratio for the amount equals the proportional ownership ratio.

*Consideration: creditor*

- (5) Unless subsection (5C) applies, the creditor is treated as having been paid the amount of debt on the date on which it is remitted,—
	- (a) if the relevant debt, creditor, and debtor are described in subsection (1)(a) or (b):
	- (b) to the extent to which the proportional debt ratio for the amount equals the proportional ownership ratio.

*When subsection (5C) applies*

- (5B) Subsection (5C) applies when—
	- (a) the relevant debt, creditor, and debtor are described in subsection (1)(a) or (b); and
	- (b) the creditor is a person to which section EW 41 applies in relation to the relevant debt.

*Consideration: special case*

- (5C) The creditor is treated as having been paid, on the date on which the amount of debt is remitted, the lesser of the following 2 amounts, or the first amount if they are the same:
	- (a) the amount of debt:
	- (b) the amount calculated by subtracting, from the amount of debt, any impairment of the relevant debt under generally accepted accounting practice at the time the creditor is treated under section EW 41(2) as having acquired their accrued entitlement to receive consideration in relation to the relevant debt.

*Some definitions*

- (6) For the purposes of this section,—
**nominal shares** are shares held by the trustee of an exempt ESS, or employees or former employees of the debtor, if the total of those shares represent voting interests in the debtor that add up to no more than 3%, or, as applicable, market value interests in the company that add up to no more than 3%

**proportional debt ratio** means, for a creditor and an amount of debt, the percentage that the creditor's amount bears to the total amounts of debt to which this section applies remitted at the time the creditor's debt is remitted

**proportional ownership ratio** means the creditor's percentage of the owner‐ ship interests or, as applicable, market value interests, total partner's interests, or total effective look-through interests for the debtor, ignoring nominal shares.

Defined in this Act: amount, consideration, employee, exempt ESS, generally accepted accounting practice, group of persons, income, look-through company, look-through interest, market value interest, New Zealand resident, nominal share, non-resident, partnership, partner's interests, pay, proportional debt ratio, proportional ownership ratio, share, trustee, voting interest, wholly-owned group of companies

		- (i) immediately before the arrangement is entered into:
		- (ii) immediately before the issue of the shares; and
	- (e) the terms of the arrangement require the debtor or person A to use some or all of the consideration to pay, directly or indirectly, an amount of the debtor's debt to the creditor; and
	- (f) section EW 46C would not apply if the amount of the debtor's debt is remitted; and
	- (g) the debtor or person A uses some or all of the consideration to pay, directly or indirectly, the amount of the debtor's debt to the creditor.

## **EX 7 Indirect control interests**

*Associates*

- (3) For the purposes of this section, the CFC is treated as also holding any direct control interests in the foreign company held by persons associated with the CFC.
*Attribution to smallest controlling group*

- (4) Subsections (6) to (11) apply to attribute the CFC's direct control interests to the smallest controlling group, to ensure that the attribution exercise does not dilute recognition of a factual chain of control.
*Attribution on basis of respective income interests*

- (5) If the CFC's direct control interests are attributed to more than 1 person, the direct control interests are divided in proportion to each group member's respective income interest in the CFC.
*One controlling group*

- (6) If there is only 1 group of New Zealand residents whose control interests have caused the CFC to be a CFC under section EX 1, the CFC's direct control interests are treated as being held by that group.
### *More than 1 group*

- (7) If there is more than 1 group whose control interests have caused the CFC to be a CFC under section EX 1, the CFC's direct control interests are attributed to the smallest group.
*Equal smallest groups*

- (8) If there are 2 or more groups that are equally the smallest, and 1 group has the greatest total control interests in the CFC, the attribution is to that group.
*Equal smallest groups with equal greatest control interests*

- (9) If there are 2 or more smallest groups with equal greatest total control interests in the CFC, the attribution is made in full to each group.
*No double counting*

- (10) Despite subsection (9), for the purpose of determining whether a foreign com‐ pany is a CFC, a direct control interest may be counted only once.
#### *Sequential application*

- (11) If a foreign company becomes a CFC under this section, this section is then applied to attribute its direct control interests.

		- (ii) zero, if subparagraph (i) does not apply.

*Formula for net attributable CFC income or loss*

- (2) The amount of a CFC's net attributable CFC income or loss for an accounting period is calculated using the rules in section EX 21 and the formula—
attributable CFC − apportioned funding costs − other deductions.

*Definition of items in formula*

- (3) In the formula in subsection (2),—
	- (a) **attributable CFC** is the CFC's attributable CFC amount for the accounting period:
	- (b) *[Repealed]*
	- (c) **apportioned funding costs** is the amount calculated using the for‐ mula—

funding costs × funding fraction × cost fraction:

- (d) **other deductions** is the amount of expenditure and loss incurred in the accounting period by the CFC to the extent to which the expenditure and loss meets the requirements of subsection (13).
*Definition of items in formula*

### **EX 20D Adjustment of cost fraction for excessively debt funded CFC**

*When this section applies*

- (1) This section applies for the purposes of the item (the CFC's **cost fraction**) in section EX 20C(11) to a CFC that is excessively debt funded under subsection (2) in relation to a person (the **interest holder**) with an income interest in the CFC.
*Excessive debt funding*

- (2) A CFC is excessively debt funded under this section if—
	- (a) the amount (the CFC's **debt-asset ratio**) calculated using the formula in subsection (4) is more than 0.75; and
	- (b) the amount (the CFC's **relative debt-asset ratio**) given by section EX 20E is more than 1.10.

*Calculations for CFC*

- (3) For the purposes of subsections (4) to (8), the debts and assets of the CFC are determined under sections FE 8 to FE 11 (which contain rules for determining the apportionment of interest) as if the CFC were—
	- (a) an excess debt outbound company; and
	- (b) the only member of the CFC's New Zealand group.

*Formula for debt-asset ratio of CFC*

- (4) The formula for the CFC's debt-asset ratio referred to in subsection (2)(a) is—
(total CFC's debts − group funding) ÷ (total CFC's assets − total CFC's nondebt liabilities − group funding).

#### *Definition of items in formula*

- (5) The items in the formula in subsection (4) are defined in subsections (6) to (8B).
*Total CFC's debts*

- (6) **Total CFC's debts** is the total amount for the CFC and the accounting period, determined under generally accepted accounting practice, of the outstanding balances of—
	- (a) financial arrangements entered by the CFC, each of which—
		- (i) provides funds to the CFC; and
		- (ii) gives rise to an amount for which the CFC would have a deduc‐ tion:
	- (b) fixed-rate foreign equity that is issued by the CFC and held by a com‐ pany that is a New Zealand resident, a CFC, or a FIF for which the interest holder uses the attributable FIF income method:
	- (c) shares issued by the CFC in relation to which the CFC makes deductible foreign equity distributions to a company that is a New Zealand resident, a CFC, or a FIF for which the interest holder uses the attributable FIF income method.

*Group funding*

- (7) **Group funding** is—
	- (a) if paragraph (b) does not apply, zero; or
	- (b) if the interest holder chooses to rely on this paragraph and the item **total CFC's assets** is greater than the item **total CFC's debts**, the lesser of the item **total CFC's debts** and the total of amounts, each of which is the outstanding balance for a financial arrangement, a fixed-rate foreign equity, or a share giving a right to a deductible foreign equity distribution,—
		- (i) under which the CFC provides funds to another CFC associated with the CFC under section YB 2 (Two companies) or to a FIF for which the interest holder uses the attributable FIF income method and that is associated with the CFC under section YB 2; and
		- (ii) that produces for the CFC an amount that is included in the item arrangement under section EX 20B(4) or is a deductible foreign equity distribution or a distribution for fixed-rate foreign equity.

- (8) **Total CFC's assets** is the total value of the CFC's assets determined under generally accepted accounting practice.
*Total CFC's non-debt liabilities*

- (8B) **Total CFC's non-debt liabilities** is the total value of the CFC's non-debt liabilities determined under generally accepted accounting practice.
*Cost fraction for excessively debt funded CFC*

- (9) For a CFC that is excessively debt funded, the item **cost fraction** for the pur‐ poses of this section is the amount calculated using the formula in subsection (10) and determining the debts and assets of a CFC under sections FE 8 to FE 11 as if the CFC were—
	- (a) an excess debt outbound company; and
	- (b) the only member of the CFC's New Zealand group.

*Formula for cost fraction*

- (10) The formula for the CFC's cost fraction is—
attributable foreign company assets ÷ total foreign company assets.

- (11) The items in the formula in subsection (10) are defined in subsections (12) and (13).
*Attributable foreign company assets*

- (12) **Attributable foreign company assets** is the total value of assets, consolidated under generally accepted accounting practice for the accounting period, of all the interest holder's CFCs and of all the FIFs for which the interest holder uses the attributable FIF income method, to the extent to which each asset is—
	- (a) used for the purpose of deriving an attributable CFC amount or an amount that is included in net attributable FIF income or loss; and
	- (b) not used for the purpose of deriving an amount other than an amount referred to in paragraph (a).

*Total foreign company assets*

- (13) **Total foreign company assets** is the total value of assets, consolidated under generally accepted accounting practice for the accounting period, of all the interest holder's CFCs and of all the FIFs for which the interest holder uses the attributable FIF income method.

### **EX 20E Relative debt-asset ratio for CFC**

*What this section does*

- (1) This section determines the relative debt-asset ratio of a CFC for the purposes of section EX 20D(2)(b) by determining an amount (the **group debt-asset ratio**) for the CFC's group and comparing that amount with the debt-asset ratio of the CFC determined under section EX 20D(4).
*Members of CFC's group and calculations for group*

- (2) For the purposes of subsections (3) to (8),—
	- (a) the members of a CFC's group are—
		- (i) the CFC:
		- (ii) if the interest holder is a company, the members of the worldwide group that the interest holder would have under sections FE 31B, FE 31C, and FE 32 (which relate to the determination of groups) if the interest holder were an excess debt outbound company:
		- (iii) if the interest holder is a trustee, the members of the trustee's worldwide group under section FE 3(1)(b) (Interest apportionment for individuals):
		- (iv) if the interest holder is a natural person, the person's worldwide group referred to in section FE 5(1C)(a) to (c) (Thresholds for application of interest apportionment rules):
	- (b) the debts and assets of the CFC's group are determined under sections FE 8 to FE 11 and FE 18 (Measurement of debts and assets of worldwide group) as if the interest holder, if a company, were an excess debt outbound company.

*Formula for CFC's group debt-asset ratio*

- (3) The formula for the CFC's group debt-asset ratio is—
total group debts ÷ (total group assets − total group non-debt liabilities).

*Definition of items in formula*

- (4) The items in the formula in subsection (3) are defined in subsections (5), (6), and (6B).
*Total group debts*

- (5) **Total group debts** is the total amount, consolidated under generally accepted accounting practice for the CFC's group and the accounting period, of the outstanding balances of—
- (a) financial arrangements entered by the group's members, each of which—
	- (i) provides funds to a group member; and
	- (ii) gives rise to an amount for which a group member would have a deduction:
- (b) fixed-rate foreign equity issued by a member of the group and held by a company that is a New Zealand resident, a CFC, or a FIF for which the interest holder uses the attributable FIF income method:
- (c) equity interests issued by a member of the group in relation to which the member makes deductible foreign equity distributions to a company that is a New Zealand resident, a CFC, or a FIF for which the interest holder uses the attributable FIF income method.

## *Total group assets*

*Formula for CFC's relative debt-asset ratio*

- (7) The formula for the CFC's relative debt-asset ratio is—
CFC's debt-asset ratio ÷ group debt-asset ratio.

*Definition of items in formula*

- (8) In the formula in subsection (7),—
	- (a) **CFC's debt-asset ratio** is the CFC's debt-asset ratio under section EX 20D(4):

Heading: repealed (with effect on 30 June 2009), on 6 October 2009, by [section 160](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM1400358) of the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 (2009 No 34).

## **EX 21 Attributable CFC amount and net attributable CFC income or loss: calculation rules**

*Calculation rules for CFC*

- (1) The rules in this section apply for the purposes of—
	- (a) calculating the attributable CFC amount for a CFC under section EX 20B:
	- (b) calculating the net attributable CFC income or loss for a CFC under section EX 20C:
	- (c) determining under section EX 21D whether a CFC is a non-attributing active CFC.

*Calculation rules for test group of CFCs*

- (1B) For the purpose of determining under section EX 21D whether a member of a group of CFCs is a non-attributing active CFC,—
	- (a) the consolidated annual gross income of the group is calculated under the rules in this section; and
	- (b) the consolidated attributable CFC amount of the group is calculated under the rules in this section.

*CFC treated as New Zealand resident*

- (2) The rules in this Act are applied as if the CFC were always a New Zealand resident.
*Modifications to rules*

- (3) However, the rules in the Act are modified for the purposes of the calculation by the following subsections.
*Conversion to New Zealand dollars*

- (4) The taxpayer must choose—
- (a) for all the calculations to be done in New Zealand dollars; or
- (b) for all the calculations to be done in the currency of the CFC's financial accounts; and if the CFC has no financial accounts, the currency used is that of the CFC's country of residence, the result being then converted into New Zealand dollars at the average of the close of trading spot exchange rates for the 15th day of each complete month that falls in the period.

*Consent for change of currency*

- (5) Having chosen a currency, the taxpayer must use the same currency for cal‐ culating attributable CFC amount and net attributable CFC income or loss attributable to the CFC for each later consecutive accounting period, unless the Commissioner allows the taxpayer to choose again.
*Change for commercial purpose*

- (6) The Commissioner may consent to a change under subsection (5) only if satisfied that—
	- (a) the taxpayer's main purpose in changing is a commercial one, and for this purpose, the reducing of tax is not a commercial purpose; and
	- (b) the change does not have an effect of defeating the intent and application of subpart CQ (Attributed income from foreign equity) or DN (Attrib‐ uted losses from foreign equity) or this subpart.

*New Zealand currency for financial arrangements*

- (7) Despite subsections (4) to (6), New Zealand currency calculations must be used to calculate that part of the attributable CFC amount and net attributable CFC income or loss arising from financial arrangements if—
	- (a) the total value of financial arrangements to which the CFC is a party is more than $1,000,000 at any time during the relevant accounting period, applying section EW 17(2)(b) (Straight-line method) to measure the values; or
	- (b) the CFC's total net foreign exchange loss attributable to financial arrangements, calculated under subsections (4) to (6) for the accounting period, is more than $100,000.

*Limit to subsection (7)*

- (8) Subsection (7) does not apply to a financial arrangement if—
	- (a) it is a variable principal debt instrument; and
	- (b) all the rights and obligations of all the parties to the financial arrange‐ ment are expressed in the currency chosen under subsection (4)(b); and
	- (c) no other party to the financial arrangement is associated with the CFC; and
	- (d) no person enters into the financial arrangement under an arrangement that has a purpose of defeating the application of subsection (7).
- (9) If the taxpayer had no attributed CFC income or loss from the CFC for the previous accounting period, the taxpayer must choose whether to measure the cost base at the start of an accounting period of premises, plant, machinery, equipment, and trading stock of the CFC at—
	- (a) historical cost minus any accumulated amounts of depreciation loss, or another value used by the CFC as the starting value for the period for income tax calculations in the country in which the CFC is resident, but only if the value is below market value; or
	- (b) the starting value that would be used under this Act if the CFC had always been a New Zealand resident.

*Opening cost base: tangible assets: later periods*

- (10) If the taxpayer had attributed CFC income or loss from the CFC for the previous period, the cost base at the start of an accounting period of premises, plant, machinery, equipment, and trading stock of the CFC is the closing value at the end of the previous period used to calculate the income or loss.
*Opening cost base: financial arrangements: first period*

- (11) If the taxpayer had no attributed CFC income or loss from the CFC for the previous accounting period, the taxpayer must choose to calculate the consider‐ ation under the financial arrangements rules for a financial arrangement at the start of an accounting period, at—
	- (a) the market value of the financial arrangement; or
	- (b) the absolute value calculated using the formula—

consideration paid to the CFC + expenditure − consideration paid by the CFC − income.

*Definition of items in formula*

- (12) In the formula,—
	- (a) **consideration paid to the CFC** is the consideration paid to the CFC for all periods before the accounting period:
	- (b) **expenditure** is expenditure that would have been incurred under the financial arrangements rules for all periods before the accounting period if the CFC had been resident in New Zealand:
	- (c) **consideration paid by the CFC** is the consideration paid by the CFC for all periods before the accounting period:

*Amount of depreciation loss recovered*

- (21) When sections EE 48 to EE 52 (which relate to disposals and similar events) are applied, the CFC is treated as having had a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss, and to have an adjusted tax value accordingly, if an amount of depreciation loss has been deducted when calculating the CFC's branch equivalent income or loss for any period and the attributed CFC income or loss of any person.
*GST and value-added taxes*

- (22) When sections CX 1 (Goods and services tax), DB 2 (Goods and services tax), EE 45 (Consideration for purposes of section EE 44), EE 54 (Cost: GST), and EZ 17 (Additional amount of depreciation loss: between 16 December 1991 and 1 April 1994) are applied, references to output tax, input tax, or goods and services tax (GST) payable include a reference to the equivalent item arising under the value-added tax or other tax rules of a country or territory outside New Zealand if the rules have a similar intent and application to the New Zealand GST rules.
*Government grants to businesses*

- (23) When section DF 1 (Government grants to businesses) is applied, a reference to the New Zealand government includes a government outside New Zealand but, to the extent to which section DF 1 still does not apply to a grant or
subsidy to the CFC from a government, the grant or subsidy is income of the CFC.

*Subvention payments*

- (24) If an amount is paid as consideration for the transfer of tax losses,—
	- (a) it is income if derived by the CFC; and
	- (b) it is a deduction if—

		- (ii) deductible under the taxation law of that country.

*Life insurers*

- (25) Subsection (26) applies if—

*Policyholders*

- (26) If the test in subsection (25) is met, the net attributable CFC income or loss of the CFC is the amount actuarially determined to be the part of the CFC's net attributable CFC income or loss to which shareholders, and not policyholders in either the CFC or the parent company, are entitled.
*When subsection (26) does not apply*

- (27) Despite subsection (25), subsection (26) does not apply if the Commissioner—
	- (a) considers that the amount calculated is not a reasonable reflection of the part attributable to shareholders; or
	- (b) has requested and not received sufficient information to enable the actuarial calculation to be reviewed.

*Mineral mining activities*

- (28) Sections CU 1 to CU 9, DU 1 to DU 12, IS 1, and IS 2 (which relate to mineral mining) apply, with any necessary modifications, if the CFC carries on activities outside New Zealand that are substantially the same as the mineral mining activities to which those sections apply.
*Petroleum mining activities*

*Finance leases and specified leases*

- (30) A lease entered into by the CFC before the start of the first accounting period in which the CFC is a CFC is neither a finance lease (subject to the financial arrangements rules and sections FA 6 to FA 11, which relate to finance leases), nor a specified lease (subject to sections FZ 2 to FZ 4, which relate to leases).
*When subsection (30) does not apply*

- (31) Subsection (30) does not apply if another party to the lease is a New Zealand resident, a CFC, or a FIF for which the taxpayer uses the attributable FIF income method.
*Taxable distributions from non-complying trust*

- (32) If the CFC gets a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust—
	- (a) section HC 22 (Use of tax losses to reduce taxable distributions from non-complying trusts) does not apply; and
	- (b) the taxable distribution is not taken into account in calculating the CFC's net attributable CFC income or loss; and
	- (c) section EX 19 applies.

*CFCs with interest in FIFs*

- (33) If the CFC has rights in a FIF,—
	- (a) the rights are not prevented from being an attributing interest of the CFC in a FIF merely because the notional New Zealand residence of the CFC under subsection (2) causes section EX 34 to apply; and
	- (b) the CFC's FIF income or loss is not taken into account in calculating the net attributable CFC income; and
	- (c) section EX 58 applies.

### *Transitional treatment of cross-border reinsurance*

	- (a) the CFCs in the test group are all acquired, or all disposed of, in the accounting period by the interest holder or by members (the **whollyowned members**) of a wholly-owned group of companies that includes the interest holder; and
	- (b) for the period in the accounting period in which the interest holder holds the interest in the first CFC, the interest holder or the wholly-owned members hold an income interest under section EX 17 of more than 50% in the first CFC and in each other CFC in the test group; and
	- (c) the interest holder, or the wholly-owned members, own the first CFC and each other CFC in the test group—
		- (i) at the beginning of the accounting period; or
		- (ii) at the end of the accounting period; and
	- (d) the requirements of subsection (1)(a), (c), and (d) are met.

*Threshold ratio*

- (2) A CFC is a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B(2)(a) for an accounting period and a person if the amount calculated under subsection (3) using the formula in subsection (4)—
	- (a) is less than 0.05; and
	- (b) is not zero under subsection (3)(f).

*Application of formula*

- (3) In using the formula in subsection (4)—
	- (a) each item in the formula is determined—
		- (i) for the CFC's consolidated test group, if the interest holder choo‐ ses to apply the formula to the test group; or
		- (ii) for the CFC, if subparagraph (i) does not apply; and

### **EX 21E Non-attributing active CFC: test based on accounting standard**

*Applicable accounting standard*

- (1) A person (the **interest holder**) who chooses to determine under this section whether a CFC is a non-attributing active CFC for the person for an accounting period must use an accounting standard (the **applicable accounting standard**) permitted by section EX 21C.
*CFC as part of test group*

- (2) The interest holder may choose to apply this section for the CFC as a member of a group (a **test group**) if—
	- (a) the group consists of companies required under the applicable account‐ ing standard to consolidate, whether or not with companies that are not in the group; and
	- (b) each company is subject to the laws of the same country or territory and—
		- (i) has a taxed CFC connection with the country or territory:
		- (ii) would be a non-attributing active CFC if not treated as part of a test group and would have a taxed CFC connection with the coun‐ try or territory in the absence of paragraph (c) of the definition of **taxed CFC connection**; and
	- (c) an income interest of more than 50% is held in each company by—
		- (i) the interest holder:
		- (ii) companies that are all members of a wholly-owned group of com‐ panies that includes the interest holder; and

- (ii) comply with the applicable accounting standard.

*CFC as part of test group for part of accounting period*

- (2B) An interest holder who acquires, or disposes of, an interest in a CFC (the **first CFC**) after the beginning of an accounting period may choose to apply this section to group the first CFC with other CFCs as a test group for the accounting period if—
	- (a) the CFCs in the test group are all acquired, or all disposed of, in the accounting period by the interest holder or by members (the **whollyowned members**) of a wholly-owned group of companies that includes the interest holder; and
	- (b) for the period in the accounting period in which the interest holder holds the interest in the first CFC, the interest holder or the wholly-owned members hold an income interest under section EX 17 of more than 50% in the first CFC and in each other CFC in the test group; and
	- (c) the interest holder, or the wholly-owned members, own the first CFC and each other CFC in the test group—
		- (i) at the beginning of the accounting period; or
		- (ii) at the end of the accounting period; and

	- (a) the amount calculated using the formula in subsection (5) is less than 0.05; and
	- (b) *[Repealed]*
	- (c) the amount calculated using the denominator in the formula in subsec‐ tion (5) is more than zero.

*Application of formula*

- (4) In using the formula in subsection (5),—
	- (a) each item in the formula is—
		- (i) determined under the applicable accounting standard; and
		- (ii) adjusted so that no amount is included in the item more than once; and
	- (b) each item in the formula is determined—

	- (b) **FIF's FIF income or loss** is the FIF's FIF income or loss for the period from foreign companies in which the person has an indirect attributing interest, calculated under the rules in section EX 58(4) and (5) as if—
		- (i) the FIF were the CFC referred to; and
		- (ii) the FIF's interest in the foreign company were an attributing inter‐ est, despite any application of section EX 34.

*Exception to subsection (6)*

- (7B) A person does not have additional FIF income or loss under subsection (6) from a FIF with an interest in a foreign company if—
	- (a) the foreign company meets the test for a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B(2) and the person—
		- (i) *[Repealed]*
		- (ii) is able to include the foreign company in the same test group as the FIF under section EX 21D or EX 21E:
	- (b) the FIF would meet the test for a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B(2)(b) if the items **added passive** and **reported revenue** under section EX 21E(5), (8), and (10) for the FIF included the amounts given by subsection (7C)(a)—
		- (i) relating to the FIF's interests in each member of a grouping of one or more foreign companies including the foreign company; and
		- (ii) reported in the accounts of the FIF, or in the consolidated accounts of the FIF's test group under section EX 21E.
	- (c) *[Repealed]*

*Requirements for test under subsection (7B)(b)*

- (7C) In determining whether a FIF would meet the requirements of subsection (7B)(b) for an accounting period,—
	- (a) the amounts required to be included in the items are—
		- (i) amounts recognised in profit and loss under the equity method under whichever is appropriate of NZIAS 28, NZIAS 31, an equivalent IFRSE, and an equivalent standard or principle in the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America:
		- (ii) amounts recognised in profit or loss under proportionate consoli‐ dation under whichever is appropriate of NZIAS 31, an equivalent

IFRSE, and an equivalent standard or principle in the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America:

- (iii) dividends and net fair value changes recognised in profit or loss in relation to investments accounted for under whichever is appro‐ priate of IFRS 9, an equivalent IFRSE, and an equivalent standard or principle in the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America; and
- (b) an interest holder must not use the result of the test applied to the FIF and a foreign company as a member of a grouping of foreign companies if the interest holder uses for the period a result of the test applied to the FIF and a different grouping of foreign companies.

### *Application of CFC rules tax credit rules*

- (8) The rules in sections LK 1 to LK 7 (which relate to tax credits for attributed CFC income) apply to allow the person to claim foreign tax credits but on the basis of the assumptions made in subsection (9). The rules in those sections allow foreign tax credits relating to attributed CFC income but apply a jurisdic‐ tional ring-fencing approach to the use of tax credits.
*Assumptions in reading tax credit rules*

- (9) Sections LK 1 to LK 7 are applied as if—
	- (a) the FIF were a CFC; and
	- (b) the FIF income of the person from the FIF were attributed CFC income; and
	- (c) the person's income interest, calculated under subsection (4) were their relevant income interest for the purposes of those sections; and
	- (d) any relevant person's FIF income calculated under the attributable FIF income method from a FIF that is resident in the relevant country were attributed CFC income.

## *Reduction in FIF loss to economic loss*

- (10) In the cases described in subsections (11) and (12), the amount of any FIF loss calculated under subsections (1) and (6) is reduced to be equal to the person's corresponding economic loss, if any.
*Application of subsection (10): no economic loss*

- (11) Subsection (10) applies if the person suffers no, or substantially no, economic loss corresponding to the FIF loss, whether because of a call option, a put option, or any other reason.
*Application of subsection (10): FIF loss excessive*

- (12) Subsection (10) also applies if the amount of FIF loss is more than any corresponding economic loss suffered by the person, whether because of the
application of the rules for calculating the person's income interest or any other reason.

#### **EX 51 Comparative value method**

#### *Formula*

- (1) If a person is using the **comparative value method** to calculate FIF income or loss from an attributing interest in a FIF, the FIF income or loss from that interest for the relevant income year is calculated using the formula—
(closing value + gains) - (opening value + costs).

- (2) The items in the formula are defined in subsections (3) to (6).
*Closing value*

- (3) **Closing value** is the market value of the person's interest in the FIF at the end of the income year. The value is zero if the person has disposed of the interest or is then applying another calculation method to it.
*Gains*

- (4) **Gains** is the total of all amounts that the person derives during the income year from holding or disposing of the interest. The amounts include any foreign withholding tax or other amount that the person is allowed as a credit under section LE 1 (Tax credits for imputation credits) or LJ 2 (Tax credits for foreign income tax).
*Opening value*

- (5) **Opening value** is the market value of the person's interest in the FIF at the end of the previous income year, calculated using the exchange rate applying under section EX 57 for that previous year. The value is zero if the person did not hold the interest then or was then applying another calculation method to it. *Costs*
- (6) **Costs** is the total for the income year of—
	- (a) all expenditure, if any, that—
		- (i) the person incurs in acquiring or increasing the interest:
		- (ii) another person incurs on behalf of the person referred to in sub‐ paragraph (i) in relation to the interest:
	- (b) income tax on the income of the FIF—
		- (i) for which the person is liable under the laws of a country or territory outside New Zealand; and
		- (ii) paid by the person in the income year.

*Losses from some attributing interests not subject to rule*

- (7) Subsection (8) applies to a person who calculates under subsection (1) an amount of FIF loss for an attributing interest in a FIF (the **affected interest**) that is not a non-ordinary share described in section EX 46(10).
*No total FIF loss from other attributing interests*

- (8) If, in the absence of this subsection, the person would have under subsection (1) a total FIF loss for the income year from all the person's affected interests, the FIF loss for the income year for the person from each affected interest is reduced to the extent necessary for the total FIF loss from the affected interests to be zero.
Defined in this Act: amount, attributing interest, calculation method, comparative value method, FIF, FIF income, FIF loss, foreign company, foreign withholding tax, income year, loss, market value, pay, tax

	- (a) calculates FIF income from an attributing interest in a FIF for an income year under the fair dividend rate method; and
	- (b) is not required under section EX 52A to use the fair dividend rate periodic method; and
	- (c) does not choose under section EX 53 to use the fair dividend rate periodic method.

*FIF income*

- (2) The person's total FIF income for the income year from the attributing interests in FIFs (the **FDR interests**) for which the person uses the fair dividend rate annual method is calculated using the formula in subsection (3).
*FIF income formula*

- (3) The formula is—
(0.05 

× opening value) + quick sale adjustment.

*Definition of items in FIF income formula*

- (4) The items in the FIF income formula in subsection (3) are defined in subsec‐ tions (5) to (7).
*Opening value*

- (5) **Opening value** is the total of the market values of the FDR interests held by the person at the start of the income year that are not, at the start of the income year, included in a direct income interest of 10% or more in a FIF that, at the start of the income year,—
	- (a) meets the requirements of section EX 35(b)(i) to (iii); and
	- (b) does not have its liability for income tax reduced by an exemption, allowance, or relief referred to in section EX 35(c)(i) or (ii); and
	- (c) is not a unit trust or is a unit trust subject under Australian law to income tax on its income in the same way as a company.

*Exclusion for certain managed funds*

	- (a) the person is a portfolio investment entity, an entity eligible to be a portfolio investment entity, or a life insurance company; and
	- (b) the FIF is a foreign PIE equivalent.

*When quick sale adjustment required*

- (6) The quick sale adjustment is required, and is not zero, only if the person, in the income year,—
	- (a) acquires or increases an FDR interest to which this section applies; and
	- (b) later disposes of or reduces the FDR interest.

*Quick sale adjustment*

- (7) **Quick sale adjustment** is the lesser of—
	- (a) the total of the amounts (the **peak holding method amount**) calculated for each FDR interest from the shareholding for the FDR interest using the formula in subsection (8):
	- (b) the total of the amounts (the **quick sale gain amount**) calculated for each FDR interest from the shareholding for the FDR interest using the formula in subsection (12), treating a negative total as being zero.

*Peak holding method amount formula*

- (8) The formula is—
0.05 × peak holding differential × average cost.

- (9) The items in the formula in subsection (8) are defined in subsections (10) and (11).
*Peak holding differential*

#### (10) **Peak holding differential** is,—

- (a) if no share reorganisation affecting the shareholding for the FDR interest occurs in the income year, the lesser of—
	- (i) the difference between the greatest shareholding in the year and the shareholding at the start of the year:
	- (ii) the difference between the greatest shareholding in the year and the shareholding at the end of the year; or
- (b) if a share reorganisation affecting the shareholding for the FDR interest occurs in the income year, the amount calculated under section EX 54 for the year.

*Average cost*

- (11) **Average cost** is—
	- (a) if no share reorganisation occurs in the income year, the total amount of expenditure that the person incurs in acquiring or increasing during the income year the attributing interest in the FIF divided by the total for the year of the shareholding increase in the attributing interest in the FIF for each acquisition or increase; or
	- (b) if a share reorganisation occurs in the income year, the amount calcula‐ ted under section EX 54 for the year.

*Quick sale gain amount formula*

- (12) The formula, for each acquisition or increase in the attributing interest that is disposed of or reduced in the income year, is—
gain - (interest × average cost).

- (13) In the formula in subsection (12),—
	- (a) **gain** is the total amount that the person derives from holding or dispos‐ ing of the acquisition or increase:
	- (b) **interest** is the amount of the shareholding acquisition or increase:
	- (c) **average cost** is,—
		- (i) if no share reorganisation occurs in the income year, the total amount of expenditure that the person incurs in acquiring or increasing the attributing interest in the FIF divided by the total for the income year of the shareholding increase in the interest for each acquisition or increase; or
		- (ii) if a share reorganisation occurs in the income year, the amount calculated under section EX 54 for the year.

#### *LIFO for identifying attributing interests disposed of*

- (14) For the purposes of subsection (12), attributing interests in a FIF are treated as being disposed of in the reverse order of their acquisition (last in-first out).
*Treatment of transaction under section EX 63 or EX 67*

- (14B) For the purposes of subsection (7), if the person is treated as disposing of or acquiring an attributing interest in an income year under section EX 63(5) or EX 67, the disposal or acquisition is ignored.
*Treatment of attributing interests subject to returning share transfer*

- (14C) For a person using the fair dividend rate annual method to calculate FIF income for an attributing interest in a FIF that is an original share subject to a returning share transfer, the attributing interest is treated as being held by the share supplier, except if—
	- (a) the share user is related to the share supplier:
	- (b) the returning share transfer is or is part of a structured arrangement.

*Meaning of shareholding*

- (15) In this section, **shareholding** means the number of shares or units in an attrib‐ uting interest.

## **EX 54 Fair dividend rate method and cost method: when periods affected by share reorganisations**

*Relevant items and formulas*

- (1) This section provides for the calculation, for an income year or unit valuation period (the **affected period**) in which a share reorganisation occurs, of the following:
	- (a) the item **peak holding differential** for the purposes of the formulas in sections EX 52(8), EX 53(10), and EX 56(15):
	- (b) the item **average cost** for the purposes of the formulas in sections EX 52(8), EX 52(12), EX 53(10) and EX 56(5) and (15):
	- (c) the item **increase** for the purposes of the formula in section EX 56(5).

*Identifying reorganisation periods*

- (2) For the purposes of calculating the items for an affected period under this section,—
	- (a) the affected period is treated as consisting of periods (the **reorganisation periods**) that do not overlap:
	- (b) a reorganisation period—
		- (i) begins with the start of the affected period and immediately before each share reorganisation in the affected period; and
		- (ii) ends immediately before each share reorganisation in the affected period and at the end of the affected period.

*Identifying equivalent shareholdings*

- (3) For the purposes of calculating the items for an affected period under this section,—
	- (a) the amount of the attributing interest in the FIF held by the person at any time (the **comparison time**) in a reorganisation period, is treated as being the amount (the **equivalent shareholding**) of the attributing interest in the FIF that the person would hold at the end of the affected period if, after the comparison time, the person did not increase or reduce the attributing interest in the FIF except under share reorganisa‐ tions occurring in the affected period:
	- (b) the amount of an acquisition or increase (the **acquired shareholding**) by the person of the attributing interest in the FIF other than under a share reorganisation is treated as being the amount (the **equivalent acquired shareholding**) equal to the difference between—
		- (i) the equivalent shareholding for the time of the acquisition or increase; and
		- (ii) the amount that would be the equivalent shareholding for the time of the acquisition or increase if the person were not to have the acquired shareholding.

*Peak holding differential*

- (4) The item **peak holding differential**, for a person and an affected period, is the lesser of the following:
	- (a) the difference between the equivalent shareholding that is the greatest for the affected period and the equivalent shareholding at the start of the affected period:
	- (b) the difference between the equivalent shareholding that is the greatest for the affected period and the equivalent shareholding at the end of the affected period.

*Average cost*

- (5) The item **average cost**, for a person and an affected period, is the total amount of expenditure that the person incurs during the affected period in acquiring or increasing the attributing interest in the FIF divided by the total for the affected period of the equivalent acquired shareholding for each acquisition or increase.
*Increase*

- (6) The item **increase**, for a person and an affected period, is the difference between the equivalent shareholding at the start of the affected period and the equivalent shareholding at the start of the period before the affected period.
Defined in this Act: amount, attributing interest, FIF, income year, share reorganisation

## **EX 55 Deemed rate of return method**

*Formula changes if interest changes*

- (1) If a person is using the **deemed rate of return method** to calculate FIF income or loss from an attributing interest in a FIF for an income year, the FIF income or loss is calculated—
	- (a) by the formula in subsection (3) (the **standard formula**) if the person has held the interest unchanged throughout the income year; and
	- (b) by totalling the amounts calculated by the formula in subsection (5) (the **part-year formula**) for each part of the income year during which the interest is unchanged, in any other case.

*When interest changes*

- (2) A person's attributing interest in a FIF changes during an income year if the person—
	- (a) acquires or increases the interest; or

- (b) disposes of or reduces the interest, but merely receiving an annuity payment from the interest is not a disposal or reduction.
*Standard formula*

- (3) The standard formula is—
opening book value × deemed rate.

*Definition of items in standard formula*

- (4) In the standard formula,—
	- (a) **opening book value** is the book value of the interest at the end of the previous income year, calculated under subsection (7):
	- (b) **deemed rate** is the rate set by the Governor-General by Order in Coun‐ cil for this section for the relevant income year (*see* subsection (15)).

*Part-year formula*

- (5) The part-year formula is—
(opening book value + costs) 

× deemed rate × days ÷ 365.

*Definition of items in part-year formula*

- (6) In the part-year formula,—
	- (a) **opening book value** is the book value, if any, of the interest at the end of the period before the part of the income year, calculated under subsection (7):
	- (b) **costs** is the total for the part of the income year of—
		- (i) all expenditure, if any, that the person incurs in acquiring or increasing the interest:
		- (ii) income tax on the income of the FIF for which the person is liable under the laws of a country or territory outside New Zealand and which is paid by the person in the part of the income year:
	- (c) **deemed rate** is the rate set by the Governor-General by Order in Coun‐ cil for this section for the relevant income year (*see* subsection (15)):
	- (d) **days** is the number of days in the part of the income year; and for this purpose, an acquisition or increase is treated as occurring at the start of a day, and a disposition or reduction is treated as occurring at the end of a day.

## *Closing book value formula*

- (7) The book value, at the end of an income year or, in a case in which subsection (5) applies, a part of an income year, of an attributing interest of a person in a FIF under the deemed rate of return method is, unless subsection (9) applies, calculated using the formula (the **closing book value formula**)—
opening book value + costs + deemed income + top-up amounts − gains.

*Definition of items in closing book value formula*

- (8) In the closing book value formula,—
	- (a) **opening book value** is the book value, if any, of the interest at the end of the previous income year or the part of the income year, calculated under subsection (7):
	- (b) **costs** is the total for the income year or part of the income year of—
		- (i) all expenditure, if any, that the person incurs in acquiring or increasing the interest:
		- (ii) income tax on the income of the FIF for which the person is liable under the laws of a country or territory outside New Zealand and which is paid by the person in the income year or part of the income year:
	- (c) **deemed income** is the FIF income from the interest for the year or the part of the income year calculated under subsection (3) or (5):
	- (d) **top-up amounts** is amounts, gains from holding or disposing of the interest, that are top-up FIF income in the year under section EX 60 or EX 61:
	- (e) **gains** is the total of all amounts that the person derives during the year or the part of the income year from holding or disposing of the interest; the amounts including any foreign withholding tax or other amount that the person is allowed as a credit under section LE 1 (Tax credits for imputation credits) or LJ 2 (Tax credits for foreign income tax).

*Closing book value zero if changing method*

- (9) The closing book value is always zero if the person is using a calculation method for the interest different from the deemed rate of return method at the end of the income year or, in a case to which subsection (5) applies, the part of the income year.
### *Top-up income if deemed rate inadequate*

- (10) If the closing book value of a person's attributing interest in a FIF at the end of an income year or a part of an income year is below zero, the person has additional FIF income equal to the deficit for the relevant income year.
*When subsection (10) does not apply*

- (11) Subsection (10) does not apply if—
	- (a) the person is a natural person; and
	- (b) at all times during the income year the total value of the person's attrib‐ uting interests in FIFs is $250,000 or less, the value of each interest being—
		- (i) its book value, calculated under subsection (7), at the end of the previous income year, if the person held the interest then and used

the deemed rate of return method to calculate FIF income for all attributing interests in the previous income year:

- (ii) its market value, in any other case; and
- (c) the deficit in closing book value arises only because the person disposed of some or all of the interest; and
- (d) the gain that the person derived from disposing of the interest or partinterest is not income, or is income only to the extent to which it gives rise to FIF income.

*Top-up income if gains more than deemed income*

- (12) A person calculating FIF income under the deemed rate of return method can also have additional FIF income under section EX 60.
*FIF income reduced on disposal if deemed rate excessive*

- (13) If a person has disposed of the whole of an attributing interest in a FIF and the closing book value for the relevant income year or the part of the income year is more than zero, the excess is subtracted when the person's FIF income under the deemed rate of return method for the income year is calculated.
*When subsection (13) does not apply*

- (14) Subsection (13) does not apply if—
	- (a) the person is a natural person; and
	- (b) at all times during the income year the total value of attributing interests in FIFs held by the person is $250,000 or less, the value of each interest being—
		- (i) its book value, calculated under subsection (7), at the end of the previous income year, if the person held the interest then and used the deemed rate of return method to calculate FIF income for all attributing interests in the previous income year:
		- (ii) its market value, in any other case; and
	- (c) the gain that the person derived from disposing of the interest or partinterest is not income, or is income only to the extent to which it gives rise to FIF income.

*Secondary legislation*

- (15) An Order in Council under subsection (4)(b) or (6)(c) is secondary legislation (*see* [Part 3](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM7298343) of the Legislation Act 2019 for publication requirements).

## **EX 56 Cost method**

*Cost method formula*

- (1) If a person is using the cost method to calculate FIF income or loss from an attributing interest in a FIF for an income year, the person's total FIF income from their attributing interests in the FIF for the income year is calculated using the formula—
(0.05 
× opening value) + quick sale adjustment.

*Definition of items in formula*

- (2) The items in the formula in subsection (1) are defined in subsections (3) to (18).
*Opening value*

- (3) **Opening value** is the total of the market values of the person's attributing interests in the FIF, being—
	- (a) zero, if the relevant income year is the year in which the person acquires an attributing interest in the FIF; or
	- (ab) the amount that is shown as the net asset value of the interest in audited financial statements of the person for the relevant income year made available to the general public, if—
		- (i) paragraph (a) does not apply; and
		- (ii) the FIF makes available to the general public audited financial statements for its accounting year ending in the relevant income year; and

(iii) the person chooses that this paragraph applies; or

- (ac) the amount of the cost of the interest, if—
	- (i) paragraphs (a) and (ab) do not apply; and
	- (ii) the person acquires the interest in the 2005–06 or 2006–07 income year; and
	- (iii) the interest was not an attributing interest for the income year before the relevant income year; or.
- (b) the amount of an independent valuation of the market value of the interest at the start of the relevant income year, if paragraphs (a), (ab) and (ac) do not apply and the person holds the interest at the start of the relevant income year, and—
	- (i) the interest was not an attributing interest for which the person has FIF income or loss for the income year before the relevant income year:
	- (ii) the person chooses to use the amount of the independent valuation and there is a period of at least 4 income years between the start of the relevant income year and their last application of this paragraph to the interest, during which period they used the cost method for the interest for all income years.
- (c) the amount calculated using the formula in subsection (4), if paragraphs (a), (ab), (ac), and (b) do not apply and the person's shareholding (the **current opening shareholding**) at the start of the relevant income year is the same as the person's shareholding (the **preceding opening share‐ holding**) at the start of the preceding income year; or
- (d) the amount calculated using the formula in subsection (5), if paragraphs (a), (ab), (ac), and (b) do not apply and the person's current opening shareholding is more than the preceding opening shareholding; or
- (e) the amount calculated using the formula in subsection (6), if paragraphs (a), (ab), (ac), and (b) do not apply and the person's current opening shareholding is less than the preceding opening shareholding.

*Opening value formula: no shareholding change*

- (4) The formula referred to in subsection (3)(c) is—
1.05 × preceding opening.

*Opening value formula: shareholding increase*

- (5) The formula referred to in subsection (3)(d) is—
1.05 × preceding opening + (increase × average cost).

*Opening value formula: shareholding decrease*

- (6) The formula referred to in subsection (3)(e) is—
(opening shareholding ÷ preceding shareholding) × 1.05 × preceding opening.

*Definition of items in formulas*

- (7) The items in the formula in subsections (4) to (6) are defined in subsections (8) to (13).
*Preceding opening*

- (8) **Preceding opening** is the opening value for the income year before the rele‐ vant income year.
*FIF income*

*[Repealed]*

- (9) *[Repealed] Increase*
- (10) **Increase** is,—
	- (a) if no share reorganisation occurs in the preceding income year, the difference between the person's shareholding at the start of the relevant income year and the person's shareholding at the start of the preceding income year:
	- (b) if a share reorganisation occurs in the preceding income year, the amount calculated under section EX 54 for the preceding income year.

*Average cost*

- (11) **Average cost** is,—
	- (a) if no share reorganisation occurs in the preceding income year, the total amount of expenditure that the person incurs in acquiring or increasing during the preceding income year the attributing interest in the FIF divided by the total for the preceding income year of the increase in the attributing interest in the FIF for each acquisition or increase; or
	- (b) if a share reorganisation occurs in the preceding income year, the amount calculated under section EX 54 for the preceding income year.

*Opening shareholding*

- (12) **Opening shareholding** is the amount of the person's shareholding at the start of the relevant income year.
*Preceding shareholding*

- (13) **Preceding shareholding** is the amount of the person's shareholding at the start of the preceding income year.
*When quick sale adjustment required*

- (14) The quick sale adjustment is required only if, in the relevant income year, the person disposes of or reduces their attributing interest in the FIF after acquiring it or increasing it. The quick sale adjustment is zero in any other case.
*Quick sale adjustment*

- (15) **Quick sale adjustment** is calculated using the formula—
0.05 × peak holding differential × average cost.

*Definition of items in formula*

- (16) The items in the formula in subsection (15) are defined in subsections (17) and (18).
*Peak holding differential*

## (17) **Peak holding differential** is,—

- (a) if no share reorganisation occurs in the relevant income year, the lesser of—
	- (i) the difference between the greatest shareholding in the year and the shareholding at the start of the year:
	- (ii) the difference between the greatest shareholding in the year and the shareholding at the end of the year; or
- (b) if a share reorganisation occurs in the relevant income year, the amount calculated under section EX 54 for the year.

*Average cost*

- (18) **Average cost** is,—
	- (a) if no share reorganisation occurs in the relevant income year, the total amount of expenditure that the person incurs in acquiring or increasing during the relevant income year the attributing interest in the FIF divided by the total for the year of the shareholding increase in the attributing interest in the FIF for each acquisition or increase; or
	- (b) if a share reorganisation occurs in the relevant income year, the amount calculated under section EX 54 for the year.

*Meaning of shareholding*

	- (b) from a look-through calculation method (the attributable FIF income method or the accounting profits method) to 1 of the 4 cost-based calcu‐ lation methods.

*Treatment as disposal for market value*

- (2) The person is treated as having—
- (a) disposed of the interest to an unrelated person immediately before the start of the first accounting period to which the new method applies; and
- (b) reacquired the interest at the start of the period; and
- (c) received for the disposal and paid for the reacquisition an amount equal to the interest's market value at the time.

*Changes from comparative value method or fair dividend rate method to cost method or deemed rate of return method*

- (3) If a person holding an attributing interest in a FIF changes from either of the comparative value method and the fair dividend rate method to either of the cost method and the deemed rate of return method for calculating FIF income or loss from the interest, the person is treated as having—

		- (i) for a person changing from the cost method, what would have been the interest's opening value under section EX 56 if the per‐ son had applied the cost method for the income year; or
		- (ii) for a person changing from the deemed rate of return method, the interest's closing book value under section EX 55(7) for the preceding income year.

*Changes between comparative value method and fair dividend rate method*

- (5) If a person holding an attributing interest in a FIF changes from either of the comparative value method and the fair dividend rate method to the other of the comparative value method and the fair dividend rate method for calculating the FIF income or loss from the interest, the person is treated as having—

Heading: inserted (with effect on 30 June 2009), on 2 November 2012, by [section 52(1)](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM4691331) of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act 2012 (2012 No 88).

## **EX 73 Election that CFC not non-attributing active CFC or FIF not nonattributing active FIF**

*Election to have elective attributing CFC*

- (1) A person (the **interest holder**) may elect by notice to the Commissioner for each accounting period of the election, that—
	- (a) a CFC of the interest holder, in which the interest holder has an income interest of 10% or more, not be a non-attributing active CFC for the interest holder:
	- (b) a FIF of the interest holder, for which the interest holder uses the attrib‐ utable FIF income method, not be a non-attributing active FIF for the interest holder.

*Exception*

- (2) The interest holder must not make an election under subsection (1) for a CFC or FIF that is—
	- (a) an entity carrying on a business of banking or insurance or is directly or indirectly controlled by such an entity:
	- (b) a non-attributing Australian CFC.

*Period of election*

- (3) An election under subsection (1) is made for all accounting periods—
	- (a) for a CFC, ending in the interest holder's income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009, if the notice—
		- (i) specifies that the election is made under this paragraph or for that period; and
		- (ii) meets the requirements of subsection (4); or
	- (b) for a FIF, ending in the interest holder's income years beginning on or after 1 July 2011, if the notice—
		- (i) specifies that the election is made under this paragraph or for that period; and
		- (ii) meets the requirements of subsection (4); or
	- (c) beginning in the interest holder's income years beginning after—
		- (i) the date on which the notice is given to the Commissioner; or
		- (ii) another date agreed by the Commissioner.

*Timing of retrospective election*

- (4) A notice of election for a period given by subsection (3)(a) or (b) is not effective unless given to the Commissioner by the later of—
- (a) the end of the interest holder's income year in which this subsection receives the Royal assent:
- (b) a date allowed by the Commissioner.

*Currency of election*

- (5) An election under subsection (1) remains effective until the beginning of the earliest income year—
	- (a) for which the election is revoked under subsection (6):
	- (b) in which the election ceases to be effective under subsection (7).

## *Revoking election*

- (6) The interest holder may revoke an election under subsection (1) if—
	- (a) the interest holder gives notice of the revocation to the Commissioner before the beginning of the interest holder's first income year for which the notice is given; and
	- (b) the interest holder satisfies the Commissioner that—
		- (i) expenditure or loss of a CFC included, while the election is effect‐ ive, in net attributable CFC income or loss for the interest holder is extremely unlikely to result after the revocation in an amount that would otherwise have been an attributable CFC amount for the CFC; and
		- (ii) the revocation is not made for a purpose or effect of reducing a tax liability; and
	- (c) the Commissioner agrees to the revocation.

*Expiry of election*

- (7) An election by the interest holder under subsection (1) ceases to be effective in an income year if the election is for—
	- (a) a CFC that in the income year ceases to be a CFC in which the inter‐ est holder has an income interest of 10% or more, except if the CFC becomes at that time a FIF for which the interest holder uses the attribut‐ able FIF income method, in which case the election becomes effective as if made for the FIF:
	- (b) a FIF that in the income year ceases to be a FIF for which the inter‐ est holder uses the attributable FIF income method, except if the FIF becomes at that time a CFC meeting the requirements of subsection (8), in which case the election becomes effective as if made for the CFC:
	- (c) a CFC or FIF that in the income year becomes an entity carrying on a business of banking or insurance or becomes directly or indirectly controlled by such an entity:
	- (d) a CFC that becomes a non-attributing Australian CFC in the income year.

*Requirements for CFC to be affected by FIF election*

- (8) For a CFC to be affected under subsection (7)(b) by an election,—
	- (a) the interest holder must have an income interest of 10% or more in the CFC; and
	- (b) the CFC must not be a non-attributing Australian CFC.

*Effect of expiry or revocation of election*

- (9) If an election under subsection (1) ceases to be effective for a CFC or FIF,—
	- (a) becoming effective for a FIF under subsection (7)(a) because the CFC becomes a FIF for which the interest holder uses the attributable FIF income method, the interest holder may carry forward under section IQ 1B (Losses carried forward to tax year) attributed CFC losses of the CFC to a later tax year as if they were FIF net losses that were attributed from the FIF when the CFC losses were attributed from the CFC:
	- (b) becoming effective for a CFC under subsection (7)(b) because the FIF becomes a CFC of the interest holder in which the interest holder has an income interest of 10% or more, the interest holder may carry forward under section IQ 1B the FIF net losses of the FIF as if they were attributed CFC losses that were attributed from the CFC when the FIF losses were attributed from the FIF:
	- (c) other than under paragraphs (a) and (b), the interest holder must not carry forward under section IQ 1B an attributed CFC loss from an elective attributing CFC, or a FIF net loss from an elective attributing FIF, to an income year for which the election for the CFC or FIF has ceased to be effective.

*Further election*

- (10) The interest holder may make a further election under subsection (1) for a period given by subsection (3)(c) after an earlier election ceases to be effective, if—
	- (a) the interest holder gives notice of the election to the Commissioner before the beginning of the interest holder's first income year for which the notice is given; and
	- (b) the interest holder satisfies the Commissioner that—
		- (i) the expiry of the earlier election was due to an oversight on the part of the interest holder or the CFC or FIF; and
		- (ii) the interest holder gave notice of the further election within a reasonable time after the expiry; and
		- (iii) the further election has no purpose or effect of allowing the attribution of deductions without the attribution of corresponding income; and
	- (c) the Commissioner agrees to the election.

### *Further election for entity by associate of original interest holder*

- (11) An interest holder may not make an election under subsection (1) for a CFC or FIF for which an earlier election by a person associated with the interest holder has ceased to be effective, unless—
	- (a) the interest holder gives notice of the proposed election to the Commis‐ sioner before the beginning of the interest holder's first income year for which the election is made; and
	- (b) the interest holder satisfies the Commissioner that the proposed election has no purpose or effect of allowing the attribution of deductions without the attribution of corresponding income; and
	- (c) the Commissioner agrees to the proposed election.

*Form and means of notice to Commissioner*

- (12) A notice to the Commissioner under this section must be given in the form and by the means prescribed by the Commissioner.

- (1) This subpart provides for the taxation of life insurers on 2 separate bases, the policyholder base and the shareholder base. Sections EY 2 and EY 3 describe the general apportionment of income and deductions between the 2 bases under this Part. Section LA 8B (General rules particular to life insurers) provides some general rules for tax credits relating to the 2 bases. Parts L and O include tax credit rules and memorandum account rules specific to the 2 bases.
#### *Schedular policyholder base income and PIE schedular income*

- (2) Section EY 2 uses the assessable income in a life insurer's policyholder base income, and the life insurer's policyholder base allowable deductions, to cal‐ culate their schedular policyholder base income. A life insurer's schedular income derived by their life fund PIE that is a multi-rate PIE is excluded from their schedular policyholder base income, along with deductions for that income.
*Counting once*

- (3) Income and deductions must be apportioned to either the policyholder base or the shareholder base. There is no double-counting.
Defined in this Act: assessable income, deduction, income, life fund PIE, life insurance, life insurer, life reinsurance, memorandum account, multi-rate PIE, policyholder base, policyholder base income, schedular policyholder base income, shareholder base, tax credit

#### **EY 2 Policyholder base**

*Policyholder base income*

- (1) A life insurer has policyholder base income,—
	- (a) for savings product policies that are not profit participation policies, under section EY 15:
	- (b) for profit participation policies, under section EY 17:
	- (c) under section EY 27(4).

*Policyholder base allowable deductions*

- (2) A life insurer has policyholder base allowable deductions,—
	- (a) for savings product policies that are not profit participation policies, under section EY 16:
	- (ab) for consideration for services provided to policyholders by the life insurer in administering and managing funds intended for use in meeting future policyholder claims under savings product policies that are not profit participation policies, under section EY 16B:
	- (b) for profit participation policies, under section EY 18:
	- (c) under section EY 27(4):
	- (d) under section EZ 61 (Allowance for cancelled amount: spreading):
	- (e) under section LE 2B (Use of remaining credits by life insurer on policy‐ holder base).

### *Schedular policyholder base income*

- (3) A life insurer's **schedular policyholder base income** is the amount calculated by subtracting, from the assessable income in the policyholder base income for the income year, the amounts of policyholder base allowable deductions
incurred in the income year, or available in the income year under subsection (5) or (5B), in the order in which the amounts are incurred.

*Cap on subtracting: ring-fencing policyholder base allowable deductions*

- (4) Despite subsection (3), the total amount that is subtracted under subsection (3), including an amount available in the income year under subsection (5) or (5B), is no more than the amount of the assessable income in the life insurer's policyholder base income for the income year.
*Excess allocations: carrying forward and re-instating next year*

- (5) An amount of policyholder base allowable deductions that cannot be subtracted under subsection (3) in the current year because of subsection (4) is carried forward to the next income year and treated as policyholder base allowable deductions for that income year.
*Transfer of policies with excess policyholder base allowable deductions*

- (5B) If a life insurer (the **transferor**) transfers a life insurance policy to another life insurer (the **transferee**) in an income year and, immediately before the transfer, the transferor has an amount (the **transferred amount**) of policyholder base allowable deductions for the life insurance policy and the income year, at the time of the transfer—
	- (a) the amount of policyholder base allowable deductions of the transferor for the income year is reduced by the transferred amount; and
	- (b) the amount of policyholder base allowable deductions incurred by or available to the transferee in the income year is increased by the transfer‐ red amount, which is treated as being incurred by the transferee for the life insurance policy at the time of the transfer.

### *Exception*

- (6) Despite subsections (3) to (5) a life insurer's schedular income derived by their life fund PIE that is a multi-rate PIE is excluded from their schedular policyholder base income, along with deductions for that income.
Defined in this Act: amount, assessable income, income year, life fund PIE, life insurance, life insurer, multi-rate PIE, policyholder base allowable deduction, policyholder base income, profit participation policy, savings product policy, schedular income, schedular policyholder base income

# **EY 4 Apportionment of income of particular source or nature, and of tax credits**

## *Default basis*

- (1) For a class of policies, income of a particular source or nature, and tax credits received, are apportioned between the policyholder base and shareholder base—
	- (a) in the same proportion as the policyholder base income relating to the particular source, nature, or credits bears to the life insurer's total gross gains relating to the particular source, nature, or credits, in the case of the policyholder base:
	- (b) in the same proportion as the shareholder base income relating to the particular source, nature, or credits bears to the life insurer's total gross gains relating to the particular source, nature, or credits, in the case of the shareholder base.

*More equitable or reasonable basis*

- (2) For a class of policies, the life insurer may use a basis of apportionment that is different from the basis described in subsection (1), if that basis results in an amount, actuarially determined, that is more equitable and reasonable than an amount determined using the basis described in subsection (1).
Defined in this Act: actuarially determined, amount, class of policies, income, life insurer, policy‐ holder base, policyholder base income, shareholder base, shareholder base income, tax credit

Section EY 4: substituted, on 1 July 2010, by [section 185(1)](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM1400398) of the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 (2009 No 34).

#### **EY 5 Part-year tax calculations**

#### *Part-year tax calculations*

- (1) For their life insurance and for their general insurance contracts outstanding claims reserve, a life insurer does part-year tax calculations, described in sub‐ section (2), if they do not have an early life regime application day and 1 July 2010 is not the first day of their income year.
*First year part-year calculations: description*

- (2) For calculating their income tax liability for the tax year that corresponds to the income year that includes 1 July 2010, where 1 July 2010 is not the first day of the income year, the life insurer treats references, in the rules for life insurers, to an income year or a tax year as if they are references to 2 separate tax years and corresponding income years (the **part-years**) within that first tax
year, divided by 1 July 2010 (for example: a rule to calculate an amount of policyholder income for an income year under the replaced rules means the calculation is done for the relevant part-year before 1 July 2010. A rule to calculate an opening reserve amount under sections EY 23 to EY 27 at the beginning of an income year under the new rules means the calculation is done on 1 July 2010, at the beginning of the relevant part-year).

*Part-year calculations: effect*

- (3) The part-year calculations may give rise to income and deductions for the income year, but they do not create any part-year tax return obligations. The 2 part-year calculations compose 1 income tax liability for 1 income year.
*Part-year calculations for transfers: application*

- (3B) Subsections (3C) to (5) apply where a life insurer (the **transferor**) transfers life insurance business to another life insurer (the **transferee**) and sections EY 23 to EY 27 apply to either or both of the transferor and transferee.
*Part-year calculations for transfers: when non-resident transferor*

- (3C) If sections EY 23 to EY 27 apply to the transferee but not to the transferor, the transferee—
	- (a) does the calculations that would be required under this section for the transferor if sections EY 23 to EY 27 applied to the transferor; and
	- (b) uses the results of the calculations in the way required under this section for a transferee.

*Part-year calculations for transfers*

- (4) A transferor to whom sections EY 23 to EY 27 apply does a part-year calcula‐ tion immediately before the transfer, as described in subsection (2), for each class of policy in the transferred business, but only for their part-year ending on the day the transfer occurs. A transferee to whom sections EY 23 to EY 27 apply also does a part-year calculation for the transferred policies, as described in subsection (2), but only for their part-year starting on the day the transfer occurs. The transferee's relevant opening part-year reserve amounts under sec‐ tions EY 23 to EY 27 equal the transferor's relevant closing part-year reserve amounts immediately before the transfer, and if the life reinsurance associated with a class of policies is not assigned by the transferor to the transferee, those reserve amounts are calculated without subtracting relevant life reinsurance amounts.
#### *Class of policies transferred to insurer*

- (4B) If a class of policies (the **class**) is transferred by a transferor to whom sections EY 23 to EY 27 do not apply to a life insurer (the **insurer**) to whom sections EY 23 to EY 27 apply, the opening value of the reserve amounts for the class under sections EY 23 to EY 27 for the insurer is the closing value that the reserve amounts would have for the transferor if sections EY 23 to EY 27 applied to the transferor.
#### *Part-year calculations for transfers: effect*

- (5) Transferor's and transferee's part-year calculations may give rise to income and deductions for the income year, but they do not create any part-year tax return obligations.
### *Part-year calculations: end of transitional adjustments*

- (6) If, for a life insurance policy, the transitional adjustment under section EY 30(7) is calculated for part of an income year, because section EY 30 ceases to apply to the policy before the end of the income year, the life insurer does part-year tax calculations for the policy for the income year, as described in subsection (2), but the income year is divided by the day that section EY 30 ceases to apply. The effect of the part-year calculations is described in subsection (3).
### *Part-year calculations: end of transitional adjustments*

*[Repealed]*

- (7) *[Repealed]*
Defined in this Act: amount, class of policies, deduction, early life regime application day, income, income tax liability, income year, life insurance, life insurance policies, life insurer, life reinsurance, outstanding claims reserve

### **EY 15 Policyholder base income: non-participation policies**

*What is included*

- (1) For an income year, a life insurer's income is included as their policyholder base income if it—
	- (a) relates to life insurance policies that are savings product policies and not profit participation policies; and
	- (b) does not relate to life risk components of premiums and claims; and
	- (c) is not a premium, or is a premium relating to income that is treated under subsection (5) as not relating to life risk components of premiums and claims; and
	- (d) is included in the amount of policyholder base income calculated under subsection (2) or (4).

*Certain income: basis of apportionment*

- (2) If an amount of income meets the requirements of subsection (1)(a) to (c), the amount of the income that is policyholder base income is calculated using the formula—
(investment × average surrender value ÷ average savings assets) + de minimis amounts.

*Definition of items in formula*

- (3) In the formula,—
	- (a) **investment** is the amount of income that meets the requirements of sub‐ section (1)(a) to (c), other than income included in the item de minimis amounts:
	- (b) **average surrender value** is, for the savings product policies to which the income relates, the average surrender value of the policies for the income year. The life insurer may determine an equitable and reasonable basis for the measurement of the average:
	- (c) **average savings assets** is, for the savings product policies to which the income relates, the average market value of assets held by the life insurer for the policies for the income year. The life insurer may determine an equitable and reasonable basis for the measurement of the average:
	- (d) **de minimis amounts** is the amount of income meeting the requirements of subsection (1)(a) to (c) that would be treated as relating to life risk components of premiums and life reinsurance claims in the absence of subsection (5).

*More equitable or reasonable basis of apportionment*

- (4) Despite subsections (2) and (3), for income included in the item investment in the formula in subsection (2), the life insurer may use a basis of apportionment that is different from the one described in subsections (2) and (3), if that basis results in an amount, actuarially determined, that is more equitable and reasonable than an amount determined using the basis described in subsections (2) and (3).
*Treatment of de minimis life risk component amounts*

- (5) An amount of income relating to a policy that, but for this subsection, is an amount related to the life risk of a premium or life reinsurance claim, is treated as not relating to the relevant life risk component for the purposes of subsection (1), if—
	- (a) the life insurer has actuarially determined that the life risk is 1% or less of the premium or life reinsurance claim; and
	- (b) chooses to apply this subsection for the policy.

## *Non-participation policies: reserves*

Heading: inserted, on 1 July 2010, by [section 190(1)](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM2178513) of the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 (2009 No 34).

### **EY 23 Reserving amounts for life insurers: non-participation policies**

*Reserves*

- (1) This section and sections EY 24 to EY 27 apply to calculate, a life insurer's reserving amounts for life insurance policies, other than annuities, that have a life risk component and that are not profit participation policies.
*Actuarial determination*

- (2) All reserving amounts must be actuarially determined, for each class of policies that includes life insurance policies to which this section applies.
*Positive and negative amounts: shareholder base income or shareholder base allowable deduction*

- (3) If a reserving amount calculated under sections EY 24 to EY 27 is a positive amount, the life insurer has that amount as income included in their share‐ holder base income. If a reserving amount calculated under sections EY 24 to EY 27 is a negative amount, the life insurer has that amount as a deduction included in their shareholder base allowable deductions.
*Which reserve can be used when?*

- (4) For an income year and a class of policies, a life insurer has a reserving amount described in—
	- (a) section EY 24, for outstanding claims reserves (the **outstanding claims reserving amount**):
- (b) section EY 25, for premium smoothing reserves (the **premium smooth‐ ing reserving amount**) if the life insurer chooses to calculate a premium smoothing reserving amount and the PSR periods for policies in the class of policies begins, continues or ends in the income year:
- (c) section EY 26, for unearned premium reserves (the **unearned premium reserving amount**), if the life insurer chooses to not calculate a pre‐ mium smoothing reserving amount:
- (d) section EY 27, for capital guarantee reserves (the **capital guarantee reserving amount**).

*Choice*

- (5) Despite subsection (4)(b) and (c), a life insurer may not change between cal‐ culating a premium smoothing reserving amount and an unearned premium reserving amount for a class of policies once the premium smoothing reserving amount is used for the class of policies. If a policy in a class of policies does not meet the relevant requirements described in subsection (6), then a life insurer has an unearned premium reserving amount for that class of policy.
*Meaning of PSR period*

- (6) **PSR period** means, for an income year and a policy in a class of policies, a period—
	- (a) that is a year or more in length; and
	- (b) that is the income year or is a period that begins, continues, or ends in the income year and begins or ends in another income year, and
	- (c) for which—
		- (i) the amounts of the life risk components of premiums payable in the period are level or substantially level:
		- (ii) there is a material mismatch between the timing of life risk and the timing of the life risk component of premiums payable in the period.

Defined in this Act: actuarially determined, amount, class of policies, deduction, income year, life insurance policy, life insurer, life risk, life risk component, premium, profit participation policy, PSR period, shareholder base allowable deduction, shareholder base income

## **EY 24 Outstanding claims reserving amount: non-participation policies not annuities**

*Calculation of reserving amount*

- (1) For an income year (the **current year**), a life insurer has an outstanding claims reserving amount for a class of policies calculated using the formula—
opening outstanding claims reserve − closing outstanding claims reserve.

*Definition of items in formula*

- (2) In the formula in subsection (1),—
	- (a) **opening outstanding claims reserve** is—
		- (i) if subparagraphs (ii), (iii), and (iv) do not apply, the amount of the life insurer's closing outstanding claims reserve for the class of policies, for the income year before the current year (the **prior year**); or
		- (ii) if the life insurer has no closing outstanding claims reserve for the prior year, the amount that would be the outstanding claims reserve for the class of policies, using subsections (3) and (4) with necessary modifications, calculated at the end of the prior year, but using a basis consistent with the one that the insurer used for tax purposes in that prior year (for example, if liability for claims incurred but not reported was not accounted for, for tax purposes, in the prior year, the opening balance calculation does not take into account liability for claims incurred but not reported); or
		- (iii) if the current year is the first year in which the insurer adopts IFRS 17 for accounting, the amount of the insurer's reserve for outstanding claims liability for the class of policies, calculated at the end of the prior year using the basis the insurer used for tax purposes in that prior year; or
		- (iv) if the insurer does not adopt IFRS 17 in the current year and the current year is the first year in which the insurer applies the definition of **present value (gross)**, the amount of the insurer's reserve for outstanding claims liability for the class of policies, calculated at the end of the prior year using the basis the insurer used for tax purposes in that prior year:
	- (b) **closing outstanding claims reserve** is the amount of the life insurer's outstanding claims reserve calculated under subsections (3) and (4) for the class of policies at the end of the current year.

*Outstanding claims reserve calculation*

- (3) A life insurer's outstanding claims reserve is calculated for the relevant policies using the formula—
life risk claims incurred but not reported + life risk claims reported + risk adjustment.

*Definition of items in formula*

- (4) In the formula in subsection (3),—
	- (a) **life risk claims incurred but not reported** is the actuarially determined estimate of present values (gross) for the life risk components of claims not yet reported to the life insurer before the end of the current year, but the insured-against event has occurred. The life risk components must take into account the probability of the claims being paid, and future expenses for administering the claims, but the present value (gross) of relevant life reinsurance claims must be subtracted from the total:
	- (b) **life risk claims reported** is the present values (gross) of the life risk components of claims reported but not yet paid. The life risk compo‐ nents must take into account the probability of the claims being paid, and future expenses for administering the claims, but the present values (gross) of relevant life reinsurance claims must be subtracted from the total:
	- (c) **risk adjustment** is the appropriate adjustment for the life risk compo‐ nents of claims described in paragraph (a) or (b), to the extent to which the adjustment is actuarially determined, reflects the uncertainty of the estimates that arise from the use of the relevant best estimate assump‐ tions, and is not already included in the life risk components of the claims.

### *Determining the present value (gross) of life risk components of claims*

- (5) For the purposes of calculating a life insurer's outstanding claims reserve under this section for a class of policies, **present value (gross)** for the life risk component of a claim under a life insurance policy or life reinsurance policy that is part of the class means the present value of the life risk component that is included in the outstanding claims reserve of the life insurer, calculated—
	- (a) using the discount rates that would be used in calculating the present value, gross of tax, of the life risk component for the purposes of the financial statements of the life insurer; and
	- (b) gross of tax; and
	- (c) net of GST.

Defined in this Act: amount, best estimate assumptions, claim, class of policies, GST, IFRS 17, income year, life insurance policy, life insurer, life reinsurance, life reinsurance policy, life risk, life risk component, outstanding claims reserve, present value (gross), tax

## **EY 25 Premium smoothing reserving amount: non-participation policies not annuities**

*Calculation of reserving amount*

- (1) For an income year (the **current year**), a life insurer has a premium smoothing reserving amount for a class of policies, during the policies' PSR periods, calculated using the formula—
opening premium smoothing reserve − closing premium smoothing reserve.

*Definition of items in formula*

- (2) In the formula,—
	- (a) **opening premium smoothing reserve** is—
		- (i) the amount of the life insurer's closing premium smoothing reserve for the class of policies, for the income year (the **prior year**) before the current year; or
		- (ii) the amount that would be the premium smoothing reserve for the class of policies, using the principles in subsection (3) with necessary modifications, calculated at the end of the prior year, if the life insurer has no closing premium smoothing reserve for the prior year:
	- (b) **closing premium smoothing reserve** is the amount of the life insurer's premium smoothing reserve calculated under the principles in subsection (3) for the class of policies, calculated at the end of the current year.

*Reserving amount: calculation*

- (3) For policies in a class of policies and for PSR periods of the policies, reserving amounts must be calculated using the principles—
	- (a) for an income year, the sum of a reserving amount and the life risk component of premiums equals the expected life risk proportion; and
	- (b) for PSR periods, the sum of a reserving amount and the life risk com‐ ponent of premiums equals the total life risk component of premiums recognised for financial reporting purposes; and
	- (c) the amount in the premium smoothing reserve does not include amounts for policies for which all obligations have ceased.

*Best estimate assumptions for PSR*

- (4) Closing and opening premium smoothing reserve amounts must be actuarially determined, using best estimate assumptions.
#### *Special grouping rule for the purposes of best estimate assumptions*

- (5) For the purposes of determining premium smoothing reserve amounts, life insurance policies may be grouped together if the policies have in common,—
	- (a) substantially the same contractual terms and conditions, other than their PSR periods; and
	- (b) substantially the same assumptions for pricing their life risk.

*Meaning of expected life risk proportion*

- (6) In this section, **expected life risk proportion** means, for life insurance policies in a class of policies and an income year, the proportion of the premiums that fairly reflects the proportion of the life risk and the life risk renewal expenses, for the term of the policy, expected to be borne in the income year and is determined from the corresponding proportions calculated, for each PSR period that begins, continues, or ends in the income year,—
	- (a) as at the beginning of the income year or the beginning of the PSR period, whichever is later; and
	- (b) assuming that the policies still exist at the end of the income year or the end of the PSR period, whichever is earlier.

Defined in this Act: amount, actuarially determined, best estimate assumptions, class of policies, expected life risk proportion, income year, life insurance policy, life insurer, life risk, life risk component, premium, PSR period

## **EY 28 Shareholder base other profit: profit participation policies that are existing business**

*Calculation of income*

- (1) For an income year, a life insurer has an amount, for profit participation policies that are existing business, that is calculated using the formula—
other profit × gate ÷ (1 + gate).

- (2) In the formula in subsection (1),—
- (a) **other profit** is the amount calculated for the income year under subsec‐ tion (4):
- (b) **gate** is the proportion of a policyholder's share of profits from the asset base that is used in the formula that calculates a transfer to the benefit of the life insurer's shareholders from the profits of the asset base, as described in paragraph (a)(iii) of the definition of **profit participation policy**.

*Formula: negative amounts and positive amounts*

- (3) If, for an income year, the formula in subsection (1) calculates a positive amount, that amount is included as income in the life insurer's shareholder base income. If it is a negative amount, then that amount is included as a deduction in the life insurer's shareholder base allowable deductions.
## *Other profit*

- (4) For the purposes of the item **other profit** in subsection (2), an amount is calcu‐ lated, for the income year (the **current year**) for profit participation policies that are existing business, using the following formula:
(premiums − premiums estimate) − (claims − claims estimate) − (closing liabilities − estimated closing liabilities).

- (5) In the formula in subsection (4),—
	- (a) **premiums** is the amount of premiums for policies for the current year, but subtracting relevant life reinsurance premiums:
	- (b) **premiums estimate** is the actuarially determined total amount of pre‐ miums that the life insurer expected, using best estimate assumptions, to receive in the current year for policies that were in force at the start of the current year or are first entered into in the current year, after subtracting the value, net of tax and used in the life insurer's financial accounts, of relevant life reinsurance premiums for the current year:
	- (c) **claims** is the amount of claims for the current year, after subtracting relevant life reinsurance claims:
	- (d) **claims estimate** is the actuarially determined total amount of claims that the life insurer expected, using best estimate assumptions, to receive in the current year for policies that were in force at the start of the current year or are first entered into in the current year, after subtracting the value, net of tax and used in the life insurer's financial accounts, of relevant life reinsurance claims for the current year:
	- (e) **closing liabilities** is the total amount, determined as at the end of the current year for policies that are in force at the end of the current year, of the policy liabilities including benefits that vest by the end of the current year:

- (f) **estimated closing liabilities** is the total amount, estimated as at the beginning of the current year for policies that are in force at the start of the current year and expected to be in force at the end of the current year, of the policy liabilities including benefits that vest by the end of the current year.
*Policy liability*

- (6) For the purposes of subsection (5), the policy liability for a policy is an amount that is actuarially determined for the policy using best estimate assumptions and that—
	- (a) is the total amount of future claims, future expenditure or loss, and future tax payments, reduced by the amount of future premiums; and
	- (b) is obtained using present values that are net of tax and used in the life insurer's financial accounts and allowing for life reinsurance premiums and life reinsurance claims; and
	- (c) does not include bonus declarations that vest after the current year.

*Basis of best estimate assumptions in actuarially determining items*

- (7) The same best estimate assumptions must be used for actuarially determining amounts under subsections (5) and (6). The assumptions may be appropriate for the start of the year, or for the end of the year, but once the choice is made between start of the year and end of the year, that basis may not be changed.
*Meaning of existing business*

- (8) For the purposes of this section and section EY 29, **existing business** means, for a policy, that it is—
	- (a) issued on or before 30 June 2009:
	- (b) issued after 30 June 2009, if—
		- (i) issued on the same substantial and material terms, conditions, and bonus entitlements as profit participation policies that the life insurer issued on or before 30 June 2009, ignoring any annual increase in life insurance cover that is less than 10% or less than annual percentage change in the Consumers Price Index (all groups):
		- (ii) issued as the result of conversion rights in a policy issued on or before 30 June 2009:
	- (c) the replacement of another policy (the **replaced policy**) caused by a life insurer being sold, or selling or transferring its rights and obligations under the replaced policy, and—
		- (i) the replaced policy was existing business under this subsection; and
		- (ii) the replaced policy and the policy have the same substantial and material terms, conditions, and bonus entitlements ignoring any

annual increase in life insurance cover that is less than 10% or is less than the annual percentage change in the Consumers Price Index (all groups).

## **EY 29 Shareholder base other profit: profit participation policies that are new business**

*Calculation of income*

- (1) For an income year, a life insurer has an amount, for profit participation policies that are new business, that is calculated using the formula—
(other profit × gate ÷ (1 + gate)) − previous negative amount.

*Definition of items in formula*

- (2) In the formula in subsection (1),—
	- (a) **other profit** is the amount calculated for the income year under subsec‐ tions (5) to (9):
	- (b) **gate** is the proportion of a policyholder's share of profits from the asset base that is used in the formula that calculates a transfer to the benefit of the life insurer's shareholders from the profits of the asset base, as described in paragraph (a)(iii) of the definition of **profit participation policy**:
	- (c) **previous negative amount** is the amount from the previous year described in subsections (3) and (4).

*Formula: negative amounts and positive amounts*

- (3) If, for an income year, the formula in subsection (1) calculates a positive amount, that amount is included as income in the life insurer's shareholder base income. If it is a negative amount, then that amount is not included as a deduction in the life insurer's shareholder base allowable deductions, but *see* subsection (4).
*Negative amounts: carry forward*

- (4) The amount by which the amount calculated using the formula in subsection (1) is less than zero is carried forward to the next income year, to be used under this section in the formula as the item **previous negative amount** in that next year.
*Other profit*

- (5) For the purposes of the item **other profit** in subsection (2), an amount is calcu‐ lated, for the income year (the **current year**) for profit participation policies that are new business, using the following formula:
(premiums - premiums estimate) - (claims - claims estimate) - (closing liabilities - estimated closing liabilities).

*Definition of items in formula*

- (6) In the formula in subsection (5),—
	- (a) **premiums** is the amount of premiums for policies for the current year, but subtracting relevant life reinsurance premiums:
	- (b) **premiums estimate** is the amount of valuation premiums that the life insurer expected, using best estimate assumptions, to receive in the current year for policies that are in force at the start of the current year, or are first entered into in the current year, after subtracting the value, net of tax and used in the life insurer's financial accounts, of relevant life reinsurance premiums for the current year:
	- (c) **claims** is the amount of claims for the current year, after subtracting relevant life reinsurance claims:
	- (d) **claims estimate** is the actuarially determined amount of claims that the life insurer expected, using best estimate assumptions, to receive in the current year for policies that are in force at the start of the current year, or are first entered into in the current year, ignoring surrenders and after subtracting the value, net of tax and used in the life insurer's financial accounts, of relevant life reinsurance claims for the current year:
	- (e) **closing liabilities** is the total amount, determined as at the end of the current year for policies that are in force at the end of the current year, of the policy liabilities including benefits that vest by the end of the current year:
	- (f) **estimated closing liabilities** is the total amount, estimated as at the beginning of the current year for policies that are in force at the start of the current year and expected to be in force at the end of the current year, of the policy liabilities including benefits that vest by the end of the current year.

*Meaning of valuation premiums*

- (7) In this section, **valuation premiums** means the amount of premiums payable for a policy, actuarially determined by reference to the premium formula used when the policy was first entered into, or, if the premium formula is unavaila‐ ble, by reference to mortality, expense, and other assumptions applicable to premiums for similar policies at the beginning of the income year in which the policy was first entered into. The valuation premiums must not include any allowance for future bonus declarations or future shareholder profits. The
amount of the valuation premium for a policy must not change, unless signifi‐ cant changes to the policy justify changing the valuation premium.

*Policy liability*

- (8) For the purposes of subsection (6), the policy liability for a policy is an amount that is actuarially determined for the policy using best estimate assumptions and that—
	- (a) is the greater of the current surrender value of the policy and the amount that is the total amount of future mortality and maturity claims, future expenditure or loss, and future tax payments, reduced by the amount of future valuation premiums; and
	- (b) is obtained using present values that are net of tax and used in the life insurer's financial accounts and allowing for relevant life reinsurance premiums and relevant life reinsurance claims; and
	- (c) does not include bonus declarations that vest after the current year; and
	- (d) does not include an allowance for surrenders or the payment of surrender values.

*Basis of best estimate assumptions in actuarially determining items*

- (9) The same best estimate assumptions must be used for actuarially determining amounts under subsections (6), (7), and (8). The assumptions may be appropri‐ ate for the start of the year, or for the end of the year, but once the choice is made between start of the year and end of the year, the assumptions must not be changed.
*Meaning of new business*

- (10) For the purposes of this section, **new business** means, for a policy, that it is not existing business under section EY 28.

*Definition of items in formula*

- (3) The items in the formula are defined in subsections (4) to (9).
*Specific liability*

- (4) **Specific liability** is the amount in the life insurer's total liability on the last day of the 1987–88 income year for the following matters covered by the life insurer's Life Insurance Fund:

*Property acquired before last day of 1982–83 income year*

- (7) For property acquired on or before the last day of the 1982–83 income year, the property sum is calculated by subtracting the specified base cost for 1983 income year property from the market value of the property on 1 April 1988.
*Property acquired after end of 1982–83 income year: not financial arrangement*

- (8) For property acquired after the end of the 1982–83 income year that is not a financial arrangement, the property sum is calculated by subtracting the cost price or acquisition value of the property from the market value of the property on 1 April 1988.
*Property acquired after end of 1982–83 income year: financial arrangement*

- (9) For property acquired after the end of the 1982–83 income year that is a financial arrangement, the property sum is the base price adjustment for the arrangement, calculated as if the arrangement had matured on 1 April 1988 but using the formula in section EW 31 (Base price adjustment formula).

	- (c) would have, in the absence of this section, from the earthquake com‐ pensation for the affected property in the affected class, depreciation recovery income under section EE 48 (Effect of disposal or event) in or before the current year; and
	- (d) has a total amount of depreciation loss under section EE 48 for the affected property in the affected class that, treated as a positive amount, is less than the total amount of depreciation recovery income referred to in paragraph (c) by an amount (the **excess recovery**); and

	- (f) notifies the Commissioner under subsection (9)—
		- (i) specifying the affected property and affected class; and
		- (ii) linking, for the purposes of this section, each item of acquired replacement property with an affected class.

*Suspended recovery income*

- (2) For an affected class, the amount that may be depreciation recovery income of the person in or after the current year (the **suspended recovery income**) is the excess recovery that remains at the beginning of the current year after—
	- (a) adjustment under subsections (3) and (6) for an earlier income year; and

- (b) attribution to an earlier income year by subsection (8).
*Depreciation recovery income*

- (2B) The person has an amount of depreciation recovery income for the current year equal to the amount of suspended recovery income that is attributed to the current year by subsection (8).
*Effect of acquiring item of replacement property if suspended recovery income from affected property not in pool*

- (3) If the person acquires an item of replacement property (the **replacement item**) and links the replacement item with an affected class of affected property for which the person does not use the pool method, the amount given by subsection (4)—
	- (a) is treated as not being included in the amount of the person's expenditure on the replacement item, for the purposes of determining—
		- (i) under section EE 16(4) (Amount resulting from standard calcula‐ tion) the item value or cost for the replacement item, if the person uses the diminishing value method or straight-line method for the replacement item; or
		- (ii) under section EE 22 (Cases affecting pool) the cost of the replace‐ ment item, if the person uses the pool method for the replacement item; and
	- (b) is a reduction in the amount of the suspended recovery income for the affected class.

*Amount of reduction: expenditure on replacement item and suspended recovery income*

- (4) The amount of the reduction under subsection (3)(a) or (b) for a replacement item and an affected class of affected property for which the person does not use the pool method is—
	- (a) zero, if the cost of the affected class equals or is less than the per‐ son's total expenditure in acquiring, before the replacement item, other replacement property linked with the affected class; or
	- (b) the amount calculated using the formula—

limited replacement cost × excess ÷ affected cost.

*Definition of items in formula*

(5) In the formula,—

- (a) **limited replacement cost** is the lesser of the following:
	- (i) the amount by which the cost of the affected class exceeds the total expenditure in acquiring, before the replacement item, other replacement property linked with the affected class:
	- (ii) the amount of the expenditure on the replacement item:
- (b) **excess** is the excess recovery for the affected class:
- (c) **affected cost** is the total cost for the person of the affected class.

*Effect of acquiring item of replacement property if suspended recovery income from affected property in pool*

- (6) If the person acquires an item of replacement property (the **replacement item**) and links the replacement item with an affected class of affected property for which the person uses the pool method,—
	- (a) the amount of the person's expenditure on the replacement item is treated as being reduced, by the amount equal to the lesser of the amount of expenditure on the replacement item and the amount of suspended recovery income for the affected property after the acquisition of other replacement property before the replacement item, for the purposes of determining—
		- (i) the adjusted tax value of the replacement item, if subparagraphs (ii) or (iii) do not apply; or
		- (ii) the cost of the replacement item for the straight-line method, if that method is used to determine depreciation loss for the replace‐ ment item; or
		- (iii) the adjusted tax value of the pool of the replacement item, if the person uses the pool method for the replacement item; and
	- (b) the amount of the suspended recovery income for the affected class is reduced by the amount of the treated reduction under paragraph (a).

*Requirements for replacement property*

- (7) An item of replacement property for a person must—
	- (a) *[Repealed]*
	- (b) *[Repealed]*
	- (c) be included in the same category under subsection (10)(b) as the affected class with which the person links the item, if the affected class is described in subsection (10)(b)(i) or (ii); and
	- (d) be located in greater Christchurch as that term is defined in [section 4](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM3570801) of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011, if the item is a building or commercial fit-out.

*Attribution of suspended recovery income to income year: other events*

- (8) The person has, in the current year, an amount of depreciation recovery income for an affected class equal to the amount of suspended recovery income for the affected class—
	- (a) at the end of the current year, if that year is the 2023–24 income year and neither of paragraphs (b) and (c) apply earlier; or
- (b) when in the current year the person decides not to acquire more replace‐ ment property, if neither of paragraphs (a) and (c) apply earlier; or
- (c) when in the current year the person goes into liquidation or becomes bankrupt, if neither of paragraphs (a) and (b) apply earlier.

*Notice of election for affected property*

- (9) A person choosing to rely on this section to suspend in a current year the recognition of suspended recovery income from the insurance or compensation for affected property must notify the Commissioner—
	- (a) for the earliest income year (the **estimate year**) in which the amount of the insurance or compensation for the affected property can be reason‐ ably estimated, by the later of 31 January 2012 and the date on which the return of income is filed for the estimate year; and
	- (b) if the current year is after the estimate year,—
		- (i) for each income year between the estimate year and the current year, by the date on which the return of income is filed for that income year; and
		- (ii) for the current year, by the date on which the return of income is filed for the current year.

*Contents of notice of election*

- (10) A notice under subsection (9) must—
	- (a) describe the items of affected property; and
	- (b) indicate in which of the following categories each item of affected prop‐ erty is included:

	- (d) give the amount of the expenditure on the replacement item and the reduction under subsection (3) or (6) of that expenditure for the purposes of determining adjusted tax value or depreciation loss; and
	- (e) give the amount, for the affected class, of the suspended recovery income at the end of the current year.

*Disposal of replacement property: reduction in cost treated as depreciation loss*

- (11) For the purposes of section EE 48, the amount by which a person's expenditure on a replacement item is treated as being reduced under subsection (3) or (6)
is an amount of depreciation loss for the item for which the person has been allowed a deduction.

*Removal of link by election under section EZ 23BB*

- (11B) If a person in the current year has an amount of suspended recovery income for an affected class of buildings and has made an election under this section to link replacement property (the **linked property**) to the affected class and has not incurred expenditure in acquiring the linked property,—
	- (a) the person may choose to make an election under section EZ 23BB linking the affected class with replacement property, which may include linked property:
	- (b) a consequence of an election referred to in paragraph (a) is that the affected class and the linked property are treated as not being linked under this section for the current year.

*Order of acquisition for items acquired at same time*

- (11C) If items of replacement property are acquired at the same time and the effect of this section depends on the order in which the items are acquired, the items are treated as being acquired in the order chosen by the person in the first return of income for which the order of acquisition is taken into account.
*Relationship to subpart EE*

- (12) This section overrides subpart EE (Depreciation).

## **EZ 23BB Interest in property acquired after depreciable property affected by Canterbury earthquakes**

- (1) This section applies for a person and an income year (the **current year**) before the 2024–25 income year when the person,—
	- (a) in or before the current year, receives insurance or compensation (the **earthquake compensation**) for items of depreciable property (the **affected property**), each of which is—
		- (i) not depreciable intangible property; and
		- (ii) not property for which the person uses the pool method; and
		- (iii) included in 1 of the categories (an **affected class**) of the person's depreciable property referred to in subsection (11)(b); and
		- (iv) not linked with replacement property under section EZ 23B or has a link with replacement property that may be removed under section EZ 23B(11B); and
- (b) is entitled to the earthquake compensation because each item of the affected property, as a result of a Canterbury earthquake as that term is defined in [section 4](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM3570801) of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011, is affected by—
	- (i) damage meeting the requirements of section EE 47(4) (Events for purposes of section EE 44); or
	- (ii) a disposal and reacquisition under section EZ 23C or EZ 70; and
- (c) would have, in the absence of this section, from the earthquake compen‐ sation for the affected class, depreciation recovery income under section EE 48 (Effect of disposal or event) in or before the current year; and
- (d) has a total amount of depreciation loss under section EE 48 for the affected class that, treated as a positive amount, is less than the total amount of depreciation recovery income referred to in paragraph (c) by an amount (the **excess recovery**); and
- (e) has in the current year an interest (a **replacement interest**) in a voting interest in a company (the **owning company**) having the purpose of acquiring depreciable property (the **replacement property**) meeting the requirements of subsection (6); and
- (f) holds the voting interest in the owning company or is the settlor of a trust of which the trustee holds the voting interest; and
- (g) notifies the Commissioner under subsection (10).

*Suspended recovery income*

- (2) For a replacement interest, the amount that may be depreciation recovery income of the person in or after the current year (the **suspended recovery income**) is the excess recovery, for the affected property with which the replacement interest is linked under subsections (10) and (11), that remains at the beginning of the current year after—
	- (a) adjustment under subsections (3), (8), and (9) for an earlier income year; and
	- (b) attribution to an earlier income year by subsections (8) to (10).

*Effect of acquiring interest in replacement property if suspended recovery income from affected class*

- (3) If the person acquires a replacement interest and links the replacement interest with an affected class, the amount calculated using the formula in subsection (4)—
	- (a) is an amount of suspended recovery income for the replacement interest; and
	- (b) is a reduction in the amount of the depreciation recovery income for the affected class.

*Suspended recovery income for replacement interest and reduction of suspended recovery income for affected class*

- (4) The amount under subsection (3)(a) and (b) for a replacement interest and affected class is—
	- (a) zero, if the cost of the affected property in the affected class equals or is less than the total of the fractional interest values for other replacement interests acquired by the person before the replacement interest; or
	- (b) the amount calculated using the formula—

limited replacement cost × excess ÷ affected cost.

*Definition of items in formula*

- (5) In the formula,—
	- (a) **limited replacement cost** is the lesser of—
		- (i) the fractional interest value of the replacement interest:
		- (ii) the amount by which the total cost for the person of the affected property in the affected class exceeds the total amount of the fractional interest values of other replacement interests acquired by the person before the replacement interest:
	- (b) **excess** is the excess recovery for the affected class:
	- (c) **affected cost** is the total cost for the person of the affected property in the affected class.

*Requirements for replacement property*

- (6) An item of replacement property for a person or owning company must—
	- (a) be included in the same category under subsection (11)(b) as the affected class with which the person links the item, if the affected class is described in subsection (11)(b)(i) or (ii); and
	- (b) be located in greater Christchurch as that term is defined in [section 4](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM3570801) of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011, if the item is a building or commercial fit-out.

*Depreciation recovery income and suspended recovery income*

- (7) The amount of suspended recovery income for a person's replacement interest is not depreciation recovery income for the person arising from the replace‐ ment interest unless it is attributed to an income year by subsections (8) and (9).

## **EZ 35 Accruals in relation to income and expenditure in respect of financial arrangements**

- (1) For the purpose of calculating the amount deemed to be income or expenditure of any person under subsections (2) to (7), regard must be had to,—
- (a) if the person is a holder in relation to the financial arrangement,—
	- (i) the amount of all consideration paid and to be paid to the person in relation to the financial arrangement; and
	- (ii) any amount remitted and to be remitted by the person in relation to the financial arrangement; and
	- (iii) the acquisition price of the financial arrangement in relation to the person; and
- (b) if the person is an issuer in relation to the financial arrangement,—
	- (i) the amount of all consideration paid and to be paid by the person in relation to the financial arrangement; and
	- (ii) the acquisition price of the financial arrangement in relation to the person.
- (2) Subject to this section, where any person is a holder or an issuer of a financial arrangement, the amount that is deemed to be income or expenditure of that person in respect of the financial arrangement in any income year is an amount calculated using the yield to maturity method so as to result in the allocation to each income year of an amount that is fair and reasonable, and such amount so allocated to each income year is income deemed to be derived by or expenditure deemed to be incurred by the person in respect of the financial arrangement in the income year:

provided that the Commissioner must accept an alternative method to the yield to maturity method, that has regard to the principles of accrual accounting, and—

- (a) conforms with commercially acceptable practice; and
- (b) except to the extent that the Commissioner may otherwise allow under subsection (8), is adopted by the person and is or will be consistently applied in respect of all such financial arrangements for financial report‐ ing purposes; and
- (c) results in the allocation to each income year of amounts that are not materially different from amounts that would be calculated but for this proviso.
- (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), but subject to the other provisions of this section, where in any income year the total value of all financial arrangements of which a person is a holder or an issuer has on no day within that income year exceeded $1,500,000 or such greater amount as the Governor-General may by Order in Council declare for the purposes of this section,—
	- (a) the person may calculate income or expenditure for that income year in respect of those financial arrangements by using the straight-line method so as to result in the allocation to that income year and subsequent income years of amounts that are fair and reasonable in respect of those arrangements; and
- (b) where the straight-line method is used under paragraph (a), that method must be used by the person in respect of all financial arrangements of which the person was the holder or issuer during that income year; and
- (c) where the person has in accordance with this subsection calculated income or expenditure using the straight-line method in respect of a financial arrangement for any income year, the person must, unless the Commissioner notifies them that they are otherwise authorised, continue to use that method in respect of that financial arrangement for any subsequent income year, until the maturity, remittance, sale, or other transfer of the arrangement, notwithstanding that the total value of all financial arrangements of which the person is holder or issuer may at any time in any such subsequent income year exceed $1,500,000 or such other amount as may be declared for the purposes of this section,—

and any amount calculated in respect of a financial arrangement in accordance with this subsection is income deemed to be derived by or expenditure deemed to be incurred by the person in respect of the financial arrangement for the relevant income year.

- (3B) An Order in Council under subsection (3) is secondary legislation (*see* [Part 3](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM7298343) of the Legislation Act 2019 for publication requirements).
- (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), a person must take into account financial arrangements to which subpart EW applies.
- (5) For the purposes of subsection (3),—
	- (a) the value of any financial arrangement to be taken into account in deter‐ mining whether the total value of all financial arrangements of which a person is the holder or issuer on any day exceeds $1,500,000 or such other amount as may be declared for the purposes of this section is,—
		- (i) in the case of a fixed principal financial arrangement, the nominal or face value of the arrangement; and
		- (ii) in the case of a variable principal debt instrument, the amount owing by or to the person under the arrangement on the relevant day; and
		- (iii) in the case of a financial arrangement to which subpart EW applies, the value determined under that subpart; and
	- (b) in the first income year for which income or expenditure is calculated under subsection (3) in respect of a financial arrangement that—
		- (i) was acquired or issued by the person in a previous income year; and
		- (ii) continues to be held or issued by the person at the end of the first income year for which income or expenditure is calculated under subsection (3),—

the amount of income or expenditure of the person in respect of that financial arrangement for that first income year is an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula:

a − b − c + d

where—

- a is the sum of all amounts that would have been income derived by the person in respect of the financial arrangement if the straight-line method referred to in subsection (3) had been applied to the financial arrangement from the date it was acquired or issued by the person until the end of that first income year
- b is the sum of all amounts that would have been expenditure incurred by the person in respect of the financial arrangement if the straight-line method referred to in subsection (3) had been applied to the financial arrangement from the date it was acquired or issued by the person until the end of that first income year
- c is the sum of all amounts of income deemed to have been derived by the person in respect of the financial arrangement before the commencement of that first income year
- d is the sum of all amounts deemed to have been expenditure incurred by the person in respect of the financial arrangement before the commence‐ ment of that first income year;—

and any amount so calculated is, if a positive amount, deemed to be income derived by the person in that first income year and, if a negative amount, deemed to be expenditure incurred by the person in that first income year.

- (6) Where it is not possible to calculate an amount to be deemed to be income or expenditure in respect of a financial arrangement using the yield to maturity method as provided for in subsection (2) or (in a case to which subsection (3) applies) the straight-line method as provided for in subsection (3), the amount that is deemed to be income or expenditure of the person in any income year is an amount calculated by the person—
	- (a) using the method, if any, prescribed by the Commissioner for the finan‐ cial arrangement in a determination made under [section 90(1)(c)](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM353323) of the Tax Administration Act 1994:

provided that the Commissioner must accept an alternative method to the method prescribed in any such determination that has regard to the principles of accrual accounting, and—

- (i) conforms with commercially acceptable practice; and
- (ii) except to the extent that the Commissioner may otherwise allow under subsection (8), is adopted by the person and is or will be consistently applied in respect of all such financial arrangements for financial reporting purposes; and
- (iii) results in the allocation to each income year of amounts that are not materially different from the amounts that would be calcula‐ ted, but for this proviso; and
- (b) in the absence of any such determination, by applying a method that meets the requirements of subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of the proviso to paragraph (a) and that results in the allocation to each income year of an amount that, having regard to the tenor of subsection (2), is fair and reasonable;—

and such amount of income or expenditure so allocated to each income year is income deemed to be derived or, as the case may be, expenditure deemed to be incurred by the person in the income year.

- (7) Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (6), the Commissioner must accept an alternative method for calculating the amount to be deemed to be income or expenditure of the person, in respect of a financial arrangement, to the methods provided for under subsections (2) and (6), if the alternative method has regard to market valuation, and—
	- (a) conforms with commercially acceptable practice; and
	- (b) except to the extent that the Commissioner may otherwise allow under subsection (8), is adopted by the person and is or will be consistently applied in respect of all such financial arrangements for financial report‐ ing purposes; and
	- (c) either—
		- (i) the business of the person comprises dealing in such financial arrangements; or
		- (ii) the financial arrangement is a forward or future contract for for‐ eign exchange, or a futures contract; and
	- (d) the market, the method, and the source of the information used to deter‐ mine the market values have been approved by the Commissioner under a determination issued under [section 90(1)(e)](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM353323) of the Tax Administration Act 1994; and
	- (e) the person and any other person who is a holder (where the person is an issuer) or an issuer (where the person is a holder) of the financial arrangement are not associated persons;—

and such amount of income or expenditure so calculated is income deemed to be derived or, as the case may be, expenditure deemed to be incurred by the person in respect of the financial arrangement in the income year:

provided that where income or expenditure in respect of a financial arrange‐ ment has been calculated by a person under this subsection, income or expend‐ iture in respect of that financial arrangement must, except as otherwise allowed under subsection (8), continue to be calculated on that basis by that person until the maturity, remittance, sale, or other transfer of the arrangement.

- (8) Where a method of calculating income or expenditure in respect of a financial arrangement fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of the proviso to subsection (2) or subparagraph (ii) of the proviso to subsection (6)(a) or (7)(b) by virtue of the fact that the method is not or will not be consistently applied by a person in respect of all such financial arrangements for financial reporting purposes, that method is nevertheless deemed to meet the relevant one of those provisions where the method—
	- (a) appropriately reflects the dominant purpose for which the person acquired or issued the financial arrangement (or each such arrangement); and
	- (b) has been and will be consistently applied by the person in respect of the particular financial arrangement (or each such financial arrangement) for the purposes of the old financial arrangements rules for every income year during its term (except to the extent that the Commissioner appro‐ ves or may approve a change in method under the circumstances or conditions specified in a determination under [section 90(1)(f)](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM353323) of the Tax Administration Act 1994); and
	- (c) is not adopted for purposes that include the purpose of tax avoidance; and
	- (d) has been approved by the Commissioner for adoption in the circum‐ stances applicable to the taxpayer either by notice to the taxpayer or in a determination issued under [section 90](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM353323) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.
- (9) Subsections (2) to (7) do not apply—
	- (a) to a cash basis holder; or
	- (b) in relation to a financial arrangement and a person, in any income year where section EZ 38 applies to that person and to that financial arrange‐ ment; or
	- (c) in relation to a financial arrangement where—
		- (i) the financial arrangement is held by a trustee upon trust for the management of compensation paid for personal injury where that compensation is paid under the Workers Compensation Act 1956 or the Accident Compensation Act 1972 or the Accident Compen‐ sation Act 1982 or the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 or the [Accident Compensation Act 2001](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM99493) or an order of court; and
		- (ii) the trustee is, or if it were a natural person would be, a cash basis holder in respect of the financial arrangement.
- (10) For the purposes of this section, the Commissioner may determine whether and to what extent any issuer or class of issuers is not required to comply with this

section in relation to expenditure incurred or income derived in respect of any class of financial arrangements, having regard to—

- (a) the nature and amount of the expenditure incurred or income derived by the issuer or class of issuers in respect of financial arrangements of that class; and
- (b) the costs of the issuer or class of issuers in complying with this section in relation to the class of financial arrangements; and
- (c) whether, in respect of that issuer or class of issuers and that class of financial arrangements, the application of the discretion given to the Commissioner under this subsection would result in a material difference in the amount of deductions or income allocated to any income year, in relation to the amount that would have been allocated had the discretion not been exercised.
- (11) The Commissioner may at any time cancel any determination made in respect of any person or class of persons under subsection (10).

		- (A) using, at the option of the person, either the yield to matur‐ ity method or the straight-line method referred to in sec‐ tion EZ 35(3) (regardless of whether or not the person is entitled or has opted to use that method) or in accordance with subpart EW, as the case may be, or, where it is not possible to calculate an amount of income or expenditure in respect of the financial arrangements by using either of those methods, an alternative method approved by the Commissioner; and
		- (B) under either section EW 31 or EZ 38—

- (3) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1), the Commissioner may,—
	- (a) where the Commissioner is satisfied, having regard to the tenor of sec‐ tion EZ 35(2), that treatment of a class of financial arrangements other than under section EZ 35 results in a fair and reasonable allocation of income or expenditure among income years, deem natural persons to be cash basis holders in respect of such financial arrangements; and
	- (b) where the Commissioner is satisfied that a class of financial arrange‐ ments has been structured and promoted with the objective of postpon‐ ing any liability to income tax which would have arisen had those financial arrangements not been so structured, deem natural persons not to be cash basis holders in respect of such financial arrangements.
- (4) In any income year where a person who was a cash basis holder in the previous income year ceases to be a cash basis holder, the person must take into account, in calculating income or deductions for the income year, an accruals basis adjustment, in respect of every financial arrangement (other than arrangements that are already dealt with according to section EZ 35 or in respect of which the Commissioner has exercised the discretion given under subsection (3)(a)) acquired in a previous income year and held by the person at the end of the income year equal to an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula:

$$\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{d}$$

where—

- a is the sum of all amounts which would have been income derived by the person in respect of the financial arrangement from the date it was acquired to the end of the income year if the person had not been a cash basis holder at any time during that period
- b is the sum of all amounts that would have been deductions of the per‐ son in respect of the financial arrangement from the date the financial arrangement was acquired to the end of the income year if the person had not been a cash basis holder at any time during the period
- c is the sum of all amounts of income of the person in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired to the end of the previous income year
- d is the sum of all amounts that have been deductions of the person in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired to the end of the previous income year;—

- (5) In any income year where a person who was not a cash basis holder in the previous income year becomes a cash basis holder, that person may take into account, in calculating income or deductions for the income year, a cash basis adjustment, in respect of every financial arrangement (other than arrangements already treated on a cash basis) acquired in a previous income year and held by the person at the end of the income year, equal to an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula:

$$\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{d}$$

where—

- a is the sum of all amounts which would have been income derived by the person in respect of the financial arrangement from the date it was acquired to the end of the income year if the person had been a cash basis holder in respect of the financial arrangement for the whole of that period
- b is the sum of all amounts which would have been deductions of the person in respect of the financial arrangement from the date the financial arrangement was acquired to the end of the income year if the person had been a cash basis holder in respect of the financial arrangement for the whole of the period
- c is the sum of all amounts treated as income of the person in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired to the end of the previous income year
- d is the sum of all amounts that have been deductions of the person in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired to the end of the previous income year;—

and, where the cash basis adjustment has been taken into account, the person must not take into account any other amount in respect of any such financial arrangement in the income year except those calculated under the cash basis adjustment:

provided that the person is deemed not to be a cash basis holder in relation to any financial arrangement in respect of which the person does not take into account a cash basis adjustment.

- (6) The amount of the accruals basis adjustment or the cash basis adjustment in respect of any financial arrangement and any income year is,—
	- (a) where it is a positive amount, income deemed to be derived by the holder in the income year; and
	- (b) where it is a negative amount, deemed to be a deduction of the holder in the income year.
- (7) For the purposes of subsection (1), but subject to subsections (8) and (9),—
- (a) all income in respect of financial arrangements that is trustee income or beneficiary income under the trust rules is disregarded, as is the value of all such financial arrangements producing such income; and
- (b) no person who holds such financial arrangements is a cash basis holder in relation to such financial arrangements.
- (8) Subsection (7) does not apply to financial arrangements held on a bare trust, or to income in respect of such financial arrangements, and the financial arrange‐ ments held and the income derived by the trustees is treated as being held or, as the case may be, derived by a beneficiary of the trust to the extent of the beneficiary's share of the beneficial interest in the financial arrangement.
- (9) Where a deceased person was at the time of his or her death a cash basis holder,—
	- (a) nothing in subsection (7) or in any requirement under this section that a cash basis holder be a natural person, in respect of the income year in which the death occurred and in each of the 4 immediately succeeding income years, applies to prevent the trustee of the estate of the deceased person from being a cash basis holder for the purposes of this Act in respect of financial arrangements issued or held by the estate, where the estate would otherwise qualify as a cash basis holder under this section; but
	- (b) if at any time during those income years the estate ceases to so otherwise qualify as a cash basis holder, it does not again qualify to become a cash basis holder by operation of paragraph (a);—

and for the purposes of subsections (4) and (5), any trustee of an estate who is a cash basis holder under this subsection is deemed to be the same person as the deceased cash basis holder.

- (10) An Order in Council under subsection (1) is secondary legislation (*see* [Part 3](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM7298343) of the Legislation Act 2019 for publication requirements).

## **EZ 51 Transitional adjustment when changing to financial arrangements rules**

- (1) A person may elect to apply the financial arrangements rules to a financial arrangement to which the old financial arrangements rules apply.
- (2) A person who makes an election must apply the financial arrangements rules to all financial arrangements to which the person is a holder or an issuer.

- (5) A person who makes an election must calculate a transitional adjustment for the income year of election and return the resulting income or expenditure.
- (6) The transitional adjustment is calculated using the formula—

income (financial arrangements rules)

- − expenditure (financial arrangements rules)
- − income (old financial arrangements rules)
- + expenditure (old financial arrangements rules)

where—

**income (financial arrangements rules)** is the total amount of income that would be derived by the person from the financial arrangement if the financial arrangements rules were applied to the financial arrangement for the period beginning on the date the person acquires the arrangement and ending on the last day of the income year in which this calculation is made

**expenditure (financial arrangements rules)** is the total amount of expend‐ iture that would be incurred by the person under the financial arrangement if the financial arrangements rules were applied to the financial arrangement for the period beginning on the date the person acquires the arrangement and ending on the last day of the income year in which this calculation is made

**income (old financial arrangements rules)** is the total amount of income of the person from the financial arrangement in all income years before the income year in which this calculation is made

**expenditure (old financial arrangements rules)** is the total amount of expenditure incurred by the person under the financial arrangement in all income years before the income year in which this calculation is made.

- (7) The result of the transitional adjustment is,—
	- (a) if a positive amount, income derived by the person in the income year; and
	- (b) if a negative amount, expenditure incurred by the person in the income year.
- (8) In the income year in which the transitional adjustment is made to a financial arrangement, a person must take into account only the income derived or the expenditure incurred as a result of the adjustment for the financial arrangement.
- (9) Despite subsections (2) to (8), a person is treated as transferring a financial arrangement at market value at the end of the income year of election and must calculate a base price adjustment under section EZ 38 if—
	- (a) the financial arrangement is an arrangement to which the old financial arrangements rules apply; and
	- (b) the financial arrangement were entered into on or after 20 May 1999 and would not have been subject to the financial arrangements rules; and
	- (c) the person elects to apply the financial arrangements rules to a financial arrangement to which the old financial arrangements rules apply. Compare: 2004 No 35 s [EZ 48](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/pdflink.aspx?id=DLM261359)

# **EZ 52 References to new rules include old rules**

- (1) Subsection (2) applies if—
	- (a) the old financial arrangement rules apply to a financial arrangement (**old financial arrangement**); and
	- (b) a taxation law in this Act (**rewritten law**) refers only to, or applies only to, a financial arrangement to which the financial arrangements rules apply; and
	- (c) the rewritten law is in neither subpart EW nor sections EZ 33 to EZ 51; and
	- (d) the rewritten law corresponds to and replaces, with or without amend‐ ments, a taxation law that applied to the old financial arrangement before 20 May 1999.
- (2) The rewritten law applies to the old financial arrangement as if the rewritten law referred to, or applied to, a financial arrangement to which the old financial arrangements rules apply.
- (3) Subsection (2) does not apply to—
	- (a) a definition, or parts of a definition, in section YA 1 if that definition or part refers to section EZ 48; or
- (b) section GB 21, because the former taxation law to which it corresponds has been re-enacted as section EZ 50.
- (4) Section FM 8(3)(b)(ii) applies to a financial arrangement to which the old financial arrangements rules apply as if—
	- (a) the reference to section EW 31 were to section EZ 38; and
	- (b) the words "financial arrangements rules" read "old financial arrange‐ ments rules".

#### **EZ 53 How expected death strain is calculated**

*Calculation of expected death strain: steps*

- (1) For an income year, the life insurer calculates their expected death strain by following these steps:
	- (a) first, use the relevant expected death strain formula to calculate an amount for each life insured under each life insurance policy existing at the start of the income year (*see:* subsections (2) and (3) for guidance on the relevant expected death strain formula):
	- (b) second, for each such life insurance policy, add together the amounts for the lives insured under it:
	- (c) third, add together the totals reached under paragraph (b).

*Expected death strain formula (life)*

- (2) Section EZ 54(1) sets out the expected death strain formula (life). This is the formula a life insurer uses for an income year, to calculate an amount for a life insured under a life insurance policy, except to the extent to which an annuity is being paid under the policy at some time in the income year.
*Expected death strain formula (active annuities)*

- (3) Section EZ 54(2) sets out the expected death strain formula (active annuities). This is the formula a life insurer uses for an income year, to calculate an amount for a life insured under a life insurance policy, to the extent to which an annuity is being paid under the policy at some time in the income year.

#### **EZ 54 Expected death strain formulas**

*Expected death strain formula (life)*

- (1) The expected death strain formula (life) is—
claim probability × (opening sum assured − opening actuarial reserves). *Expected death strain formula (active annuities)*

- (2) The expected death strain formula (active annuities) is—
claim probability × opening actuarial reserves.

*Definition of items in formulas*

- (3) The items in the formulas are defined in subsections (4) to (6).
*Claim probability*

- (4) **Claim probability** is the probability of a claim arising under the policy for the life insured's death in the income year. It is determined at the start of the income year using the same mortality assumptions as are used to calculate the life insurer's actuarial reserves at the start of the income year. It is expressed as a decimal. Variations to **claim probability** are in sections EZ 55(2) and EZ 57(2).
*Opening sum assured*

- (5) **Opening sum assured** is the claim that would be payable under the policy for the life insured's death in the income year or, if no such claim would be payable, the claim that would be payable under the policy for the life insured's survival to the relevant date or age specified in the policy. It is determined at the start of the income year. It may be zero. Variations to **opening sum assured** are in sections EZ 56(2), EZ 57(3), and EZ 58(2).
*Opening actuarial reserves*

- (6) **Opening actuarial reserves** is the amount in the life insurer's actuarial reserves for the life insured under the policy. It is determined at the start of the income year.

#### **EZ 55 Expected death strain formulas: option when more than 1 life insured**

*When this section applies*

- (1) This section applies when a life insurance policy covers more than 1 life insured.
*Claim probability*

- (2) In using the relevant expected death strain formula, the life insurer may use as **claim probability** a common factor for all the lives insured under the policy.
#### *Features of common factor*

- (3) The common factor must be a reasonable approximation of the average prob‐ ability of a claim arising under the policy for each life insured's death in the income year. It must be weighted as necessary to take account of—
	- (a) differing claims for individual lives insured under the policy; and
	- (b) differing amounts in the life insurer's actuarial reserves for individual lives insured under the policy.
