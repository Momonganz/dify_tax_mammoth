Under the terms of the trust, Alice forfeits, for no consideration, any contingent interest or beneficial ownership in the shares if she leaves the employ of Acme Limited within 3 years of the transfer of the shares to the trustee. Alice stays for 3 years, and, under the terms of the trust, the shares are transferred absolutely to her on her 3rd anniversary of employment. It is a material risk, for the 3 years after the transfer to the trustee, that the terms of the trust will operate to forfeit any contingent interest or beneficial ownership in the shares.
