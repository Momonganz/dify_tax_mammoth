# Clubs or similar institutions

A club or similar institution is a not-for-profit association or society formed for social, recreational or leisure purposes.

Members of clubs or similar institutions are persons who are entitled to vote at the general meeting of the body, where they exercise effective control over the affairs of the club or similar institution.

## Tax treatment of clubs or similar institutions

**Where 50% or more of the gross receipts on revenue accounts a** **re from members**, you are **not** **deemed to be carrying on a business**
and will not be taxed on income arising from your club's operations. However, you will be taxed on **income from** **other sources** derived from dealings with non-members such as interest, rent and dividends.

**Where less than 50% of the gross receipts on revenue accounts are from members**, you are
**deemed to be carrying on a business.** You will be taxed on your operating surplus (total receipts of income less tax-deductible operating expenses), as well as the income from other sources derived from dealings with non-members
such as interest, rent and dividends.

| **Proportion of gross revenue receipts received from members** | **Tax treatment** |
| ≥50% | Not deemed to be carrying on a business:<br>- Gross revenue receipts from operating activities are not taxable<br>- Other sources of income derived from dealings with non-members are taxable |
| <50% | Deemed to be carrying on a business:<br>- Operating surplus (gross revenue receipts less tax-deductible expenses) is taxable<br>- Other sources of income derived from dealings with non-members are taxable |

## How to track income from voting / non-voting members

Use this  [spreadsheet](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/xls/spreadsheet-for-tracking-receipts-ca.xls?sfvrsn=c7a8eab8_2 "Spreadsheet for tracking receipts - CA") (29 KB) to tabulate the source of revenue receipts from voting and non-voting members and determine if your club satisfies the 50% requirement under section 11(1) of the Income Tax Act.

# Trade associations

A trade association refers to a body of traders, businessmen or professionals who come together to promote and protect the common interest of the group.

Members of trade associations are persons who are entitled to vote at the general meeting of the body, where they exercise effective control over the affairs of the trade association.

The following types of members are considered Singapore trade association members:

1. Persons, other than companies, resident in Singapore
2. Companies incorporated in Singapore (excluding branches or offices located outside Singapore)
3. Branches or representative offices of foreign companies (i.e. companies incorporated outside of Singapore) located within Singapore

## Tax treatment of trade associations

When **more than 50% of your receipts** **derived through entrance fees and subscriptions** from Singapore members are claimable as tax-deductible expenses **1**, you are deemed to be carrying on a business.
You will be taxed on your operating surplus (total receipts of income less tax-deductible operating expenses) and other sources of income. However, income from transactions with foreign members is not subject to tax.

When **less than 50% of your receipts** **derived through entrance fees and subscriptions** from Singapore members are claimable as tax-deductible expenses, you will only be taxed on income from transactions with non-members.

\\_\\_\\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1 Subscription fees are generally claimable as tax-deductible expenses for Singapore members, while entrance fees are capital in nature, and are not claimable as tax-deductible expenses. Thus, the formula for the determination of tax treatment
is:

**Subscriptions received from Singapore members ÷ Entrance fees and subscriptions received from Singapore members**

| **Proportion of entrance fees and subscriptions from Singapore members that are claimable as tax deductions** | **Tax treatment** |
| ≤50% | Only income derived from dealings with non-members are taxable |
| >50% | Deemed to be carrying on a business:<br>- Operating surplus (gross revenue receipts less tax-deductible expenses) is taxable<br>- Income derived from transactions with foreign members are not taxable<br>- Other sources of income derived from dealings with non-members are taxable |

Subscriptions received from Singapore members ÷ Entrance fees and subscriptions received from Singapore members

= 16.7%

Trade Association DEF is not deemed to be carrying on a business because less than 50% of the entrance fees and subscriptions received from Singapore members are claimable as tax deductions. In this case, only income derived from non-members are subject
to tax.

Note: any losses incurred by the trade association will be disregarded, and cannot be carried forward, as the trade association is not deemed to be carrying on a business.

# Management corporations

A management corporation (MC) is set up by the legal owners of a strata development (e.g. condominiums and shopping complexes) under the Building Maintenance & Strata Management Act 2004 to provide for the proper maintenance and operation of the building and the common areas.

The subsidiary proprietors2 share the cost of maintenance, insurance, and any other common expenses by making contributions to the funds which are managed by the MC.

\\_\\_\\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2 Subsidiary proprietors are purchasers to whom a developer has transferred ownership of a unit in the strata development.

## **Tax treatment of management corporations**

An MC is regarded as a taxable body of persons separate from the subsidiary proprietors or flat owners. The tax treatment of an MC is the same as a club or similar institution.

# Town Councils

Town Councils are established under the Town Council Act to control, manage, maintain and improve the common property in housing estates.

## **Tax treatment of town councils**

Town Councils are taxable persons separate from the tenants and owners of properties in the housing estate.

The tax treatment of various payments depends on:

(a) Whether the income is received from residents/owners of the properties in the town; and

(b) Whether the income is received for the common purpose for which the Town Council is established.

| Taxability | Income derived from | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Taxability** <br>Not subject to tax | **Income derived from** Residents/owners of properties in the town | **Examples** <br>Fees received for the common purpose for which the town council is established such as:<br>- Service/conservancy charges/fees for maintaining and using common property of residential and commercial properties as defined in the Town Council Act<br>- Fees, rents and other charges for the maintenance and use of season car parks lots, market/food centres and industrial properties if the town council opts to maintain and manage such properties <br>- Operating fees paid by HDB for the maintenance of HDB's carpark |
| **Taxability, Taxability** Subject to tax | **Income derived from** Residents/owners of properties in the town | **Examples** <br>Fees received for other services performed that are not aligned with the common purpose for which the town council is established such as:<br>- Agency fees paid by HDB for acting as collecting agent on behalf of HDB |
| **Income derived from** Third parties who are not residents/owners of properties in the town | **Examples** <br>- Fees, rents, and other charges in the town for the maintenance and use of non-season car parks lots, market/food centres and industrial properties where the town council opts to manage and maintain these properties<br>- Agency fees derived from acting as agents for other town councils<br>- Liquidated damages received from contractors for poor performance of service agreement<br>- Grants received from the HDB/Government to enable the town council to perform mandatory and non-mandatory functions<br>- Income derived from investing monies from sinking funds |

Where a town council receives payments that are not within the examples listed above, clarification should be sought from IRAS as to their taxability.
