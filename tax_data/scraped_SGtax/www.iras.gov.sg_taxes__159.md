Employers are responsible for reporting the employment income of all individuals who have worked for them. If an employee has changed jobs during the year, each employer is required to submit income information for the period the employee was under its employment. This applies to all employers with whom the employee has had an employment contract, regardless of the duration of employment.

In cases where employees are transferred from one entity to another entity due to a change of constitution of the employer (e.g., a company restructuring or merger) during the year, the employer may either:

1. Submit information under the respective entity according to the contract periods, or
2. Combine the employees’ employment income information under the new entity.

## Employers under Auto-Inclusion Scheme (AIS) for Employment Income

Employers specified under paragraph 4 of the [gazette](https://www.iras.gov.sg/docs/default-source/individual-income-tax/employers/s68(2)-gazette-ya-2025.pdf?sfvrsn=6ddad16d_4 "govt gazette (from egovt website) (pdf)") (PDF, 128 KB) must submit their employees’ income information to IRAS electronically by 1 Mar of the year after the year the income is derived by the employee.

The information submitted by employers will be pre-filled in employees' electronic Income Tax Returns. AIS employers do not need to issue hardcopy Form IR8A and the appendices to their employees.

Learn more on [Auto-Inclusion Scheme (AIS) for Employment Income](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/employers/auto-inclusion-scheme-(ais)-for-employment-income).

## Employers not under Auto-Inclusion Scheme (AIS) for Employment Income

Employers who are not under the AIS will have to provide the hardcopy Form IR8A and appendices (where applicable) to their employees by 1 Mar of the year after the year the income is derived by the employee so that the employees could file their Income Tax Returns with the information. Employers need not submit the forms to IRAS.
