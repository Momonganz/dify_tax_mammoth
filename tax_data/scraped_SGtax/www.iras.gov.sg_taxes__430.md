## CRS Filing Requirements

Under the CRS Regulations, a Reporting SGFI is required to submit annual CRS return(s) to IRAS setting out the required information in relation to every Reportable Account that is maintained by the SGFI. Reporting SGFIs that did not maintain any Reportable
Accounts in the relevant reporting year are required to file a nil return to IRAS.

## Due Date for Filing

All Reporting Singaporean Financial Institution (SGFIs) must submit their CRS returns, including nil returns (if applicable) by **31 May** of the year following the calendar year to which the return relates.

[**Example on deadline to register and submit CRS return**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/international-tax/common-reporting-standard-(crs)/crs-filing#example-on-deadline-to-register-and-submit-crs-return)

Company A was incorporated in Mar 2019. In Feb 2020, the company obtained the Capital Markets Service (CMS) licence under the Securities and Futures Act 2001 from MAS and became a Reporting SGFI as it has met its definition of an investment entity under Regulation 7(1)(a) of the CRS Regulations. Company A is required to register for CRS with IRAS before 31 Mar 2021 and needs to submit its CRS return for its first Reporting Year 2020 to IRAS by 31 May 2021.

## Penalties for Late Filing

Reporting SGFIs may face enforcement actions, including a penalty of up to $5,000, for late or non-filing of their CRS returns.

## Requesting for Filing Extensions

All Reporting SGFIs need to plan their resources to submit their CRS returns on time.

As five months after the end of the reporting period is a reasonable deadline, no extensions will be granted.

No extensions will be granted, except for newly registered Reporting SGFIs and for circumstances that fall within the list of acceptable reasons below.

| Acceptable Reasons | Maximum extension granted |
| Newly registered Reporting SGFI (1st return) | 1 month |
| Breakdown of IT system or Change of IT software/ system | 2 weeks |
| Key personnel handling CRS filing is on unexpected long medical leave | 2 weeks |

**No extensions** will be granted for the following reasons.

| Reasons that are not acceptable |
| Not enough manpower to handle CRS matters |
| Key personnel overseas or resigned without proper handover |
| New staff does not know how to handle CRS matters |

## Simplified CRS Registration and Filing Requirements for Qualifying Personal Investment Companies (PICs)

PICs that are liable to register for CRS and have reporting obligations should file their annual returns via myTax Portal.  However, a Qualifying PIC, that is, a PIC that does not have a tax reference number (e.g. UEN, ASGD or ITR Number) and meets
all the following criteria below may qualify for simplified CRS registration and reporting requirements:

1. the PIC is incorporated overseas and is a tax resident in Singapore;
2. the PIC qualifies for S13F and S13N exemptions under the Income Tax Act 1947;
3. the PIC is 100% owned by a SGFI; and
4. the PIC does not maintain any reportable accounts as defined in the CRS Regulations

Qualifying PICs may file its CRS return annually using the [simplified AEOI registration and reporting form](https://go.gov.sg/iras-simplified-aeoi-registration-and-filing-for-qualifying-pic "simplified AEOI registration and reporting form").

## How to submit a CRS return

From 11 Apr 2021, you will be required to log in to government digital services for businesses (G2B) using Singpass instead of Corppass. For more information, visit [Corppass](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/cpauth/login/homepage?URL=%2F&TAM_OP=login "Corppass") website.

**Step 1: Authorise users for CRS Filing**

Before filing the CRS returns, please ensure that you have been authorised by the Reporting SGFI as an “Approver” for Automatic Exchange of Information (CRS and FATCA) Digital Services in Corppass. In authorising "Approver" in Corppass, Corppass Admin should leave the "Effective Reporting Year From" and "Effective Reporting Year To" fields as blank for the "Approver" to enable the "Approver" to submit returns for all Reporting Years.

For Non- UEN entities (e.g. Singaporean/foreign trusts or funds), the entity would have to first appoint a Corppass Admin via this [link](https://form.gov.sg/5b90a2cb407059000fa734f2).

In addition to the steps above on the AEOI Digital Services authorisation, the Corppass Admin would also have to authorise the user as an "Approver" for the "For non-UEN entities only" Digital Services in order to access the AEOI services on myTax Portal. For more details, please refer to the [guide](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/corppass-step-by-step-update-for-non-uen-entities.pdf?sfvrsn=f455e8e3_5 "Corppass Step by Step update for Non-UEN entities"). For assistance on Corppass setup, please refer to the [step-by-step guides](https://www.iras.gov.sg/digital-services/others/corppass).

## List of Reportable Jurisdictions

**Why do I need to know the list of Reportable Jurisdictions?**

Under the CRS Regulations, Reporting SGFIs are required to provide IRAS with a return setting out the CRS information of Reportable Accounts that they maintained during the calendar year. Every Reporting SGFI that maintains Financial Accounts that are
not Reportable Accounts is required to file a nil return with IRAS for the relevant reporting year. Reportable Accounts are Financial Accounts that are held by Account Holders and where the Account Holder is a Passive NFE, the Controlling Persons
of the Passive NFE that are tax residents of a Reportable Jurisdiction.
