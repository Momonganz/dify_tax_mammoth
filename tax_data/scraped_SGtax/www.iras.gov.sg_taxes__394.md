A Singapore company that makes a qualifying acquisition of the ordinary shares of another company may enjoy an M&A allowance on the purchase consideration.

## What Qualifies for M&A Allowance

Under the M&A scheme, an M&A allowance is granted to a company ('the acquiring company') that acquires the ordinary shares of another company ('the target company') during the period 1 Apr 2010 to 31 Dec 2025 (both dates inclusive). The M&A
allowance is allowed on a straight-line basis over 5 years and the allowance cannot be deferred.

Companies must meet certain conditions to remain eligible for M&A allowance for each Year of Assessment (YA) during the 5-year writing-down
period.

## Double Tax Deduction on Transaction Costs

Under the M&A scheme, double tax deduction is granted on transaction costs incurred on qualifying share acquisitions completed during the period **17 Feb 2012 to 31 Dec 2025 (both dates inclusive).** For the purpose of allowing a double
tax deduction, the amount of transaction costs is taken net of grants or subsidies from the Government or any statutory board and is subject to an expenditure cap of $100,000.

The cap of $100,000 applies to all transaction costs incurred in relation to qualifying acquisitions of ordinary shares in all target companies, for which the claims for M&A allowance are first made in the same Year of Assessment (YA). This is regardless
of when the transaction costs are incurred.

Transaction costs include legal fees, accounting or tax advisory fees, valuation fees and such other professional fees that are necessarily incurred for a qualifying share acquisition. They do not include professional and incidental fees in
respect of a loan arrangement.

The deduction of the transaction costs is allowed in:

- The YA in which the M&A allowance on the qualifying share acquisition for which the transaction costs are incurred is first claimed; or
- The YA relating to the basis period in which the transaction costs are incurred, whichever is the later.

#### Example

A qualifying share acquisition took place on 1 Mar 2019 and the acquiring company claims M&A allowance in YA 2020 (for the year ending on 31 Dec 2019). The company incurred transaction costs relating to the share acquisition on 1 Mar 2019 as follows:

| YA in which Transaction Costs Were Incurred | Amount Incurred |
| --- | --- |
| **YA in which Transaction Costs Were Incurred** YA 2019 | **Amount Incurred** $10,000 |
| **YA in which Transaction Costs Were Incurred** YA 2020 | **Amount Incurred** $60,000 |
| **YA in which Transaction Costs Were Incurred** YA 2021 | **Amount Incurred** $50,000 |
| **YA in which Transaction Costs Were Incurred** Total | **Amount Incurred** $120,000 |

The following double tax deduction is granted to the company:

**YA 2020**: ($10,000 + $60,000) x 2 = $140,000

**YA 2021**: $30,000\* x 2 = $60,000

_\\* The transaction cost of $50,000 incurred in YA 2021 is restricted to $30,000 (i.e. $100,000 - $10,000 - $60,000). The excess $20,000 (i.e. $120,000 - $100,000) is disregarded._

Transaction costs incurred in relation to a share acquisition completed during the period 1 Apr 2010 to 16 Feb 2012 are not deductible. They also do not form part of the cost of qualifying share acquisition
for determining the amount of M&A allowance.

## Unutilised M&A Allowance & Double Tax Deduction on Transaction Costs

The M&A allowance and double tax deduction on transaction costs cannot be transferred under the Group Relief system.

Likewise, any unutilised M&A allowance and double tax deduction on transaction costs cannot be carried back to set-off the acquiring company's assessable income for the preceding year.

However, the unutilised M&A allowance and double tax deduction on transaction costs may be carried forward for set-off against the acquiring company's future income if the shareholding test is met (i.e. there must be no substantial change in the shareholders
and their shareholdings as at the relevant dates).

The shareholding test for these items works the same as that for unutilised capital allowances. Learn more about the [shareholding test](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/unutilised-items-(capital-allowances-trade-losses-donations)#qualifying-conditions).
