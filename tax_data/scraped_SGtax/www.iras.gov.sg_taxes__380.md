When the payment is **due and payable** under the following scenarios:<br>    <br>   1. Director's fees approved in **arrears**<br>      <br>      For director's fees approved in arrears, the director has already rendered the requisite services for the accounting<br>       year concerned. However, the director's fees must be disclosed to and approved by members of the company before they can be paid to him. Hence, the earliest date on which the director is entitled to the director's fees,<br>       is the date the fees are voted and approved at the company's AGM.<br>   2. Director's fees approved in **advance**<br>      <br>      For director's fees approved in advance, the director may not have rendered the requisite services for the accounting year concerned when the fees are approved at the company's AGM.

| **Common errors** Failing to file WHT when claiming tax exemption under DTR | **What you need to know/ do** <br>You are required to file WHT even if you are claiming tax exemption (i.e. 0% tax rate) under the Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) or Approved Royalties Incentive (ARI).<br>To claim tax relief under the DTA, please select the **Double Taxation Relief** option under the **Relief/ Incentive** section in the WHT form and ensure that the Certificate of Residence (COR) is submitted by<br> the due date. |

Within 3 months from the date of WHT submission if the claim is for preceding calendar years.<br>Therefore, you may file and pay WHT based on the reduced rate available in the relevant DTA and submit the relevant COR subsequently.<br>However, if you are uncertain whether the non-resident will provide you with the COR or whether the non-resident is a tax resident of the DTA treaty country/region, please withhold and pay WHT at the prevailing domestic rate to avoid late<br> payment penalties for underpayment of WHT.
