IRAS will examine all the facts and circumstances giving rise to the payments to determine the nature of the payments in each case. The nature of payments does not simply depend on, and hence is not affected by, the description ascribed to the payments by employers.

Where the components of the retrenchment benefits are taxable, they will be taxed in the year that you are legally entitled to the benefits and not based on the date of payment. It is usually taxed in the year that you are retrenched.
