**Interaction between the MLI and tax agreements**

At the point of ratification of the MLI on 21 December 2018, the list of DTAs that Singapore intends to amend using the MLI can be found [at this link](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/list-of-treaties-notified-under-the-mli-rev1.pdf?sfvrsn=b1644ae6_4) (PDF, 135KB). These DTAs will only be amended if Singapore's treaty partners also choose to amend the DTAs
using the MLI. DTAs that will be amended by the MLI are referred to as Covered Tax Agreements under the MLI.

Signatories to the MLI may choose the provisions in the MLI to adopt and how such provisions should be adopted. A Covered Tax Agreement will be amended only if both treaty partners share the same position on the provisions of the MLI. The agreed changes
to a Covered Tax Agreement will enter into effect after the treaty partner has also ratified the MLI. Singapore's positions on the MLI provisions can be found [at this link](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/singapore's-mli-positions-rev1.pdf?sfvrsn=7dcf1be8_2) (PDF, 355KB).
