Income tax rates depend on an individual's tax residency status. You will be treated as a tax resident for a particular Year of Assessment (YA) if you are a:

1\. Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident who resides in Singapore except for temporary absences; or

2\. Foreigner who has stayed/worked in Singapore:

a. For at least 183 days in the previous calendar year; or

b. Continuously for 3 consecutive years, even if the period of stay in Singapore may be less than 183 days in the first year and/or third year; or

3\. Foreigner who has worked in Singapore for a continuous period straddling 2 calendar years and the total period of stay is at least 183 days\*. This applies to employees who entered Singapore but excludes directors of a company, public entertainers, or professionals.

\*including your physical presence immediately before and after your employment

If you do not meet the conditions stated above, you will be treated as a non-resident of Singapore for tax purposes.

Singapore's personal income tax rates for resident taxpayers are progressive. This means higher income earners pay a proportionately higher tax, with the current highest personal income tax rate at 24%.

To achieve greater progressivity, the top marginal personal income tax rate will be increased with effect from YA 2024. Chargeable income in excess of $500,000 up to $1 million will be taxed at 23%, while that in excess of $1 million will be taxed at 24%; both up from the current rate of 22%.

## Non-resident tax rates

The tax rate for non-resident individuals is currently at 24%. It applies to all income including rental income from properties, pension and director's fees, except employment income and certain income taxable at reduced withholding rates (please see **Withholding taxes on income of non-resident individuals** below).

**New!**From YA 2024, the income tax rate for non-resident individuals (except on employment income and certain income taxable at reduced withholding rates) will be raised from 22% to 24%.
