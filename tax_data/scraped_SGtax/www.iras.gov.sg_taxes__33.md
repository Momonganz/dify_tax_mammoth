Payers must file and pay the WHT to IRAS by the due date.

WHT must be filed even if the payment to a non-resident is exempted under the Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) or Approved Royalties Incentive (ARI).

On this page:

As a payer, you must file and pay WHT to IRAS by the **15th of the second month** from [the date of payment to the non-resident](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/withholding-tax-filing/withholding-tax-filing-and-payment-due-date#title1).

Learn more through our e-Learning video on the [Filing and Payment of WHT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ial0EX5C7cs).

If you are on GIRO for WHT payment, the GIRO deduction date is on the 25th of the month the tax is due. If the GIRO deduction date falls on a weekend or public holiday, the deduction will be made on the next working day.

Refer to your acknowledgement page for payment details after filing WHT.

## Definition of date of payment

The **date of payment** is defined as the **earliest** of the following dates:

### For all payments except director’s fees

1. When the payment is **due and payable** based on the agreement or contract, or the **date of the invoice** in the absence of any agreement or contract (credit terms should not be taken into consideration).
2. When payment is credited to the account of the non-resident or any other account(s) designated by the non-resident
3. The date of actual payment

### For director’s fees

1. When the payment is due and payable under the following scenarios:
1. Director's fees approved in **arrears**



      For director's fees approved in arrears, the director has already rendered the requisite services for the accounting year concerned.
       However, the director's fees must be disclosed to and approved by members of the company before they can be paid to him. Hence, the earliest date on which the director is entitled to the director's fees, is the date the fees are voted
       and approved at the company's AGM.

2. Director's fees approved in **advance**



      For director's fees approved in advance, the director may not have rendered the requisite services for the accounting year concerned
       when the fees are approved at the company's AGM. Hence, the earliest date on which the director can be entitled to the director's fees, is as and when he renders his services.
2. When payment is credited to the account of the non-resident or any other account(s) designated by the non-resident
3. The date of actual payment

## Multiple payments for a single engagement (non-resident professional or public entertainer)

If you have made multiple payments to the **same** non-resident professional or non-resident public entertainer for the **same engagement** within a 60-days period, you can consolidate the various payments into 1 filing and declare
the last payment date as the date of payment to the non-resident professional or public entertainer.

## Late payment penalty

Penalties will be imposed if the WHT is paid to IRAS after [the payment due date or if the GIRO deduction is unsuccessful](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/withholding-tax-payments/late-payment-and-non-payment-of-taxes).

## FAQs

[**Can I consolidate and file my WHT submission?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/withholding-tax-filing/withholding-tax-filing-and-payment-due-date#can-i-consolidate-and-file-my-wht-submission-)

Yes, you can consolidate and file WHT twice a year, on 15 June and 15 December of each year if you are claiming tax exemption (i.e. tax rate is 0%) under the DTA and ARI.

For example:

Your WHT exempted (i.e. tax rate is 0%) payment to a non-resident is due every 15 of the month. Instead of filing for WHT monthly, you can consolidate and file 6 records on 15 June and the remaining 6 records on 15 December.
