## Definition of a board director

A board director is **a member of a company's board of directors**, which is responsible for overseeing the company's management and making important decisions on behalf of the company.

### How about an Executive Director

A board director can also be an executive director, such as a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or Chairman, and be involved in the daily operation of business.

If a non-resident director receives payment as an executive director, it is not subject to withholding tax. Refer to [Overview of Withholding Tax (WHT)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/basics-of-withholding-tax/overview-of-withholding-tax-(WHT) "Overview of Withholding Tax (WHT)") for more information.
