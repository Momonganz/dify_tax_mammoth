The PIC scheme has expired after the Year of Assessment (YA) 2018. Businesses are not allowed to claim PIC benefits on expenditure incurred after the basis period of YA 2018.

On this page:

From 1 Aug 2016, e-Filing of the PIC cash payout application is compulsory for all PIC cash payout applicants (including companies, partnerships and sole-proprietors). Hardcopy applications for PIC cash payout will not be accepted on or after 1 Aug 2016.

## Applying for PIC Cash Payout

### Step 1: Authorise an employee or a third party

Your company or partnership has to first authorise an employee, business owner (director or partner) or a third party, such as a tax agent, for 'PIC Cash Payout' in [Corppass](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/ "Corppass").

The authorisation is a one-off process and the authorised personnel will be able to make PIC cash payout applications for the company or partnership as long as his/ her authorisation remains valid. For assistance on Corppass set up, refer to the
[step-by-step guides](https://www.iras.gov.sg/digital-services/others/corppass).

_Note: Sole-proprietors do not have to be authorised via Corppass._

### Step 2: Prepare information needed to e-File the application and determine the incurred dates for your PIC qualifying expenditure

Before you start e-Filing, get ready the necessary information stated in [Essential Information for completing PIC Cash Payout digital service](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/essential-info_cash-payout-e-service.pdf?sfvrsn=14563f55_9 "Essential Information for Completing PIC Cash Payout digital service")(PDF, 270KB) so that you can complete the application in 1 session. Where applicable, prepare
the hire-purchase template and/or Research and Development claim form.

If you have incurred qualifying expenditure before and after 1 Aug 2016, you need to segregate your claims into 2 categories:

- Expenditure incurred before 1 Aug 2016 - 60% cash payout rate
- Expenditure incurred on or after 1 Aug 2016 to the last day of the basis period for YA 2018 (i.e. the last day of your financial year 2017) - 40% cash payout rate

The cash payout cap remains at $100,000 for a YA. Hence, you may wish to prioritise and claim cash payout for expenditure incurred before 1 Aug 2016 first (at 60%), before those incurred on or after 1 Aug 2016 up to the last day of the basis period
for YA 2018 (at 40%). You may also refer to the following guidance on [determining the dates that expenditure is incurred](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/specific-topics/productivity-innovation-credit-(pic)-scheme/reduction-of-cash-payout-rate-from-1-aug-2016---how-to-determine-the-dates-of-the-expenditure-incurred "determining the dates that expenditure is incurred") for PIC cash payout purposes.

The election to convert qualifying expenditure to a cash payout is **irrevocable**.

### Step 3: e-File PIC cash payout application and relevant forms online

The employee/ third party authorised for 'PIC Cash Payout' can log in to [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx "mytax.iras.gov.sg") to e-File PIC cash payout applications for the company or partnership. A sole-proprietor can log in to [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx "mytax.iras.gov.sg") directly without any Corppass authorisation.

The 'Apply for PIC Cash Payout' digital service only accepts 1 application a day for each quarter or combined quarters of each YA and up to 15 items of expenditure. The minimum qualifying expenditure for each application is **$400.**

- If you are claiming PIC qualifying expenditure of 15 items or less for 1 YA, you may submit a single PIC cash payout application even if the incurred dates straddle 1 Aug 2016. The PIC cash payout digital service will automatically compute the
eligible cash payout rate.
- If your PIC cash payout application consists of more than 15 items for 1 YA, you should submit separate forms on 2 days in the following order to maximise your PIC cash payout conversion cap -
1. First application: for expenditure incurred before 1 Aug 2016
2. Second application: for expenditure incurred on or after 1 Aug 2016

![Example if your PIC cash payout application consists of more than 15 items for one YA](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/assets/example-if-your-pic-cash-payout-application-consists-of-more-than-15-items-for-one-ya.png?Status=Master&sfvrsn=c3dfd83f_1)

_Tip: You may consolidate the items (e.g. by vendor) and provide a detailed breakdown of the consolidated items and their qualifying costs in the description box._

You can submit your cash payout claim any time after the end of your financial quarter, but not later than the Income Tax Return filing due date for the relevant YA.

The PIC cash payout digital service will not accept any application that is submitted before the end of the financial quarter and you will receive an error message if you make such a submission. You can submit your application only after the end of the
financial quarter.

You will receive an instant acknowledgement if the PIC cash payout application is transmitted to IRAS successfully. Hence, there is no need to contact IRAS to ascertain if IRAS has received your application.

## PIC Cash Payout Processing

IRAS strives to disburse the cash payout within **3 months** of receiving your complete application\*. In most cases, IRAS processes the applications **within 6 weeks**.

IRAS selects a sample of applications for audit. For cases selected for audit, IRAS will request further details and supporting documents for review. Submit the requested documents in an envelope labelled clearly with:

- 'PIC - Companies' for companies
- 'PIC - Individuals' for sole-proprietorships and partnerships

We strive to complete the review within 3 months from receiving the complete information. The processing time may take up to 6 months, depending on the complexity of each case.

Do note that IRAS may also select PIC applications for further review, even after disbursing the cash payout.

_\\* An application is considered complete if the form and the relevant documents (i.e. the [Hire Purchase Template](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/xlsx/hp-template.xlsx?sfvrsn=519963bf_9 "hire purchase template") (XLSX, 301KB) and/or the_

## Checking the Status of your PIC Cash Payout Application

audit is completed. This may take up to 6 months, depending on the complexity of each case.

You may view the status of applications made for 2 future YAs, the current YA and the past YA. For example, if you log in on 15 Jun 2016, you can view the status of applications for YAs 2015 to 2018. You will be able to view the status of all applications

[**My company is facing difficulties in e-Filing my Cash Payout.

From 1 Aug 2016, e-Filing of PIC cash payout applications is compulsory and hardcopy application forms will not be accepted on or after this date. Taxpayers are advised to e-File their PIC cash payout applications early before the filing due date of the Income
Tax Return. Refer to our step-by-step user guides for guidance.

[**My company purchased a total of 30 different PIC qualifying items in YA 2017 and the financial year end is 31 Dec.

The PIC cash payout digital services accept only 1 application form (with a maximum of 15 qualifying items) per day.

If you have more than 15 qualifying items and need to e-File more than 1 application, you will need to e-File on different days. Do e-File early as the PIC application can be submitted any time after the end of the quarter or combined quarters, but before
the Income Tax Return filing due date.

[**My business’ financial year ended on 31 Mar 2016 (YA 2017). When can I apply for the cash payout?

From YA 2013, a business can apply for cash payout by submitting the PIC cash payout application any time after the end of its financial quarter(s), but not later than the Income Tax Return filing due date of the relevant YA (15 Apr for sole-proprietorship
and partnership; 30 Nov for company).

In this case, as your financial year ended on 31 Mar 2016, the financial quarters for YA 2017 are:

| Quarter | From | To |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Quarter** Q1 | **From** Apr 2015 | **To** Jun 2015 |
| **Quarter** Q2 | **From** Jul 2015 | **To** Sep 2015 |
| **Quarter** Q3 | **From** Oct 2015 | **To** Dec 2015 |
| **Quarter** Q4 | **From** Jan 2016 | **To** Mar 2016 |

You can submit the application for cash payout after the end of each quarter i.e.:

- Q1: Submit in Jul 2015
- Q2: Submit in Oct 2015
- Q3: Submit in Jan 2016
- Q4: Submit in Apr 2016

You can also combine consecutive quarters for your cash payout application, for example, combine Q1 and Q2 and submit 1 application in Oct 2015, after Q2 has ended.

The due date to submit the application(s) for cash payout is **15 Apr 2017 for sole-proprietorship and partnership; and 30 Nov 2017 for company.**

If your claim for cash payout is approved, you will generally receive the cash payout within 3 months of receipt of the duly completed PIC cash payout application. For instance, if you are claiming cash payout on qualifying expenditure incurred in Q4
(financial quarter from Jan 2016 to Mar 2016) and have submitted the cash payout application on 15 Apr 2016, the cash payout will generally be made by IRAS by 15 Jul 2016 if your claim is approved.

Do note that IRAS selects a sample of applications for audit. For cases selected for audit, IRAS will request further details and supporting documents for review. We strive to complete the review within 3 months from receiving the complete information.
The processing time may take up to 6 months, depending on the complexity of each case.

You can re-submit the cash payout application for the same quarter i.e. Oct 2015 to Dec 2015.

In the application, you should only include claims for the new item i.e. item 3 and not items 1 and 2, which were previously approved. Penalties may be imposed on duplicate claims made.

Alternatively, you can include the claim for item 3 together with your claim for a subsequent quarter in the same financial year, provided you meet the 3-local-employee condition for that subsequent quarter.

You do **not** need to submit the PIC cash payout application together with your company's ECI. If you are claiming the enhanced tax deductions or allowances under PIC, the claim should be made in the tax computation for the relevant
YA.

ECI has to be submitted within 3 months from the company's financial year end.

### For Sole-Proprietorships

[**When can I submit my claim for cash payout if I am a sole-proprietor with multiple sole-proprietorships?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/specific-topics/productivity-innovation-credit-(pic)-scheme/How-to-Apply-for-PIC-Cash-Payout#when-can-i-submit-my-claim-for-cash-payout-if-i-am-a-sole-proprietor-with-multiple-sole-proprietorships-)

A sole-proprietor is only required to submit 1 PIC cash payout application for the multiple sole-proprietorships that have incurred qualifying expenditure. You must submit the application after the financial period of all the businesses have ended.

From YA 2013, businesses can apply for cash payout by submitting the PIC cash payout application after the end of any financial quarter(s) in the business' financial year, but not later than the Income Tax Return filing due date of the relevant YA (15
Apr for sole-proprietorship and partnership).

[**If I have more than 1 sole-proprietorship, how many applications must I submit?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/specific-topics/productivity-innovation-credit-(pic)-scheme/How-to-Apply-for-PIC-Cash-Payout#if-i-have-more-than-1-sole-proprietorship--how-many-applications-must-i-submit-)

You only need to submit 1 application for all your sole-proprietorships as the cash payout is capped at the sole-proprietor level. However, separate annexes for claims relating to each individual sole-proprietorship need to be submitted together with the application.

[**I am not required to file certified statement of accounts for income tax purposes for both my sole-proprietorship and partnership as both businesses have revenue of less than $500,000 each.

For the purpose of claiming cash payout, you are required to submit certified statement of accounts by the income tax filing due date of 15 Apr. This is regardless of whether the revenue of the business is less than $500,000.

However, from YA 2013, sole-proprietorships and partnerships opting for cash payout no longer need to submit certified statements of accounts together with their Income Tax Returns.
