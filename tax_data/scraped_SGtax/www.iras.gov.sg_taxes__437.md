## Gross Gaming Revenue

Casino tax is computed monthly based on the Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) from the games conducted in the casino.

**Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) = A - B**

Where:

**A** is the total amount of **net wins** received on all games conducted within the casino premises of the casino operator; and

**B** is the Goods and Services Tax (GST) chargeable under Goods and Services Tax Act 1993 by the casino operator in respect of all gaming supplies made by the casino operator.

**Gaming supplies** refer to betting and gaming services offered or conducted by a casino operator.

## Net Win

### For games where the casino operator is a party to the wager

Net win is the difference between the amount of bets received by the casino operator on the game and the amount paid out by the casino operator as winnings on the game.

Examples of games under this category are table games and gaming machines where the players play against the casino operator.

### For games where the casino operator is not a party to the wager

Net win is the amount determined by the total value of money or money's worth received by the casino operator for conducting the game.

Examples of games under this category are tournaments and contests where the players compete among themselves for a prize and not against the casino operator.

| Gross Gaming Revenue from | Casino Tax Rate |
| --- | --- |
| **Gross Gaming Revenue from** <br>Premium Players (A premium player is a person who opens a deposit account with the casino operator with a minimum amount of $100,000) | **Casino Tax Rate** <br>5% |
| **Gross Gaming Revenue from** <br>Other Players | **Casino Tax Rate** <br>15% |

## Casino tax rate (Effective from 1 Mar 2022)

| Gross Gaming Revenue (“GGR”) from | Casino Tax Rate at Tier 1 | Casino Tax Rate at Tier 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Gross Gaming Revenue (“GGR”) from** Premium Players (A premium player is a person who opens a deposit account with the casino operator with a minimum amount of $100,000) | **Casino Tax Rate at Tier 1** 8% (for the first $2.4b of GGR in a calendar year) | **Casino Tax Rate at Tier 2** <br>12% (in excess of $2.4b GGR in a calendar year) |
| **Gross Gaming Revenue (“GGR”) from** Other Players | **Casino Tax Rate at Tier 1** <br>18% (for the first $3.1b of GGR in a calendar year) | **Casino Tax Rate at Tier 2** 22% (in excess of $3.1b GGR in a calendar year) |

GGR at Tier 1 casino tax rates apply to a casino operator for any period during the moratorium period (that is, starting 1 March 2022) if the casino operator satisfactorily meets the targets relevant to the development of facilities and services of the casino operator's integrated resort ("Development Targets").

If a casino operator fails to meet its Development Targets, the Tier 2 casino tax rates of 12% and 22% will apply to the GGR derived from premium players and other players respectively for the period during which the casino operator has failed to meet its obligations.
