## Records That Your Company Must Keep

To run a business, it is important to have good record keeping. Companies that adopt good record keeping practices are able to:

- Make better business decisions
- Be aware of the financial status of your company (e.g. profit or loss position, whether there is internal fraud or theft)
- Reduce the cost and effort required to file the Corporate Income Tax Returns, and to reply to IRAS’ queries (if any)

Your company must retain its records (including source documents and bank statements) and be able to explain all transactions relating to its income, business expenses, and purchases. Your company must also keep its accounting records and schedules
which summarise its business transactions in a systematic order.

Refer to the [Record Keeping Checklist](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/record-keeping-checklist.pdf?sfvrsn=b7b13eae_4 "Record Keeping Checklist") (PDF, 61KB) for a summary of the different types of records required.

[**Q1. Can a company discard its records once it has completed its tax filing?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/record-keeping-requirements#q1--can-a-company-discard-its-records-once-it-has-completed-its-tax-filing-)

No, companies are required to retain its records for at least 5 years from the relevant YA.


[**Q2. Can a company keep its records manually in a physical form?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/record-keeping-requirements#q2--can-a-company-keep-its-records-manually-in-a-physical-form-)

Companies are strongly encouraged to keep their records using an accounting software. Using an electronic record keeping system will incur lower manpower costs as the company would not have to manually track each and every business transaction. For source documents (e.g. receipts, invoices, vouchers), the company can keep them either in physical or electronic form.


[**Q3. Is record keeping only for the purposes of fulfilling statutory requirements?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/record-keeping-requirements#q3--is-record-keeping-only-for-the-purposes-of-fulfilling-statutory-requirements-)

Good record keeping practices not only enable a company to reduce the cost and effort required to file tax returns and reply to IRAS’ queries (if any), but also allow a company to make better business decisions and be more aware of its financial status.


[**Q4. Company X only keeps its bank statements as its records. Is this sufficient for record keeping purposes?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/record-keeping-requirements#q4--company-x-only-keeps-its-bank-statements-as-its-records--is-this-sufficient-for-record-keeping-purposes-)

No, keeping only bank statements as records constitute poor record keeping and Company X may face penalties of up to $5,000.

Company X must ensure that it retains its source documents and is able to explain all transactions relating to its income, business expenses, and purchases. For example, source documents such as taxi receipts and travel documents must be retained to substantiate the company’s public transport or overseas travelling expense. Company X must also keep its accounting records and schedules which summarise its business transactions in a systematic order.

[**Q5. If a company purchases a new accounting software, does it need to migrate all the accounting transactions recorded in the existing accounting software to the new accounting software?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/record-keeping-requirements#q5--if-a-company-purchases-a-new-accounting-software--does-it-need-to-migrate-all-the-accounting-transactions-recorded-in-the-existing-accounting-software-to-the-new-accounting-software-)

There is no specific requirement for companies to migrate the accounting transactions recorded in the existing accounting software to the new accounting software.

However, after purchasing the new accounting software, a company must continue to retain and be able to retrieve the accounting transactions that had been recorded in the existing software for at least 5 years from the YA or end of the GST accounting period accordingly. Other business documents associated with these transactional records, such as source documents, accounting records and schedules and bank statements, should be retained as well.
