A mortgage document is a legal agreement where shares are transferred from the borrower to the lender as security for the repayment of a loan.

Mortgage duty is payable on the loan amount granted to the borrower.

## Variation to Mortgage

### Variation to an Open Mortgage

When additional loan is granted and secured under an existing open mortgage on shares, the Stamp Duty payable is the **difference between $500 and the duty previously paid.**

No further duty is payable if the existing open mortgage has been stamped for the maximum amount of $500.

### Variation to a Fixed Mortgage

Where the amount secured under a mortgage of shares is fixed, the mortgage will be stamped based on the fixed amount of the secured loan. This is subject to a **maximum duty of $500.**

When additional loan is subsequently granted and a further mortgage of the same shares is executed to secure the additional loan, the further mortgage is treated as a **fresh security and is liable to full duty**. This is also subject to
the maximum duty of $500.

## Exemption from Stamp Duty for Mortgage

When the shares are used as a security **and** the document is signed under hand, it is exempted from Stamp Duty.

**Example:**

Equitable mortgage is an agreement or a memorandum 'under hand'. This means the agreement is signed but not under seal. Equitable mortgage on shares relates to the creation of a charge on the shares to secure the payment or repayment of money.
