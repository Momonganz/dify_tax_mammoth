The GST treatment for the recovery of expenses from another party such as your employees, customers, related corporations or suppliers, depends on whether the expenses are incurred by you as a principal or as an agent.

On this page:

## Reimbursement and Disbursement

For the purpose of GST, the term "reimbursement" refers to the recovery of an expense that you incur as a principal from another party. A reimbursement may be subject to GST if it is consideration for a supply of goods or services.

On the other hand, the recovery of a payment made on behalf of another party by you as an agent is termed as a "disbursement". A disbursement does not constitute a supply and hence, is not subject to GST.

## GST Treatment of Recovery of Expenses

The following table shows the GST treatment when you recover expenses from another party, including whether you can claim the input tax incurred:

|  | If you have incurred the expenses as a principal | If you have incurred the expenses as an agent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The recovery of expenses is | **If you have incurred the expenses as a principal** <br>a reimbursement | **If you have incurred the expenses as an agent** <br>a disbursement |
| GST treatment | **If you have incurred the expenses as a principal** <br>The recovery of expenses amounts to a supply unless the recovery is compensatory in nature and no goods or services are provided in return to the paying party. If the recovery of expenses amounts to a supply, it is subject to GST unless<br> it qualifies as an exempt supply. | **If you have incurred the expenses as an agent** <br>The recovery of expenses does not constitute a supply and is not subject to GST. |
| Input tax claim | **If you have incurred the expenses as a principal** <br>You are entitled to claim input tax incurred on goods or services procured if the recovery of these expenses constitutes a taxable supply. | **If you have incurred the expenses as an agent** <br>You are not entitled to any input tax claim since the goods or services are not supplied to you but to your principal. |
