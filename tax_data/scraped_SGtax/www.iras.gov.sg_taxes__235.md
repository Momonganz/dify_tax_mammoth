## Tips on Using InteReq

### 1\. Use the Correct and Authorised Property Address

Please ensure that you use the correct and authorised property address when making the search with IRAS.

Example

If the property is a three-storey block allotted with the house numbers 5, 5A, 5B Adam Street, make a search on '5, 5A and 5B Adam Street' respectively and not '5 Adam Street'.

There may be properties which have been re-configured and re-numbered before they are reassessed, thus a search based on the new number might yield misleading results.

### 2\. Use the Property Tax Reference No.

To ensure that the search is carried out on the property that your client intends to buy, search using the Property Tax Reference No. of the property which can be obtained from the existing owner.

### 3\. Access the Latest Statement of Accounts within 93 days

Law firms may request a [Statement of Account (SOA)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/property-tax/property-professionals/lawyer-legal-professional/essential-information-for-lawyers#title3) via
InteReq system if they are subscribers.

Once a  [legal requisition](https://www.intereq.com.sg/lriweb/pfk/PfkMainServlet?pContents=/lri/WalkinUrl.jsp&pAction=FIRST&pPortalId=LRI "legal requisition") is
filed on the property, law firms authorised by the property owners or interested parties can access the latest statement of accounts within 93 days from the date when legal requisition was filed.
