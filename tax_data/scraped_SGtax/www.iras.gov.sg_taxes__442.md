Stamp duty is payable on documents relating to leases of immovable properties in Singapore such as :

- Lease or tenancy agreement

Please note that licence agreements are not subject to stamp duty. Licence agreements are commonly used for the letting out of a food stall in a food court, coffeeshop or hawker centre. If you are unsure if your agreement is a licence or a lease/tenancy, you may wish to seek independent legal advice or submit the document for [adjudication](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/stamp-duty/for-property/other-services/how-to-seek-the-opinion-of-commissioner-on-duty-chargeable-(adjudication)/applying-for-adjudication).

[**Lease with fixed rent**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/stamp-duty/for-property/renting-a-property#lease-with-fixed-rent)

A lease with fixed rental is one for which a fixed rental is agreed upfront for the entire lease period. Stamp duty on the fixed rental is based on lease duty rates.


[**Lease with premium**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/stamp-duty/for-property/renting-a-property#lease-with-premium)

A lease with premium is one for which there is a lump sum payment. Stamp duty is payable on the premium based on the [BSD](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/stamp-duty/for-property/buying-or-acquiring-property/buyer's-stamp-duty-(bsd)) rates. If there is a rental in addition to the premium, stamp duty is payable on the rental based on lease duty rates.


[**Lease with variable rent**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/stamp-duty/for-property/renting-a-property#lease-with-variable-rent)

A lease with variable rental is one for which the rental varies during the lease period.

e.g.

1. Staggered rental for different periods of the lease
2. There is a fixed rental component and an additional rental component based on a percentage of the gross sales turnover (GTO)

In a lease involving an additional rental component based on a percentage of the GTO, you are to estimate the GTO and determine the additional rent payable. This additional rent shall be included for the stamp duty calculation i.e. the rent that is subject
to stamp duty is the sum of the fixed rental (if any) and the additional rental derived from the estimated GTO.

Where the additional rental component is subject to a maximum or minimum secured sum, the additional rent that is subject to stamp duty shall be:

| Types of additional rental component | Additional rent subject to stamp duty |
| --- | --- |
| **Types of additional rental component** Based on a percentage of GTO, subject to a maximum secured sum | **Additional rent subject to stamp duty** The maximum secured sum |
| **Types of additional rental component** Based on a percentage of GTO, subject to a minimum secured sum | **Additional rent subject to stamp duty** The higher of the amount derived from the estimated GTO or the minimum secured sum |

Additional rent subject to stamp duty

Please refer to Examples 1 to 3 below on the calculation of stamp duty for leases involving staggered rental or a percentage of GTO.

[**Variation of lease or supplemental agreement**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/stamp-duty/for-property/renting-a-property#variation-of-lease-or-supplemental-agreement)

If there is an increase in rental or the lease period is extended, stamp duty is payable on the document based on the increase in rental or the rental for the extended lease period.

However, if there is a decrease in rental or the lease period is shortened, stamp duty is not payable for the document.

Other variations where stamp duty is not payable

1. Changing the use of the property with no additional payment;
2. Lifting the restrictions in the lease with no additional payment;
3. Amending the terms of the lease that do not affect the rental and lease term such as addition of an option to renew;
4. Bringing forward or deferring the lease before its commencement without a change in the lease term or gross rent.

Please refer to Examples 4 to 6 below on the calculation of stamp duty for variation of leases.

| **Estimated gross rent per month** | $5,000 + $500 (i.e. the additional rent) + $400 + $100 = $6,000 |
| **Total rent** | $6,000 x 36 months = $216,000 |
| **Stamp duty payable** | 0.4% x $216,000=$864.00 |
