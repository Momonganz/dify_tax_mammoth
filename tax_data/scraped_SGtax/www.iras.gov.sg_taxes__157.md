Under AISS, GST-registered businesses in the aerospace industry enjoy added import GST suspension benefits for qualifying aircraft parts.

On this page:

## Purpose

The Approved Import GST Suspension Scheme (AISS) is designed to alleviate the cash flow of businesses in the aerospace industry.

These businesses are:

1. International airlines;
2. Players in the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) industry;
3. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM); and
4. Distributors of qualifying aircraft parts.

## Benefits of AISS

AISS will allow an approved GST-registered business in the aerospace industry to enjoy import GST suspension in the following scenarios:

1. Import his own goods in the course or furtherance of his business;
2. Import goods belonging to his overseas principal for supply (either in Singapore or for export), as a [section 33(2) agent](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/importing-of-goods/#title9 "section 33(2) agent")\*. The overseas principal must not be GST-registered or if he is GST-registered, the registration is as a pay-only person under the Overseas Vendor Registration (OVR) regime;
3. Import goods belonging to his overseas principal which will subsequently be re-exported, as a [section 33A agent](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/importing-of-goods/#title12 "section 33A agent")\*. The overseas principal must not be GST-registered or if he is GST-registered, the registration is as a pay-only person under the OVR regime;
4. Import qualifying aircraft parts belonging to local or overseas persons;
5. Remove localised or locally sourced qualifying aircraft parts from Airport Logistics Park of Singapore (ALPS) or other Free Trade Zones (FTZ);
6. Remove qualifying aircraft parts from ALPS/FTZ as recipient for the purposes of making his taxable supplies
