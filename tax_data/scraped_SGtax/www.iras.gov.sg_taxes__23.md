## Consequences for late or non-filing of tax returns

Failure to file your Corporate Income Tax Returns together with financial statements and tax computation by the due date is an offence.

IRAS may take the following recovery actions if you fail to file by the due date:

1. Issue an estimated Notice of Assessment. You must pay the estimated tax within 1 month
2. Offer to compound the offence
3. Issue a Section 65B(3) notice to your company director to submit the required information in the Corporate Income Tax Returns to IRAS
4. Issue a Notice to Attend Court/ Summons to the company or persons responsible for running of the company (including the directors)

A [dormant company](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/dormant-companies-or-companies-closing-down/dormant-companies) is still required to e-File the Form for Dormant Company unless it has been granted a [waiver of Corporate Income Tax Return submission](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/dormant-companies-or-companies-closing-down/dormant-companies#title2).

## Estimated Notice of Assessment

IRAS may issue an estimated Notice of Assessment based on your company’s previous years’ income or other available information. When estimating your tax, IRAS may assume an increase in your company's income.

If your company receives an estimated Notice of Assessment, you must:

1. **Pay the estimated tax within 1 month from the date of the Notice of Assessment**



You must pay the estimated tax even if you intend to object to the assessment or are awaiting the outcome of the objection. There will be [penalties for late payment](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-payment/late-payment-or-non-payment-of-corporate-income-tax).

2. **File an objection if you disagree with the estimated tax assessment**



You must [file an objection to the assessment](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/form-c-s-form-c-s-(lite)-form-c-filing/after-filing-form-c-s-form-c-s-(lite)-form-c) within 2 months from the date of the Notice of Assessment.



When filing the objection, you must submit the Corporate Income Tax Returns, financial statements and tax computation. Otherwise, the estimated assessment will not be revised.



If all the documents are submitted, your objection to the estimated tax assessment will be reviewed and any excess tax paid will be refunded.

## Offer of composition

Instead of taking prosecution actions, IRAS may offer your company the option to pay a composition amount.

The composition amount can be up to $5,000 per offence, depending on your company’s past compliance records. A notice will be sent to inform your company of the composition amount. To avoid prosecution, you must pay the composition amount and file
the overdue tax return and documents by the specified due date.

### Paying the composition amount

Quote the payment slip number when paying the composition amount using the preferred [payment modes](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-payment/paying-corporate-income-taxes). GIRO payment is not allowed.

The payment will be processed within 3 working days. To check if your payment has been credited, log in to [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx) and select "View Account Summary".

Legal actions may still be taken against your company if you do not file the outstanding tax return after paying the composition amount. The payment made will be used to settle any unpaid tax.

### Appealing for waiver of composition amount

Appeals can be made online via our [Appeal Penalty Waiver](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/iras/PenaltyWaiver) digital service at [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx).

To complete the appeal for waiver of composition amount request online, you will need the following information:

1. Year of Assessment
2. Authorised appellant's Designation
3. Authorised appellant's Contact number
4. Authorised appellant's Email Address


Appeals will only be considered if:

1. You have submitted the outstanding tax returns and/or documents before the due date stated in the offer of composition\*; and
2. You have filed your tax return on time for the past 2 years.

\*Filing (including accounts, tax computation and additional information where applicable) must be reflected in your tax account.

## Notice to director to request for information under Section 65B(3)

IRAS may issue a Notice to the director of your company under Section 65B(3) of the Income Tax Act. Your company director is required to provide the information requested by the due date stated in the notice, to avoid being summoned to Court.

## Notice to Attend Court/ Summons

A Notice to Attend Court/ Summons may be issued to your company and/or your company directors if IRAS does not receive:

1. The required tax return and/or documents by the due date
2. Payment of the composition amount by the due date

The notice will specify a court date. To avoid attending court, you must complete all of the following actions at least one week before the specified date:

1. File the outstanding tax return and/or documents
2. Pay the composition amount (Quote the payment slip number)

### Postponement of Court hearing

If you need more time to file and/or pay the composition amount, your company's representative, even if he is the director, must attend Court on the specified date indicated in the Notice to Attend Court/ Summons with a Letter of Authorisation to appeal for postponement.

### Attending Court

Failure to attend Court will result in further legal actions taken against your company, potentially including the issuance of a warrant of arrest against the company director.

Should your company be convicted of the offence in Court, your company may face a fine of up to $5,000 for each offence.

If your company director is convicted for failure to comply to Section 65B(3), the director could face a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment of up to 12 months or both, for each offence.

You are still required to file the outstanding tax returns and/or documents. Otherwise, further legal actions may be taken.

### Failure to file your tax returns for 2 or more years

If you fail to file your tax returns for 2 years or more, your company may be issued with a Notice to Attend Court/ Summons. On conviction in Court, for each offence, your company may be ordered to pay:

1. A penalty that is twice the amount of tax assessed; and
2. A fine of up to $5,000.
