Under this scheme, qualifying services performed on qualifying goods in Approved Specialised Warehouses and the lease/ tenancy/ licence of storage space in these warehouses can be zero-rated to overseas persons.

On this page:

## Purpose

The Specialised Warehouse Scheme (SWS) is for warehouses that are used for providing specialised storage facilities to overseas persons and most of the qualifying goods stored will eventually be exported.

A warehouse approved under SWS is known as an "Approved Specialised Warehouse" (ASW).

### Benefits of SWS

The SWS facilitates zero-rating of the following supplies of:

1. Qualifying services (e.g. storage, auction, broking, valuation services) performed on qualifying goods (e.g. works of art, antiques, precious metals and stones) stored in an ASW that are made to and directly benefit overseas persons.

With the introduction of reverse charge from 1 Jan 2020, you may also zero-rate qualifying services supplied to an overseas person where the qualifying services “directly benefit” GST-registered persons belonging in Singapore.

2. A lease/ tenancy/ licence to occupy storage space in an ASW to overseas persons.

This includes the provision of a 'private storage unit' which is generally a supply of goods for GST purposes. Only the operator of an ASW can zero-rate such a supply.


## Qualifying for SWS

Operators of Zero-GST or Licensed warehouses predominantly used for storing qualifying goods may apply for the SWS.

Amongst other eligibility requirements:

1. Most of the goods (at least 90%) stored in the warehouse are qualifying goods stored for overseas persons.
2. Most of the customers (at least 90%) who store goods in the warehouse must be overseas customers; and
3. Most of the qualifying goods (at least 90%) stored for overseas persons that are removed from the warehouse are for export.

The Comptroller of GST will grant approval on a warehouse-by-warehouse basis.
