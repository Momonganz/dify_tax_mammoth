Please refer to the following examples for an illustration of the computation of the Property Tax Rebate.

| Eligibility Period | Scenario and Type of Property Tax Relief |
| --- | --- |
| **Eligibility Period** <br>1 Jan 2020 to 31 Dec 2020 | **Scenario and Type of Property Tax Relief** <br>As part of the Resilience Budget announced on 26 Mar 2020, qualifying non-residential properties (“qualifying properties”) are granted property tax rebate for the period of 1 Jan 2020 to 31 Dec 2020. This is an enhancement<br> of the property tax rebate announced at Budget 2020, on 18 Feb 2020. The property tax rebate is enhanced by extending the rebate to additional types of properties, and increasing the amount of rebate for certain types of properties.<br>Under the Resilience Budget, owners of qualifying properties are granted rebates of up to 100% on their property tax payable. For most properties that are eligible for 100% property tax rebate, this is equivalent to about 1.2 months of<br> rental.<br>Owners of qualifying properties are required to unconditionally and fully pass on to their tenant(s) the rebate for the property tax account that is attributable to the rented property, by either reducing or offsetting current or future<br> rentals or through a payment to their tenant(s), within the prescribed timeframe.<br>Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Act passed on 5 Jun 2020, to provide relief for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs) operating in qualifying non-residential properties, owners of such<br> qualifying properties will be granted Government cash grant. These property owners are required to provide rental relief through a waiver of rent for their eligible SME and NPO tenant-occupiers. Please refer to the Ministry of Law’s<br> website on [Rental Relief Framework](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/rental-relief-framework-for-smes) for more information.<br>Generally, where the Rental Relief Framework applies, the rental waivers may be offset (partially, or otherwise) against any monetary payments or rental reductions provided, or earlier agreed to, by the landlord and the tenants on or after<br> 1 February 2020, as well as any property tax rebate that owners have passed on or are obliged to pass on to their tenants on or before 31 July 2020 in respect of the property. Please refer to the [COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Rental and Related Measures) Regulations 2020](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/COVID19TMA2020-S664-2020?DocDate=20200730 "COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Rental and Related Measures) Regulations 2020") for details.<br> <br>Conversely, where a property owner has satisfied its obligation to provide rental waivers under the Rental Relief Framework, the net amount of rental waiver that has been provided by the property owner under the Rental Relief Framework<br> will also go towards satisfying the property owner’s obligation to pass on the property tax rebate. Please refer to the [COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Transfer of Benefit of Property Tax Remission) Regulations 2020](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/COVID19TMA2020-S375-2020 "COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Transfer of Benefit of Property Tax Remission) Regulations 2020").<br>The rebate is 100% of the property tax payable for:<br>1.
