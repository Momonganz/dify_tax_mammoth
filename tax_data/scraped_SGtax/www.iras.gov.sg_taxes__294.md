## Claiming input tax according to date on tax invoice or import permit

Before making an input tax claim, you must obtain the tax invoice issued by your supplier or import permit, and ensure that all [conditions for claiming input tax](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/conditions-for-claiming-input-tax "conditions for claiming input tax") are satisfied.

The input tax should be claimed in the accounting period corresponding to the **date shown in the tax invoice or import permit**.

You can claim input tax for your purchases before making subsequent supplies of goods or services using these purchases. It is not necessary to match the input tax claim (for purchases) with output tax charged (for subsequent supply) in the same prescribed
accounting period.

You imported a machine in Jun 2021 and sold it to your customer in Aug 2021.

Assuming your financial year ends in Dec and file GST returns on a quarterly basis, you should claim the import GST incurred on the machine in the accounting period 1 Apr 2021 to 30 Jun 2021, based on the date of the import permit. This is despite
you accounting for the output tax on the sale of the machine in the accounting period 1 Jul 2021 to 30 Sep 2021.

## Claiming input tax according to date of posting/processing

You may claim input tax based on the date when you post/process the tax invoice or import permit into your accounting system. However, you must comply with the following requirements:

1. You claim input tax based on the date of posting/processing of the suppliers' tax invoices or import permit into your accounting system consistently for all GST returns;
2. You have the original tax invoices/ import permits at the time of claiming input tax; and
3. There are internal controls in place to ensure that there is no double claiming of input tax.
