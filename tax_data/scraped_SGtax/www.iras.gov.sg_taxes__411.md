Majority of our tax taxpayers declare their taxes correctly. However, a few choose to evade their taxes on purpose. Such behaviour is unfair to those who pay their fair share of tax towards nation building.

## What is Tax Evasion

Tax evasion is when someone has deliberately provided IRAS with inaccurate or incomplete information about their activities to reduce their tax liability or obtain undue tax credits and refunds.

### Examples of evasion in Income Tax:

- failing to declare all assessable income
- claiming deductions for expenses that were not incurred or were not legally deductible
- claiming personal relief on fictitious dependents

### Examples of evasion in GST:

- claiming input tax on fictitious purchases
- omitting output tax charged on local taxable supplies
- claiming tourist refunds when not entitled to

## Signs of Evasion

### Some signs that a person or business may be evading income tax:

- keeping two sets of accounts
- providing false invoices to support fictitious expenses
- not wanting to issue a receipt

- keeping two sets of accounts
- providing false invoices to support fictitious expenses or purchases
- providing false export documents to support zero-rated supplies of goods

However, not all people or businesses who show these signs are deliberately evading tax. By telling us what you know, we can investigate the matter to find out truth and take actions against those who have committed tax offences.

No. You do not have to give us your name when you give us information. However, providing us your name and a contact number allows us to clarify the information furnished, where necessary. If you wish to request for a reward, you will have to provide
your name and contact number at the point of giving us the information and/or documents so that we can contact you to verify your identity.

[**Will my identity remain confidential?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/property-tax/tax-compliance/tax-evasion-or-fraud/reporting-tax-evasion-or-fraud#will-my-identity-remain-confidential-)

Your identity and all information/documents provided will be kept strictly confidential.

Under Section 104A of the Income Tax Act and Section 84A of the Goods and Services Tax Act, witnesses during any civil or criminal proceedings will not be required to disclose information that may lead to the discovery of an informer’s identity. If any document (which is in evidence or liable to inspection in any civil or criminal proceedings) contains any entry in which any informer is named or described or which may lead to the discovery of the informer’s identity, the entry will be concealed from view or removed to protect the informer’s identity. If the court after full enquiry into the case believes that the informer wilfully made a material statement which the informer knew or believed to be false or did not believe to be true; or the court is of the opinion that justice cannot be fully done between the parties to the proceedings without the discovery of the informer, the court may permit enquiry and require full disclosure concerning the informer.

[**Will you let me know what happens to the taxpayer or the status of my tax evasion report?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/property-tax/tax-compliance/tax-evasion-or-fraud/reporting-tax-evasion-or-fraud#will-you-let-me-know-what-happens-to-the-taxpayer-or-the-status-of-my-tax-evasion-report-)

No, we cannot. As there are strict rules on confidentiality under the tax laws, we will not be able to update you on the status of the case or on our investigations on other taxpayers. We will review all cases reported to us and act upon them accordingly.

[**Can I receive immunity from prosecution if I provide information about someone evading tax?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/property-tax/tax-compliance/tax-evasion-or-fraud/reporting-tax-evasion-or-fraud#can-i-receive-immunity-from-prosecution-if-i-provide-information-about-someone-evading-tax-)

If you are merely providing information about someone else evading tax, you will not be prosecuted for tax evasion or for assisting another person to evade tax.

However, we will institute prosecution if we have evidence that you have evaded
tax or have assisted another person to evade tax. Taxpayers who come forward and voluntarily disclose past actions involving wilful intent to evade taxes may be accorded the treatment of having their offences compounded at a reduced penalty rate of
200%, instead of being prosecuted. Please refer to [IRAS' Voluntary Disclosure Programme](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/voluntary-disclosure-of-errors-for-reduced-penalties "IRAS' Voluntary Disclosure Programme") ("VDP") for more details. The decision whether to accord VDP treatments to an informant is made solely at the discretion of the Comptroller.
