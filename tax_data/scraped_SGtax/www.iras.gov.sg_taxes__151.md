### Online Help

Click on the iHelp icon <![i-Help](https://www.iras.gov.sg/images/default-source/icons-png/i(1).jpg?sfvrsn=5a271827_3)\> if you require on-the-spot guidance as you file Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C.

### Pre-filled Information

The following amounts are pre-filled in Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C, where available:

- Unutilised Capital Allowances brought forward
- Unutilised Losses brought forward
- Unutilised Donations brought forward
- Current year Approved Donations
- Unutilised Investment Allowances brought forward (for Form C)

The pre-filled information is based on the carried forward amounts in the last assessment raised by IRAS for the immediate preceding YA. This applies even if the assessment for the immediate preceding YA is under objection or query.

If the return for the immediate preceding YA is under review, the pre-filled information will be based on the carried forward amounts declared in the Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C of the immediate preceding YA.

The amounts are pre-filled for your easy reference and you should verify the accuracy of the information. If there is any discrepancy in the details (i.e. the company’s carried forward amounts in its records differ from the pre-filled records),
you may update the pre-filled amounts in the relevant boxes under ‘Company's Declaration’ (with the exception of current year donations).

* * *

The 250% deduction for donations is granted based on information obtained from the Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs). Upward adjustments are not allowed unless your company adopts a non-Singapore Dollar functional currency. View the details of
the current year approved donation amounts in the [View Donations](https://www.iras.gov.sg/digital-services/companies-tax-agents) digital service at [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx "mytax portal").

If your company has made an approved donation that is not reflected in the [View Donations](https://www.iras.gov.sg/digital-services/companies-tax-agents) digital service, it may be
due to:

- **Differences in receipting date**

The IPC may have recorded your donation in a later financial period and a deduction will be accorded in the corresponding YA.
- **Failure to provide your company’s Unique Entity Number (UEN) to the IPC**

Update your donation record with the IPC and IRAS will amend your assessment when we receive the updated record.

If your company has adopted a non-Singapore Dollar functional currency for the financial period, ensure that the ‘Functional Currency’ in the Corporate Profile Page is updated accordingly. You will then be allowed to key in the Singapore dollar
equivalent amount of your current year donation in the ‘Company’s Declaration’ box.
