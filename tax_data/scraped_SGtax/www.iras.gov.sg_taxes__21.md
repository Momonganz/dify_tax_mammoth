Owners that carry out addition & alteration (A&A) works on their property must submit information on the works to IRAS upon request.

On this page:

## Submit Information to IRAS upon Request

IRAS will reassess your property upon completion of works. Please submit the information in a timely manner when requested.

## Continuation of Owner-Occupier Tax Rate

If the Owner-Occupier Tax Rates are currently applied to your property, it will continue to be applicable on the assumption that you intend to live in the property after A&A or reconstruction works are done. If the property is not intended for your
occupation, you must inform IRAS.

## Deadline for Submission

You must submit the information to IRAS within 21 days from the date of the request. Your architect should be able to assist you.

## Penalty for Non-Compliance

The penalty is a fine of up to $5,000 and an interest on the tax at such rate as may be prescribed (if any).
