[**\#1 I am a visiting professional. Will I be exempt from tax under the short-term employment if I render my services for not more than 60 days in the calendar year in Singapore?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/payments-to-non-resident-professional-(consultant-trainer-coach-etc-)/non-resident-professional-vs-employee#-1-i-am-a-visiting-professional--will-i-be-exempt-from-tax-under-the-short-term-employment-if-i-render-my-services-for-not-more-than-60-days-in-the-calendar-year-in-singapore-)

The tax exemption for short-term employment of 60 days or less applies **only** to employees.

It does not apply to visiting non-resident professionals. However, you may qualify for exemption if you meet the conditions under the
[tax treaty](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/international-tax). Please use our [tax treaty calculator](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/xls/tax-treaty-calculator-(1).xls?sfvrsn=8f77bd04_2 "tax treaty calculator (1)") to check if you are eligible for the tax treaty exemption.

[**\#2 I am engaged on a one-year contract to render services in Singapore. I will be here for a total of three visits of two weeks each. Am I liable to tax in Singapore?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/payments-to-non-resident-professional-(consultant-trainer-coach-etc-)/non-resident-professional-vs-employee#-2-i-am-engaged-on-a-one-year-contract-to-render-services-in-singapore--i-will-be-here-for-a-total-of-three-visits-of-two-weeks-each--am-i-liable-to-tax-in-singapore-)

Your tax liability depends on the capacity in which your services are rendered.

If your services are rendered on behalf of your [foreign employer](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/employees/your-situation/i-am-working-for-foreign-employer#title3),
your income will be exempt for employment exercised in Singapore for 60 days or less in a calendar year.

[Withholding tax](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/basics-of-withholding-tax/types-of-payment-and-withholding-tax-rates) will apply
if you render services here in your own capacity (i.e. you exercise any profession or vocation of an independent nature under contract for service).

[**\#3 My period of engagement is for three years. For each calendar year, I will be in Singapore for 90 days to provide consultancy services as an independent consultant. Can I be considered as a resident of Singapore for income tax purposes based on my total engagement period of three years?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/payments-to-non-resident-professional-(consultant-trainer-coach-etc-)/non-resident-professional-vs-employee#-3-my-period-of-engagement-is-for-three-years--for-each-calendar-year--i-will-be-in-singapore-for-90-days-to-provide-consultancy-services-as-an-independent-consultant--can-i-be-considered-as-a-resident-of-singapore-for-income-tax-purposes-based-on-my-total-engagement-period-of-three-years-)

No. You will be considered as a non-resident professional based on your physical presence in Singapore which is less than 183 days for each of the calendar year.
