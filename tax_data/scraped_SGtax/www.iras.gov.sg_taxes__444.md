Non-cash awards that **do not exceed $200** are considered to be not substantial in value and are **not taxable** due to an administrative concession granted.

If the award exceeds the exemption threshold, the whole value is taxable.The cost incurred by the employer must be declared if the award is taxable.

### Engravings on Awards

When the company engraves its logo on the award, e.g. a watch or a pen, the award is still taxable if it exceeds $200 (substantial in value).
