Under this scheme, Approved Refiners and Approved Consolidators enjoy certain benefits including GST suspension on qualifying imports and additional input tax benefits.

On this page:

## Purpose

The Approved Refiner and Consolidator Scheme (ARCS) is designed to ease cash flow and compliance of qualifying refiners and consolidators of investment precious metals (IPM) in their payment of GST on import and purchase of raw materials and relieve
input tax incurred on refining activities.

Under the scheme, you may be approved as either an Approved Refiner or Approved Consolidator.

The ARCS is intended to complement the GST exemption of IPM announced in Budget 2012.

For details of the GST exemption of IPM, please refer to [GST: Guide on GST Exemption of Investment Precious Metals (IPM)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/gst-guide-on-exemption-of-investment-precious-metals7f0062ff-780a-4a53-90fa-e1f3b1e25770.pdf?sfvrsn=475e50d2_41 "GST : Guide on GST Exemption of Investment Precious Metals (Twelfth Edition)") (PDF, 397KB).

ARCS persons are approved under the scheme as either an Approved Refiner or Approved Consolidator.

## Benefits for Approved Refiners

An Approved Refiner:

1. processes or converts goods into IPM, or extracts IPM from goods; or
2. mints coins that are IPM;

and is approved by IRAS under the ARCS.

1. ### GST suspension on imports


As an Approved Refiner, you enjoy import GST suspension for the following scenarios:


1. Importation of your own goods in the course or furtherance of your business;
2. Importation of goods belonging to your overseas non GST-registered principal for supply (either in Singapore or for export), as a [section 33(2) agent](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/importing-of-goods#332 "section 33(2) agent") \*. The overseas principal must not be GST-registered or if he is GST-registered, the
       registration is as a pay-only person under the [Overseas Vendor Registration regime](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-and-digital-economy/local-businesses "Overseas Vendor Registration regime");
3. Importation of goods belonging to your overseas non GST-registered principal which will subsequently be re-exported, as a [section 33A agent](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/importing-of-goods#332 "section 33A agent") \*. The overseas principal must not be GST-registered or if he is GST-registered, the registration
       is as a pay-only person under the [Overseas Vendor Registration regime](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-and-digital-economy/local-businesses "Overseas Vendor Registration regime");
4. Importation of goods (for example, materials or precious metals) consigned to you by an non GST-registered overseas customer, for the purpose of refining them into IPM or precious metals. The overseas customer must not be registered for GST
       or if he is GST-registered, the registration is as a pay-only person under the [Overseas Vendor Registration regime](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-and-digital-economy/local-businesses "Overseas Vendor Registration regime"); and

5. Re-importation of goods which you previously sent abroad for value-added activities, belonging to your local customer or GST-registered overseas customer (other than a person registered under the Overseas Vendor Registration
       regime as a pay-only person) if the requirements under section 33B explained in [GST: Claiming of GST on re-import of value-added goods](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etax-guide_claiming-of-gst-on-re-import-of-value-added-goods_third-edition.pdf?sfvrsn=a52d4f62_14 "GST: Claiming of GST on re-import of value-added goods") (PDF,

2. ### Supply goods to other ARCS persons without collecting GST


You are not required to collect and account for GST when you supply goods to another ARCS person in the course or furtherance of your business.

This however does not include the supply of refining activities. You need to account for 9% GST on the supply of refining activities relating to goods delivered locally.

Where it relates to goods being exported, the refining activities may be zero-rated provided that the relevant export documentation is maintained.

3. ### Claim more input tax

You are able to claim all the input tax you incurred the course or furtherance of your business, except for [expenses specifically disallowed under Regulations 26 and 27](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/conditions-for-claiming-input-tax#disallowed-input-tax-claims "expenses specifically disallowed under Regulations 26 and 27").


## Benefits for Approved Consolidators

An Approved Consolidator consolidates or aggregates materials for supply or delivery to specified refiners to be refined into IPM and is approved by IRAS under the ARCS.

1. ### GST suspension on imports




You enjoy import GST suspension on goods (for example, materials or precious metals) which:

1. Belong to you or are consigned to you by an overseas person who is not registered for GST in Singapore or if he is registered, the registration is as a pay-only person under the Overseas Vendor Registration regime; and
2. Are to be **directly** supplied or delivered to a refiner for the purpose of refining them into investment precious metals or precious metals.
2. ### Supply goods to other ARCS persons without collecting GST




You are not required to collect or account for GST when you supply goods to an Approver Refiner in the course or furtherance of your business.

3. ### Claim more input tax




You can claim more input tax than you would be entitled to under normal GST rules:

1. **If you are not a bank**

      You are able to claim full input tax on expenses incurred for the purchase of goods for conversion into IPM and making the first sale of newly refined IPM.

      Your residual input tax will be subject to a special apportionment formula, as set out in the ARCS e-Tax guide.

2. **If you are a bank**

      You are able to claim full input tax only on the purchase and import of precious metals. Other expenses will be subject to your fixed input tax recovery rate.
