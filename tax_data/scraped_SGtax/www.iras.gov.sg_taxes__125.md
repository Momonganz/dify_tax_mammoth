## Filing trust income tax for the deceased

Income arising after the deceased's date of death is subject to trust income tax.

## Property tax rates for properties with deceased owners

The concessionary owner-occupier tax rates apply when the owner owns and lives in the residential property. Deceased owners are not eligible for [owner-occupier tax rates](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/property-tax/property-owners/property-tax-reliefs/lower-property-tax-rates-for-owner-occupied-residential-properties#title2 "owner-occupier tax rates"). The tax rates will be adjusted upon death and the properties will be taxed at higher residential tax rates.
