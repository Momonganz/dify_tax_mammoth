## Filing of GST F8

Filing of a GST F8 is like that of a GST F5 except that you need to account for GST on:

1. [business assets held on the last day of registration](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-registration-deregistration/cancelling-gst-registration#title6); and
2. [supplies where goods/services are delivered/performed before your date of cancellation but invoice and payment is only issued/received after your date of cancellation](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-registration-deregistration/cancelling-gst-registration#title7).

The value of assets and supplies of goods/services should be reported in Box 1 of the GST F8 and the corresponding value of GST to be accounted should be reported in Box 6 of the GST F8.

For more details, please refer to the IRAS webpage on [Cancelling GST registration](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-registration-deregistration/cancelling-gst-registration).

[**Box 1: Total value of standard-rated supplies**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/filing-gst/completing-gst-returns#box-1--total-value-of-standard-rated-supplies)

Box 1 refers to the value of the supplies which are subject to GST at the standard rate of 9%. The value you enter in this box should not include the GST amount charged.

The amount in this box is your total supplies made for the accounting period. It will be automatically computed after you have filled in the amounts for box 1, box 2 and box 3.

[**Box 5: Total value of taxable purchases**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/filing-gst/completing-gst-returns#box-5--total-value-of-taxable-purchases)

Box 5 refers to the value of your standard-rated purchases (including imports) for [which the GST incurred can be claimed](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/conditions-for-claiming-input-tax "which the GST incurred can be claimed"), and zero-rated purchases. The value to be entered in Box 5 should exclude any GST amount.

For example, if you buy or import goods for $100 with $9 of GST, you should include $100 in box 5 and $9 in box 7 (Input tax and refunds claimed).

You should track the value of each purchase for box 5 separately from its input tax to claim. In other words, the value in box 5 should not be computed by re-grossing the value of input tax to claim (box 7).

[**Box 6: Output tax due**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/filing-gst/completing-gst-returns#box-6--output-tax-due)

The amount to fill in box 6 is the GST you have charged on your standard-rated supplies.

For example, if you sell goods for $100 and charge $9 of GST, you should include $100 in box 1 (Total Value of Standard-Rated Supplies) and $9 in box 6.

Since differences may arise due to different rounding methods used during computation, do not calculate the value of the output tax due by using the value of standard-rated supplies in box 1. You should instead track the value for box 6 separately from
the value of standard-rated supplies.

[**Box 7: Input tax and refunds claimed**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/filing-gst/completing-gst-returns#box-7--input-tax-and-refunds-claimed)

The amount you fill in box 7 includes:

- GST incurred for your purchases, subject to the [conditions for claiming input tax](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/conditions-for-claiming-input-tax "conditions for claiming input tax").
For example, if you buy or import goods for $100 with $9 of GST, you should include $100 in box 5 (Total Value of Taxable Purchases) and $9 in box 7.
- Other GST refunds to claim (e.g. bad debt relief) in box 7.

Please do not calculate the value of the input tax by using the value of taxable purchases in box 5. You should instead track the value for box 7 separately from the value of taxable purchases.

Please exclude non-operating income such as:

- Income from sale/disposal of fixed assets

## FAQs

[**If I have submitted an incorrect value of my revenue as well as other value(s) in the GST return, what should I do?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/filing-gst/completing-gst-returns#if-i-have-submitted-an-incorrect-value-of-my-revenue-as-well-as-other-value-s--in-the-gst-return--what-should-i-do-)

If you have made a mistake in your past GST return(s), you can correct the error(s) in your current GST F5 return if:

(a) The **net GST amount payable** **in error** for **all** the affected prescribed accounting periods is **not more than $3,000**.  Net GST amount payable in error refers to the difference between the additional output tax to be paid in Box 6 and the additional input tax to be claimed in Box 7;

(b) The **total amount in error** for all other boxes except Box 6, 7 and 12 (pre-registration input tax claims) for **each** of the affected accounting period(s) is **not more than 5%** of the total value of supplies (Box 4) declared in the submitted GST return. In the case where there was no supply made in the affected accounting period, the 5% rule applies to the total value of the taxable purchases (Box 5).

In such circumstance, if you have reported an estimated value of your revenue in Box 13 of an earlier GST F5 return, you are not required to adjust the revenue figure in the current GST F5 return. Please ensure that you report the correct value of your revenue for the subsequent GST returns.

If you failed to satisfy any of the above conditions, please correct the errors, including the value of the revenue by submitting a GST F7 return (“Disclosure of Errors on GST Return”) for the affected prescribed accounting periods.
