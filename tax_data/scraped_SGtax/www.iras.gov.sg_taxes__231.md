We encourage you to file early. Penalties and enforcement actions may be taken for late or non-filing of your company’s Corporate Income Tax Return.

For Form C-S filers, you may also adopt #SeamlessFilingFromSoftware (#SFFS) to automate the preparation and filing of Form C-S to IRAS via accounting software. The entire filing process including Corppass authentication is linked to IRAS’ systems
via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which acts as intermediaries that allow 2 applications to talk to each other. This simplifies the tax filing process for companies and reduces their risk of making errors. Learn more about [#SFFS](https://www.iras.gov.sg/digital-collaboration/for-businesses-employers "#SFFS").
