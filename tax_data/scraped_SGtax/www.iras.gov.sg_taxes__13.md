## How will the GST rate change affect you as a consumer?

### 1) Rate of GST chargeable on your purchases

As a general rule, purchases of goods and services from [GST-registered businesses](http://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx?target=GSTListingSearch) made in 2023 will be subject to GST at 8%, and purchases
on or after 1 Jan 2024 will be subject to GST at 9%.

There are scenarios where one or more of the following events straddle 1 Jan 2024:

- Issuance of invoice
- Payment for the goods or services
- Receipt of goods or services

In these scenarios, special GST rules will apply. Here are some common scenarios.

Scenario 1

- Full payment for goods or services made in 2023
- Goods or services received on or after 1 Jan 2024

If full payment is received by the supplier for the goods or services in 2023, GST will be chargeable at 8% regardless of when the invoice is issued or when the goods or services are provided to you.

[**Example 1**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-rate-change/gst-rate-change-for-consumers1#example-1)

On 14 Dec 2023, you purchase goods to be delivered on 10 Jan 2024. You receive a tax invoice on 14 Dec 2023 and full payment is received by the supplier on the same day.

GST will be chargeable at 8% since full payment is received by the supplier for the goods before 1 Jan 2024.

Scenario 1A

- Part payment for goods or services made in 2023
- Goods or services received on or after 1 Jan 2024

If part payment is received by the supplier for the goods or services in 2023, GST will be chargeable at 8% on the payment amount regardless of when the invoice is issued or when the goods or services are provided to you. For the remaining payment, GST
will be chargeable at 9%.

[**Example 1A**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-rate-change/gst-rate-change-for-consumers1#example-1a)

On 14 Dec 2023, you purchase $500 worth of goods to be delivered on 10 Jan 2024. You receive a tax invoice on 14 Dec 2023 and part payment of $200 is received by the supplier on the same day. The remaining payment of $300 will be received by the supplier in 2024.

GST will be chargeable at 8% on the part payment of $200 received by the supplier in 2023 and at 9% on the remaining payment of $300 received by the supplier in 2024.

Scenario 2

- Invoice issued in 2023
- Goods or services received in 2023
- Payment for goods or services made on or after 1 Jan 2024

If you receive both the invoice and the goods or services in 2023, GST will be chargeable at 8% regardless of when the payment for the goods or services is made.

[**Example 2**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-rate-change/gst-rate-change-for-consumers1#example-2)

You receive a tax invoice on 21 Dec 2023 for cleaning services provided to you on 20 Dec 2023. Payment is received by the cleaning service provider on 14 Jan 2024 when the prevailing GST rate is 9%.

GST will be chargeable at 8% since you received both the invoice and the services in 2023.

Scenario 2A

- Invoice issued in 2023
- Partial goods or services received in 2023
- Payment for goods or services made on or after 1 Jan 2024

If you receive the invoice and partial goods or services in 2023, GST will be chargeable at 8% on the value of goods or services received in 2023.  For the remaining value of goods or services received on/after 1 Jan 2024, GST will be chargeable at 9%.

The supplier will issue a credit note to adjust the GST charged at 8% on the value of the goods or services received on/after 1 Jan 2024.  A new tax invoice will be issued to charge GST at 9% on the value of the goods or services received on/after 1 Jan 2024.

[**Example 2A**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-rate-change/gst-rate-change-for-consumers1#example-2a)

You receive a tax invoice on 10 Dec 2023 with 8% GST charged for the cleaning services that will be provided on 20 Dec 2023 and 20 Jan 2024. Payment is received by the cleaning service provider on 20 Jan 2024.

GST is chargeable at 8% on the cleaning services received in 2023 and 9% on the cleaning services received on/after 1 Jan 2024.  The supplier will issue you a credit note to adjust the GST charged at 8% on the value of cleaning services received on 20 Jan 2024.  A new tax invoice will be issued to you to charge GST at 9% on the value of cleaning service received on 20 Jan 2024.

Scenario 3

- Invoice issued in 2023
- Full payment for goods or services made on or after 1 Jan 2024
- Goods or services received on or after 1 Jan 2024

If you make full payment and receive the goods or services on or after 1 Jan 2024, GST will be chargeable at 9% even if the invoice is issued in 2023. In this case, as the original invoice will reflect GST at 8%, the supplier will issue a credit note to cancel the original tax invoice and issue a new tax invoice that reflects GST at 9%.

[**Example 3**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-rate-change/gst-rate-change-for-consumers1#example-3)

On 20 Dec 2023, you purchase goods and receive a tax invoice when the prevailing GST rate is 8%. The supplier receives the payment on 3 Jan 2024 and the goods are delivered on 15 Jan 2024.

GST will be chargeable at 9% since the goods are delivered to you and full payment is received by the supplier after 1 Jan 2024. The supplier will issue you a credit note to cancel the original tax invoice, and a new tax invoice will be issued to you to charge GST at 9%.

To check whether a business is registered for GST, please use our [GST Registered Business Search digital service](http://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx?target=GSTListingSearch).

### 2) Price display by GST-registered businesses

[GST-registered businesses](http://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx?target=GSTListingSearch) must display GST-inclusive prices on their price displays to the public. In other words, what you see must be the final
price you pay.

From 1 Jan 2024, the prices displayed by GST-registered businesses must be inclusive of GST at 9%. Businesses that are unable to switch their price display overnight may display 2 prices:

(a) One applicable before 1 Jan 2024 showing prices inclusive of GST at 8%

(b) One applicable on or after 1 Jan 2024 showing prices inclusive of GST at 9%

However, they cannot charge and collect GST at 9% before 1 Jan 2024.

An exception is granted to hotels and food & beverage (F&B) establishments that impose service charge on their goods and services. They are not required to display GST-inclusive prices for goods and services that are subject to service charge
to ease their operations. However, they must still display a prominent statement informing customers that the prices displayed are subject to GST and service charge.

The exception does not apply to hotels and F&B establishments that do not impose a service charge. It is also not applicable to F&B establishments that levy a nominal service charge without genuine business reasons other than to avoid displaying
GST-inclusive prices. Such businesses are still required to display GST-inclusive prices. Those who do not comply with the price display requirement could be subject to a fine.

### 3) Reporting wrong GST practices of businesses

Wrong GST practices of businesses include:

- Charging and collecting GST at 9% before 1 Jan 2024
- Charging and collecting GST when they are not registered for GST
- Non-compliance with [price display requirements](http://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/basics-of-gst/invoicing-price-display-and-record-keeping/displaying-and-quoting-prices)
- Non-compliance with [invoicing requirements](http://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/basics-of-gst/invoicing-price-display-and-record-keeping/invoicing-customers)

To report wrong GST practices of businesses, please write to us by submitting [this form](https://form.gov.sg/#!/633ea88671c61100125dae3e).

### 4) Reporting unjustified price increases using GST as cover

The Committee Against Profiteering (CAP) was reconvened on 16 Mar 2022, to investigate feedback on unjustified price increases of essential products and services that use the GST increase as a cover.

If a business raises its prices, it is not
acceptable for the business to use the GST increase as the reason for raising prices before the GST rate change, nor is it acceptable for a business to raise prices by more than the GST increase after the GST rate change, citing the GST increase as
the reason.

If you come across cases of unjustified price increases of essential goods or services that use the GST increase as a cover, please [provide your feedback to the CAP](https://www.cap.gov.sg/shareyourfeedback).
All feedback submitted will be reviewed by the CAP, and further investigated if necessary, to identify businesses that may have engaged in unjustified price increases on the pretext of the GST increase.

For more information, please visit
the
[Committee Against Profiteering’s website](https://www.cap.gov.sg/).

### 5) Support for households

At Budget 2022, the Minister for Finance announced the **Assurance Package for GST** to cushion the impact of the planned GST increase, and **enhancements to the permanent GST Voucher scheme** to provide continuing help to defray
the GST expenses of lower- to middle-income Singaporean households, beyond the transitional support covered by the Assurance Package.

For more information, please visit [MOF’s FAQs on the Assurance Package for GST](https://www.mof.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider3/budget2022/download/pdf/faqs_assurance-package-for-gst.pdf) and [MOF’s FAQs on the Enhanced Permanent GST Voucher Scheme](https://www.mof.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider3/budget2022/download/pdf/faqs_enhanced-permanent-gstv.pdf).

1. Yes, GST will be chargeable at 8% if you make payment for the invoice before 1 Jan 2024. However, if payment is made on or after 1 Jan 2024, 9% GST will be applicable for the services for the period from Jan to Feb 2024.
2. For GST purposes, a payment is considered received by the supplier only if it is received in respect of a specific supply and accepted or agreed as such by the customer and supplier. Voluntary payments that are made by you in excess of what is required by the supplier is not regarded as payments received by the supplier. Generally, a supplier would treat the excess payment as a credit balance in your account to be used to offset future supply of services, the value of which will be determined at the point when the invoice is issued.  In this case, for the maintenance services from Mar 2024 to Nov 2024, GST will be chargeable at 9% for the supply of services invoiced in 2024.

GST will be reflected at 8% on the tax invoice issued to you on 15 Dec 2023. As payment is received by the cleaning service company after 1 Jan 2024, the company will adjust the GST chargeable to 9% for the part of the services performed on or after 1 Jan 2024.

As the value of services performed on or after 1 Jan 2024 is $800, the supplier will issue:

- a credit note for $864 ($800 plus 8% GST of $64); and
- a new tax invoice for $872 ($800 plus 9% GST of $72).

GST remains chargeable at 8% on the value of services performed before 1 Jan 2024 (i.e. $200).

If you decide to make the full payment of $1,000 and the cleaning service company receives the payment before 1 Jan 2024, GST is chargeable at 8% on the entire service.

GST will be chargeable at 8% on the tax invoice issued to you on 1 Nov 2023. However, as a part of the payment is received by the contractor and a part of the services is performed on or after 1 Jan 2024, the contractor will need to adjust the GST chargeable
from 8% to 9% on the lower of:

- the part payment received on or after 1 Jan 2024; or
- the value of the renovation services performed on or after 1 Jan 2024.

The value of the renovation services performed on or after 1 Jan 2024 is $80,000 and the payment received by the contractor on or after 1 Jan 2024 is $60,000.  The lower of the 2 values which is $60,000 will be subject to 9% GST.  The payment of $40,000 (deposit of $10,000 and progressive payment of $30,000) received by the contractor in 2023 will continue to be subject to 8% GST.

The contractor will issue:

- a credit note for $64,800 ($60,000 plus 8% GST of $4,800); and
- a new tax invoice for $65,400 ($60,000 plus 9% GST of $5,400).

If the value of the imported goods including insurance and freight (CIF value) by air or post is $400 or less, no import GST is collected by Singapore Customs as there is import relief for such goods.  However, from 1 Jan 2023 onwards, non-GST registered persons, including end consumers will need to pay GST if they purchase goods valued at $400 and below, which are imported via air or post, from a GST-registered vendor registered under the OVR regime.

If the value of the goods including insurance and freight (CIF value) by air or post exceeds $400, import GST of 9% is payable since the goods are imported on/after 1 Jan 2024. If your freight forwarder had collected import GST in advance from you at 8%, they may collect an additional 1% GST from you.

GST-registered suppliers should only charge 9% GST on the sale of Low-Value Goods to consumers in Singapore from 1 Jan 2024 SG time.  As the sale of headset is before 1 Jan 2024 SG time, it will be subject to 8% GST.
