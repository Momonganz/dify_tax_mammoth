## Regulated Financial Institutions

The Monetary Authority of Singapore regulates the activities of the financial institutions. Examples of financial institutions include banks, insurance companies and stock brokers.

## Exempt Financial Services

When the financial services provided fall within the 4th Schedule of the [GST Act](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/GSTA1993),
the services are [exempt supplies](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/charging-gst-(output-tax)/when-is-gst-not-charged/supplies-exempt-from-gst "exempt supplies"). No GST needs to be charged for exempt supplies.

Examples of these financial services that are exempt supplies include:

- Provision of loans;
- Issue / sales of shares or bonds;
- Provision of life policy by an insurance company;
- Charges by banks for the operation of bank accounts;
- Exchange of currency; and
- Provision of derivative that does not lead to any delivery of goods or services.

For the full list of exempt financial services, please refer to the [list of financial services](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/list-of-financial-services.pdf?sfvrsn=4dcb1161_2 "list of financial services") (PDF, 170KB).

### Arranging of Exempt Financial Services

Services such as the arranging or broking of insurance, underwriting or advising of financial activities do not fall within the scope of exemption. You need to **charge GST** for such services.

Where the services qualify as [international services](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/charging-gst-(output-tax)/when-to-charge-0-gst-(zero-rate)/providing-international-services "international services"), you may **zero-rate** such supply of services (i.e. charge GST at 0%).

## Claiming GST Incurred

When you make exempt supplies and taxable supplies, GST incurred on your business purchases cannot be claimed in full unless you satisfy the [De Minimis Rule](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/claiming-input-tax-incurred-to-make-exempt-supplies "De Minimis Rule").

### Rules for Claiming GST Incurred

You must follow the rules below when claiming GST incurred on your business purchases:

1. You are allowed to claim input tax that is directly attributable to the making of taxable supplies, subject to [conditions for claiming input tax](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/conditions-for-claiming-input-tax "conditions for claiming input tax").
2. You cannot claim input tax that is directly attributable to the making of exempt supplies.
3. For input tax that cannot be identified as directly attributable to either taxable or exempt supplies (i.e. residual input tax), the amount that can be claimed is computed using the following apportionment formula:



Total Allowable
       Residual Input    Value of Taxable Supplies1

Residual Input     =       Tax
        x       Value of Total Supplies1

           Tax


1The value of relevant supplies received from your supplier that are subject to customer accounting, imported services and low-value goods that are subject to [reverse charge](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-and-digital-economy/local-businesses "reverse charge") and supplies of remote services and low-value goods made on behalf of underlying suppliers through your marketplace under the [Overseas Vendor Registration regime](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-and-digital-economy/local-businesses "Overseas Vendor Registration Regime") should be reported as your taxable supplies. However, the value of such supplies should be
excluded from the numerator and denominator of the apportionment formula.

For more information, please refer to [GST: Partial Exemption and Input Tax Recovery](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etax-guide-on-partial-exemption-and-input-tax-recovery-6th-edition.pdf?sfvrsn=cbbae7c6_14 "GST: Guide Partial Exemption and Input Tax Recovery (Sixth Edition)") (PDF, 459KB).

Download the [Partial Exemption Input Tax Recovery Calculator](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/xls/gst_partial-exemption-input-tax-recovery-calculator.xls?sfvrsn=b13d2c04_8 "Partial Exemption Input Tax Recovery Calculator") (XLS, 955KB) and use it to compute your input tax claimable.

### Banking Industry

For ease of compliance, banks are approved to adopt a fixed input tax recovery rate for the purposes of claiming input tax (excluding disallowed expenses) on an industry basis. This ratio is reviewed on a yearly basis.

From 1 Apr 2025, banks may opt to apply the special input tax recovery method which allows input tax attribution and apportionment (the “Special Method”), instead of the fixed input tax recovery rate. Banks that opt for the Special Method are required to submit an application and obtain approval from IRAS before applying the Special Method. Banks that do not wish to opt for the Special Method will continue to use the fixed input tax recovery rate for their input tax claims, by default.

Banks that obtained their banking license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) on or after 1 Apr 2025 must seek IRAS’ approval on the input tax recovery method they wish to adopt i.e., either the fixed input tax recovery rate or the Special Method. For digital banks that are granted a digital full bank license or digital wholesale bank license by the MAS, the use of the fixed input tax recovery rate will be allowed on a case-by-case basis.

For more information, please refer to “ [GST: Special input tax recovery method for banks](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide_special-input-tax-recovery-method-for-banks_first-edition_v1-0.pdf?sfvrsn=12040a98_4)”.

## Claiming GST on Expenses for Qualifying Funds

Funds (including Variable Capital Companies (“VCCs”)) may incur GST when the fund procures services (e.g. fund management service) from GST-registered businesses. A GST remission is granted until 31 Dec 2029 to allow funds that meet qualifying
conditions to claim the GST incurred.

To simplify the rules for claiming GST incurred, funds that meet all the qualifying conditions are allowed to claim GST incurred on expenses incurred for the purpose of the fund's qualifying investment activities, with the exception of disallowed expenses under the regulations 26 and 27 of the GST (General) Regulations, at
an annual fixed recovery rate.

**Extension of GST remission to Section 13H\* Funds**

In Budget 2020, the Government announced that GST remission will be extended to approved venture capital funds under section 13H of the Income Tax Act (section 13H funds)
from 1 Apr 2020 to 31 Dec 2025. Under the GST remission, section 13H funds that meet the qualifying conditions will be able to claim the GST incurred on their expenses at a fixed recovery rate to be determined for the industry.

_\\* Note: Section 13H had been renumbered to Section 13G with effect from 31 Dec 2021._

**Qualifying conditions**

To qualify for the GST remission, the funds must:

1. be managed by a prescribed fund manager in Singapore; and
2. satisfy the conditions for specific income tax concessions as at the last day of their preceding financial year\*.

\*The commencement date of the GST remission for the fund is the effective date of the GST remission or the date that the fund is granted approval for the specific income tax concession, whichever is later. The end date of the GST remission for the fund
is the last day that the fund qualifies for the specific income tax concession.

**Example in determining the eligibility of GST remission in the financial year 2018:**

| Fund’s financial year end | Eligible for income tax concession | Eligible for GST remission for 1 year from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Fund’s financial year end** 31 Mar | **Eligible for income tax concession** As at 31 Mar 2018 | **Eligible for income tax concession** YA2019 | **Eligible for income tax concession** Yes | **Eligible for GST remission for 1 year from** 1 Apr 2018 to 31 Mar 2019 |
| **Fund’s financial year end** 30 Jun | **Eligible for income tax concession** As at 30 Jun 2018 | **Eligible for income tax concession** YA2019 | **Eligible for income tax concession** Yes | **Eligible for GST remission for 1 year from** 1 Jul 2018 to 30 Jun 2019 |
| **Fund’s financial year end** 30 Sep | **Eligible for income tax concession** As at 30 Sep 2018 | **Eligible for income tax concession** YA2019 | **Eligible for income tax concession** Yes | **Eligible for GST remission for 1 year from** 1 Oct 2018 to 30 Sep 2019 |
| **Fund’s financial year end** 31 Dec | **Eligible for income tax concession** As at 31 Dec 2018 | **Eligible for income tax concession** YA2019 | **Eligible for income tax concession** Yes | **Eligible for GST remission for 1 year from** 1 Jan 2019 to 31 Dec 2019 |

To claim the GST incurred, qualifying funds (including standalone VCCs and sub-funds of umbrella VCCs) will each have to file a quarterly Statement of Claims to IRAS based on its financial year end. Each Statement of Claims is due one month after the
end of the respective quarters. As an administrative concession, funds may file their quarterly Statement of Claims after the due date, subject to the following conditions:

1. The GST claims are made on tax invoices dated within the relevant quarter; and
2. The quarterly Statements of Claims are filed within 5 years from the end of the relevant quarter.

Example:

Period of claims: 1 Oct 2020 to 31 Dec 2020

Qualifying funds can file the Statement of Claims latest by 31 Dec 2025, and claim GST on tax invoices dated from 1 Oct 2020 to 31 Dec 2020.

For more information on documents to support GST claims by qualifying funds, please refer to [Explanatory Notes to GST Remission For Qualifying Funds](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/explanatory-notes-to-gst-remission-for-prescribed-funds.pdf?sfvrsn=a47ac1c9_7) (PDF, 157KB).

**Administrative Concession**

Funds (e.g., newly set-up funds) can claim the GST incurred in their first year of the grant of income tax concession if they meet the conditions of the specific income tax concession at the end of the first year.

[**Example: Fund meets the conditions of income tax concession at the end of first year**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/specific-business-sectors/finance#example--fund-meets-the-conditions-of-income-tax-concession-at-the-end-of-first-year)

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Fund’s financial year end** | 31 Dec |
| **Date of fund granted approval for the specific income tax concession** | 1 Jul 2022 |
| **Eligibility for income tax concession** | As at 31 Dec 2022<br>(First year) | YA2023 | Eligible as all conditions for income tax concession met |
| **Eligible for GST remission** | 1 Jan 2023 to 31 Dec 2023 as the fund meets the conditions for the income tax concession at the last day of their preceding financial year (31 Dec 2022).<br>As a concession, the GST incurred from 1 Jul 2022 to 31 Dec 2022 can be claimed, but only after the fund established that it meets the conditions for the income tax concession as at 31 Dec 2022. |

**\[NEW!\] Enhanced administrative concession**

If a fund cannot meet the conditions of the specific income tax concession at the end of the first year of the grant of income tax concession as it is unable to meet the minimum spending requirement, but the fund is able to meet the conditions at the end of the second year, the fund can claim the GST incurred in the second year. However, the GST can only be claimed after the fund has established that it meets the conditions of the income tax concession at the end of the second year. The GST incurred in the first year remains not claimable.

[**Example: Fund meets the conditions of income tax concession at the end of second year**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/specific-business-sectors/finance#example--fund-meets-the-conditions-of-income-tax-concession-at-the-end-of-second-year)

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Fund’s financial year end** | 31 Dec |
| **Date of fund granted approval for the specific income tax concession** | 1 Nov 2022 |
| **Eligibility for income tax concession** | As at 31 Dec 2022<br>(First year) | YA2023 | Not eligible as minimum spending requirement not met |
| As at 31 Dec 2023<br>(Second year) | YA2024 | Eligible as all conditions for income tax concession met |
| **Eligible for GST remission** | 1 Jan 2024 to 31 Dec 2024 as the fund meets the conditions for the income tax concession at the last day of their preceding financial year (31 Dec 2023).<br>As a concession, the GST incurred from 1 Jan 2023 to 31 Dec 2023 can be claimed, but only after the fund established that it meets the conditions for the income tax concession as at 31 Dec 2023.<br>The GST incurred from 1 Nov 2022 to 31 Dec 2022 remains not claimable. |

You need **not** seek prior approval from IRAS to apply the enhanced concession. Funds that qualify for the enhanced concession can claim the GST in their next Statement of Claim and maintain the relevant documents to support the GST claims.

**E-Filing of Statement of Claims**

To improve the filing experience for funds, a new e-Service is now available for qualifying funds to e-File their Statement of Claims. With effect from **1 Jul 2020**, it will be compulsory
for funds to e-File their Statement of Claims using the e-Service. Submission of Statement of Claims via myTax Mail will no longer be accepted.

Funds are strongly encouraged to start e-Filing their Statement of Claims early to enjoy the following benefits:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| (1) Easier filing process | - Fewer fields to complete<br>- Funds are not required to submit documents unless requested by IRAS |
| (2) Faster processing time | - Receive your refund within 30 days unless your Statement of Claims is selected for audit. |
| (3) Instant acknowledgement | - Receive acknowledgement when Statement of claims are e-Filed successfully. |

To submit the Statement of Claims electronically, the qualifying fund must complete the necessary Corppass configuration.

1. A senior official (e.g. CEO, Chairman, Honorary Treasurer, Vice President) must appoint a Corppass Administrator using the " [Appointment or Removal of Corppass Admin Form SG](https://form.gov.sg/5b90a2cb407059000fa734f2)". Corppass will notify the Corppass Administrator when the appointment takes effect.
2. Once appointed, the Corppass Administrator must select the appropriate digital services for the qualifying fund's transactions. Please select:

a. "GST (FILING AND APPLICATIONS)"; and

b. "FOR NON-UEN ENTITY ONLY" (When prompted, enter the ASGD number issued by IRAS as additional details for this digital service)

5. The Corppass Administrator must authorise an individual to e-File, which may include a third party such as a tax agent firm. The person who is filing must be assigned:

a. "GST (FILING AND APPLICATION)" digital service with "Approver" role; and

b. "FOR NON-UEN ENTITY ONLY" digital service.

This setup ensures that the qualifying fund can access the necessary e-Filing services for submitting the Statement of Claims and that the appropriate individual is authorised to perform the e-Filing.

**Qualifying Funds submitting the first Statement of Claims**

Qualifying funds that are applying for GST remission for the first time need to perform an additional step. These funds will have to submit an online [Application for GST Remission for Qualifying Funds](https://form.gov.sg/5ed5bcb0f2ec2d00118f4844 "Application for GST Remission for Qualifying Funds")(Singpass authentication\* required) and attach the
following documents:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Funds under S13O (formerly S13R) and S13U (formerly S13X)^ | - Approval letter from MAS; and<br>- All Annual Declarations submitted to MAS from the date of approval from MAS |
| Funds under S13G (formerly S13H)^ | - Letter of Offer from Enterprise Singapore;<br>- Fund's acceptance of offer;<br>- Annual report submitted to Enterprise Singapore; and<br>- Letter of undertaking by fund |
| Funds under S13D (formerly S13CA)^ | - Certificate of incorporation and the appointment of letter of local fund manager (for overseas fund); or<br>- Relevant documents to support the date of commencement of GST remission; and<br>- Letter of undertaking by fund |
| Designated Unit Trust | - Relevant documents to support the date of commencement of GST remission; and<br>- Annual Declaration Form |
| Other funds that are approved under the GST remission | - Relevant documents to support the date of commencement of GST remission; and<br>- Letter of undertaking by fund |

_^Note: The renumbering changes took effect from 31 Dec 2021._

Additional documents may be requested by IRAS. After the application is approved, the qualifying fund will receive a notification from IRAS. It can then set up its Corppass authorisation and start e-Filing its Statement of Claims at myTax Portal.

\\* Funds will have to submit their application using the Singpass account of the funds or their trustee, fund manager or tax agent. For non-incorporated funds, they will also have to submit the trust deed with the application.

You are encouraged to apply for GIRO for a faster and more convenient way to receive your tax refund. Please mail the completed original copy of the [GIRO application form](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/forms/other-taxes-and-services/giro-application-forms "GIRO application form") to 55 Newton Road Singapore 307987 after submitting your application online.

## GST Registration by Way of Reverse Charge

From 1 Jan 2020, GST will be levied on Business-to-Business imported services by way of [reverse charge](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-and-digital-economy/local-businesses "reverse charge"). If the total value of your imported services for a 12-month period exceeds $1 million, funds (including qualifying funds) may become liable for GST-registration. Once registered, funds (including qualifying
funds) will be required to report and account for GST on their imported services in the GST returns.

From 1 Jan 2023, the application of reverse charge would be extended to the purchase of imported low-value goods (“LVG”). The requirement to perform reverse charge applies to all low-value goods and includes low-value goods purchased from local and overseas suppliers, electronic marketplaces and redeliverers, regardless of whether they are GST-registered or not. From 1 Jan 2023, if the total value of your imported services and low-value goods for a 12-month period exceeds S$1 million, and you would not be entitled to full input tax credit even if you were GST-registered, you may become liable for GST-registration under the new GST registration rules. Once registered for GST, you will be required to account for GST on your taxable supplies, your imported services and low-value goods which are subject to reverse charge.

GST-registered funds may include the GST claims under remission that are not claimed in the Statement of Claims previously, in the GST return. The recovery rate to be applied on the GST claims will be the prevailing rate based on the date of the
invoices.

For more information on GST registration and the reporting requirements under the reverse charge regime, please refer to [GST: Reverse Charge](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/gst-taxing-imported-services-by-way-of-reverse-charge-(2nd-edition).pdf?sfvrsn=64fc1f4a_36) (PDF, 947KB).

## Reporting Exempt Supplies

Exempt supplies have to be reported in **Box 3** (Total value of exempt supplies) of your GST return.

You may engage in foreign currency transactions and derivative transactions such as swaps, futures and forwards which do not lead to the physical delivery of goods or services.

You should report the **net realised gains or losses** arising from such transactions as the value of exempt supplies.

Exempt supplies arising from the issuance or sale of shares, bonds, options, warrants, interest rate collars, floors and caps are reported based on **gross proceeds received**.

Find out more on value of exempt supplies to be reported in [How Do I Prepare My GST Return](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide_gst_how-do-i-prepare-my-gst-return.pdf?sfvrsn=535a7393_72 "How Do I Prepare My GST Return") (PDF, 790KB).

You can claim the GST incurred on the expenses in full provided that:

1. The tax invoices are dated on or after 1 Mar 2022;
2. You make payment only after the tax invoices are issued by the supplier; and
3. The underlying services are not performed before 22 Jan 2009.
