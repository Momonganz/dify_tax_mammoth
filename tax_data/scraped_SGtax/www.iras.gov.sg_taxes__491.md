The majority of property owners pay their property taxes on time. The payment due date for the annual property tax bill is 31 Jan each year or by the due date stated in the bill. You will incur penalties and face recovery actions for late or non-payment of taxes.

On this page:

## Consequences for late payment or non-payment of taxes

IRAS may take the following actions if you fail to pay by the due date:

1. Impose a late payment penalty
2. Appoint agents like your bank, employer, tenant or lawyer (handling the sale of any of your property) to recover the overdue tax
3. Initiate the sale of the said property through a public auction to settle the overdue tax

The above list is not exhaustive.

## Late payment penalty

Unless you are on an approved instalment plan, a 5% late payment penalty will be imposed on the unpaid tax if full payment is not received by the due date.

[**Example 1: Penalty imposed for late payment**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/property-tax/property-owners/payments/late-payment-or-non-payment-of-property-tax#example-1--penalty-imposed-for-late-payment)

Date of the Property Tax bill is 16 Dec 2024 (for year 2025 Property Tax) and the tax payable is $1,000.

5% late payment penalty of $50 (i.e. 5% x $1,000) was imposed as the tax was still not paid by 31 Jan 2025.

| Date of Property Tax Bill | Property Tax Due Date | Tax Payable | 5% Late Payment Penalty Imposed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Date of Property Tax Bill** 16 Dec 2024 | **Property Tax Due Date** 31 Jan 2025 | **Tax Payable** $1,000 | **5% Late Payment Penalty Imposed** $50 |

If you have filed an objection and are awaiting the outcome, you still must pay the tax assessed as shown on the bill. Excess payment will be refunded to you if the bill is revised.

[**Example 2: Penalties and refunds when an objection is filed**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/property-tax/property-owners/payments/late-payment-or-non-payment-of-property-tax#example-2--penalties-and-refunds-when-an-objection-is-filed)

Property owner received the tax bill, with a tax payable of $1,300, dated 16 Dec 2024. The due date for payment is 31 Jan 2025.

Property owner filed an objection and did not pay the tax. As no payment was received by the due date, a 5% late payment penalty of $65 was imposed.

Property owner paid the tax and penalty on 1 Mar 2025. On 10 Mar 2025, the bill was amended to $200 and the late payment penalty was revised to $10 (5% late payment penalty on $200) accordingly. A refund of $1,155 was made to the property owner.

| Date of Bill | Due Date on Bill | Tax Amount | 5% Late Payment Penalty Imposed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Date of Bill** 16 Dec 2024 | **Due Date on Bill** 31 Jan 2025 | **Tax Amount** $1,300 | **5% Late Payment Penalty Imposed** $65 |
| **Date of Bill** 10 Mar 2025 | **Due Date on Bill** 31 Jan 2025 | **Tax Amount**($1,100) | **5% Late Payment Penalty Imposed** ($55) |
| **Date of Bill** Revised Tax and 5% Penalty | **Due Date on Bill** | **Tax Amount** $200 | **5% Late Payment Penalty Imposed** $10 |

## Appointment of agents

If the tax remains unpaid, IRAS may appoint agents such as your bank, employer, tenant, lawyer or other 3rd parties with money due to you to recover the outstanding taxes.

When your bank is appointed as an agent, you will experience inconvenience in using your bank accounts (e.g. being unable to access your bank accounts) until you have fully paid your Property Tax.

Requests for the release of your banks from the agent appointment made after 12pm on weekdays will only be processed on the next working day. Please note that requests cannot be processed on Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays.

Agents will be released from the appointment only after the tax and penalties have been paid in full. For outstanding property tax, IRAS may appoint agents of any of the property owners. Any excess payment will be refunded to the main applicant listed in the purchase of the HDB flat / first named owner in the Notice of Transfer.

## Checking tax balance and making payment

To check your current balance, log in to [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx) and select "View Account Summary”. You can make Property
Tax payments through various [payment modes](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/property-tax/property-owners/payments/how-to-pay "payment modes"). The payment will be processed within 3 working days.

If you are unable to pay the tax in full, you may apply for up to 12 interest-free monthly instalments via [GIRO](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/payments/giro-property-tax "GIRO").

The 12-month GIRO instalment cycle normally starts in Jan and ends in Dec. However, if you join GIRO after Jan, the instalment deduction will commence in the month after your GIRO application is approved and end in Dec.

### Difficulty paying your tax

If you [face difficulties with your tax payment](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/property-tax/property-owners/payments/experiencing-difficulties-in-paying-your-tax),
you may apply for a longer payment plan via the [Apply/Manage GIRO Plan](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/portal/giro/apply/select-bank) digital service at
[mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx).

If your payment plan is approved, you must follow the payment plan schedule. Otherwise, the plan will be cancelled and actions will be taken to recover the tax.

### GIRO cancellation or termination

You are advised to maintain sufficient funds in your bank account. If your GIRO deduction fails due to insufficient funds or incorrect limits set, etc., IRAS will cancel your GIRO plan. The balance of the unpaid taxes will become due and payable immediately. You may incur a penalty if you do not settle the unpaid taxes promptly.

If you repeatedly default on your payment plan, IRAS may reject your subsequent requests for payment arrangements.

For properties owned by more than 1 owner, all owners are collectively responsible for paying property tax.

The payment arrangement on the property tax payable is a private matter among the property owners. In the event of outstanding tax, recovery actions can be taken against any owner of the property to recover the tax.
