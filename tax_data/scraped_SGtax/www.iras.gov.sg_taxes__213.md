## Answers

**1) Why can't I see the "Employers" tab when I login to myTax Portal?**

This is because you have either:

- logged in to your personal income tax matter at [myTax Portal](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx "myTax Portal") login page using only your Singpass
**or**
- you have not been authorised to use the Submission of Employment Income Records digital service. Please refer to the [user guide to complete authorisation](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/corppass-authorisation-user-guide_employment-income.pdf?sfvrsn=61dfe5b5_20 "Authorisation Guide (pdf)") (PDF, 774KB) for details.

**2** **) The printout for the IR8A form did not fit into one page and/ or there are some texts appearing in the header/ footer of my printouts. What can I do?**

Customised browser settings may cause some users to encounter issues with printing IR8A forms and appendices when using Submit Employment Income Records at myTax Portal (online application). Please refer to our [Guide to Fit an IR8A Form or Appendix Printout into One Page](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/guide-to-fit-an-ir8a-form-or-appendix-printout-into-one-page.pdf?sfvrsn=74294ee6_2 "Guide to Fit an IR8A Form or Appendix Printout into One Page") (PDF, 1.31MB).
