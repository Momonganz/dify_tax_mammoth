Once a property is transferred to you, you will be liable for any outstanding property tax including arrears that should have been paid by the previous owner. If there is an outstanding tax amount, your lawyer will assist you to settle the outstanding
amount with the seller. Your lawyer will also apportion the current year tax between the seller and yourself. IRAS does not apportion property tax liabilities between the parties. The seller's lawyer will file a Notice of Transfer to IRAS within one
month of the sale or property transfer. If any information is incorrect, please inform your lawyer to correct the information submitted to IRAS.
