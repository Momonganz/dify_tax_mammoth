## Striking Off a Company

Companies are required to settle all outstanding tax liabilities and obligations with IRAS **before** applying for strike off with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). Otherwise, IRAS will object to your ACRA strike
off application and your strike off application will take longer to be cleared. Where IRAS’ objection is not resolved within 2 months from our objection date, companies will need to submit a **new** ACRA strike off application
again **after** IRAS’ objection is cleared.

You may make use of this [Step-by-Step Checklist](https://www.checkfirst.gov.sg/c/e76ed7f2-44e5-4194-857d-08f9da8c3d22) to find out whether the company has any outstanding tax matters with IRAS before proceeding to apply for strike off with ACRA. Learn more about the ACRA striking
off process and criteria at [ACRA’s website](https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/striking-off-a-local-company).

Companies’ tax liabilities and obligations are considered settled when:

1. All Corporate Income Tax Returns (Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C) are filed **up to the date of business cessation**. If your company is filing Form C, the (1) financial statements/ certified accounts and (2) tax computation(s)
    for the relevant Year of Assessment (YA) must also be submitted.

All outstanding tax matters are settled with IRAS (e.g. there are no outstanding queries from IRAS, assessments are finalised for all YAs and the related taxes and penalties (if any) are paid).

Do not close your company's bank accounts until all outstanding matters are settled. Once your company's bank account is closed and there is a tax credit (i.e. tax refund) owing to your company, IRAS will not be able to pay over the tax credit to a third
party (e.g. director, shareholder). When your company is dissolved, the tax credit due to your company will be paid over to the Insolvency Office. Your company’s shareholders may then approach the Insolvency Office if they wish to claim the
tax credit, and charges will be imposed by the Insolvency Office for the processing of the claim. Find out how to make a claim at the [Insolvency Office's website](https://io.mlaw.gov.sg/).

When your company has been successfully struck off and dissolved, you must ensure that all books and papers of your company are retained for a period of at least 5 years from the date on which your company was dissolved. This responsibility also falls
on any person who was an officer (generally referring to any director, secretary or person employed in an executive capacity) of your company immediately before your company was dissolved.

[**FAQs**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/dormant-companies-or-companies-closing-down/companies-applying-for-strike-off-to-cease-registration#faqs)

1. **My company ceased business during the financial year ending 31 Mar 2023 and intends to apply for strike off. If the company has used the** [Apply for Waiver/ File last Form C-S/ C (Dormant/ Striking Off)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/digital-services/companies-tax-agents) **digital service and filed the Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C, financial statements and tax computation up to the date of cessation of business (i.e. the Year of Assessment (YA) 2024), is it still required to file the Estimated Chargeable Income (ECI) for YA 2024?**

Your company is not required to file the ECI for YA 2024, as it has already filed the Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C, financial statements and tax computation for that YA. We will review and finalise the YA 2024 assessment based on the Form
    C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C, financial statements and tax computation filed.

2. **My company received a notification from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) informing us that IRAS has lodged an objection to the company’s striking off application. What should the company do?**

IRAS will lodge an objection to your company's application for strike off if your company has outstanding tax matters. Your company is required to resolve the objection on the outstanding tax matters within 2 months from the date the objection is lodged. Otherwise,
    your company's strike off application will lapse and you will need to apply to ACRA for strike off again.

3. **My company has been struck off/ has amalgamated with another company. Am I still able to access** [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx) **to view and/or download my company’s Corporate Income Tax notices?**

A company ceases to exist when it has been struck off or has amalgamated with another company and it is not the surviving entity of the amalgamation. Access to Corporate Income Tax digital services at [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx), including the [View Notices/ Letters - Corporate Tax](https://www.iras.gov.sg/digital-services/companies-tax-agents) digital service, will no longer be available as there is no further need for the company to transact with IRAS. Should your company require its Corporate Income Tax notices, you must arrange for the notices to be downloaded and saved prior
    to its strike off with ACRA or date of amalgamation.


## De-registration by Singapore Branches of Foreign Companies

Singapore branches of foreign companies must pay outstanding taxes and fulfil all tax obligations as part of the process of de-registering the branch.

[**Requirement to Settle Outstanding Tax Liabilities**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/dormant-companies-or-companies-closing-down/companies-applying-for-strike-off-to-cease-registration#requirement-to-settle-outstanding-tax-liabilities)

Section 377(1) of the Companies Act 1967 requires the Singapore branch of a foreign company to lodge a notice with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) within 7 days after it ceases to have a place of business or to carry on business
in Singapore.

The branch should also inform IRAS in writing at the same time that it informs ACRA so that the tax matters and tax liabilities of the Singapore branch can be settled.

The written notification to IRAS must include:

- Subject header 'Cessation of Business in Singapore'
- Date of cessation of business in Singapore in dd/mm/yyyy format
- Name and contact details of a person whom IRAS can liaise with on tax matters
- All outstanding Corporate Income Tax Returns (Form C), financial statements and tax computations up to the last day of business

Generally, IRAS strives to complete all assessments within 1 month of receipt of complete information. However, in the event that IRAS requires further information from branches with more complex affairs or the branches have submitted incomplete
information, IRAS may take up to 6 months to review the assessments. This [flowchart](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/timeline-for-companies-applying-for-strike-off-or-to-cease-registration2.pdf?sfvrsn=cf82e7be_9 "Timeline for Companies Applying for Strike off or to Cease Registration") (PDF, 148KB) illustrates the assessment process for branches that have ceased registration.
