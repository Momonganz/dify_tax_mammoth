## Applying for Special Accounting Periods

When you have financial accounting periods that do not start on the first day or end on the last day of calendar months, you may apply for special accounting periods for filing of your GST returns. Send your request via myTax Mail (log into [myTax Portal](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx)). Your request will be subject to IRAS’ approval.

[**Example of Special Accounting Periods**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/other-services/changing-gst-accounting-periods#example-of-special-accounting-periods)

If your financial year end is 28 Dec, you may request for the following special accounting periods:

| Filing frequency | Cycle of accounting periods for financial year ending 28 Dec |
| --- | --- |
| **Filing frequency** Quarterly | **Cycle of accounting periods for financial year ending 28 Dec** <br>29 Dec to 28 Mar<br>29 Mar to 28 Jun<br>29 Jun to 28 Sep<br>29 Sep to 28 Dec |

Please write in with your proposed special accounting periods for one year to us via myTax Mail (log in to [myTax Portal](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx "myTax Portal")), at
least 30 days before the start of the first accounting period. If we do not receive your request on time, you will be placed on the standard GST accounting periods by default.
