Businesses may make mistakes in their GST returns at various levels:

- Transaction level - e.g. wrong treatment applied or no supporting documents to substantiate the GST treatment; or
- GST reporting level - e.g. extracting wrong data for GST F5 reporting, specific GST adjustments such as input tax apportionment are not made on consolidated figures.

You are encouraged to conduct ASK Annual Review for GST returns filed in each financial year as regular reviews will help you detect errors early and avoid costly penalties.

Before conducting the ASK Annual Review, if you discover any GST errors in past GST returns, you should immediately rectify the errors and notify IRAS by filing GST F7 (i.e. "Disclosure of Errors on GST Return") for the affected periods. Please refer
to [Correct Mistakes in Past Returns](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/filing-gst/correcting-errors-made-in-gst-return-(filing-gst-f7)) for the guidelines and process on filing GST F7.

## Errors discovered from ASK Annual Review

IRAS will waive the 5% late payment penalty if you undertake ASK Annual Review to voluntarily disclose past error(s) within one year from the statutory filing date of your last GST return in respect for the financial year reviewed.

This is provided that all the qualifying conditions under the Voluntary Disclosure Programme (VDP) are met and the situation does not fall within the specific exclusions from the programme. For voluntary disclosures made after the one-year grace period,
IRAS will impose a reduced penalty of 5% of tax undercharged if the conditions under the VDP are met. For more information, please refer to [IRAS' Voluntary Disclosure Programme](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/getting-it-right/voluntary-disclosure-of-errors-for-reduced-penalties).

or tax year) basis or in your next GST F5 (if it qualifies for [Administrative Concession for Correcting Errors](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/filing-gst/correcting-errors-made-in-gst-return-(filing-gst-f7))). Thereafter, please submit your findings for our review.

## Please note the following

ASK Annual Review is designed as a guide for GST-registered businesses to conduct a self-review of their GST declarations. IRAS reserves the right to verify and extend the scope of checks beyond the sample checks performed by businesses according to this
Assisted Self-Help Kit ('ASK') Annual Review Guide. IRAS may also obtain additional information or documents in relation to the errors that have been disclosed. Should additional errors be detected during the course of IRAS' checks/audits, they will
not qualify for Voluntary Disclosure Programme.
