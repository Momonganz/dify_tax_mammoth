IRAS has three initiatives to help GST-registered businesses voluntarily comply - Tax Governance Framework (TGF), Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme (ACAP) and Assisted Self-Help Kit (ASK).

## **\[NEW!\]** Tax Governance Framework (TGF)

The [Tax Governance Framework (TGF)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/getting-it-right/tax-governance-and-tax-risk-management/tax-governance-framework-(-tgf-)) is an initiative that is applicable to both Corporate Income Tax and GST. It is an overarching framework that provides the guiding principles and key practices which a company can adopt in its tax governance policy, as part of overall good corporate
governance.

Companies that have adopted TGF and obtained IRAS’ endorsement may enjoy a one-time extended grace period for voluntary disclosure of Corporate Income Tax errors, Withholding Tax errors and GST errors.

## Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme (ACAP)

Businesses that have obtained ACAP status enjoy benefits such as three to five years of exemption from GST audits, faster GST refunds, speedier resolution of GST issues and automatic renewal of GST schemes.

### Background

[Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme (ACAP)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/getting-it-right/voluntary-compliance-initiatives/assisted-compliance-assurance-programme-(acap) "Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme (ACAP)")[Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme (ACAP)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/getting-it-right/voluntary-compliance-initiatives/assisted-compliance-assurance-programme-(acap)), launched on 5 Apr 2011, provides a holistic framework for businesses to proactively self-manage their GST risks and treat tax risk management as part of their corporate governance
framework.

## Assisted Self-help Kit (ASK)

[Assisted Self-help Kit (ASK)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/getting-it-right/voluntary-compliance-initiatives/assisted-self-help-kit-(ask) "Assisted Self-help Kit (ASK)") is a comprehensive self-assessment compliance package to help businesses review correctness of GST submission and discover past GST errors early to qualify for [IRAS' Voluntary Disclosure Programme](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/getting-it-right/voluntary-disclosure-of-errors-for-reduced-penalties "IRAS' Voluntary Disclosure Programme").

ASK is available to all GST-registered businesses.
