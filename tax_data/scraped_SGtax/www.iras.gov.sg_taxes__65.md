## FATCA Filing Requirements

Under the FATCA Regulations, a Reporting SGFI is required to submit annual FATCA return(s) to IRAS setting out the required information in relation to every US Reportable Account that is maintained by the SGFI. Reporting SGFIs that did not maintain any
US Reportable Accounts in the relevant reporting year are required to file a nil return to IRAS.

## Due Date for Filing

All Reporting Singaporean Financial Institution (SGFIs) must submit their FATCA returns, including nil returns (if applicable) by **31 May** of the year following the calendar year to which the return relates.

## How to submit a FATCA return

From 11 Apr 2021, you will be required to log in to government digital services for businesses (G2B) using Singpass instead of Corppass. For more information, visit [Corppass](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/cpauth/login/homepage?URL=%2F&TAM_OP=login "Corppass") website.

**Step 1: Authorise users for FATCA Filing**

Before filing the FATCA returns, please ensure that you have been authorised by the Reporting SGFI as an “Approver” for Automatic Exchange of Information (CRS and FATCA) Digital Services in Corppass. In authorising "Approver" in Corppass,
Corppass Admin should leave the "Effective Reporting Year From" and "Effective Reporting Year To" fields as blank for the "Approver" to enable the "Approver" to submit returns for all Reporting Years.

For Non-UEN entities (e.g. Singaporean/foreign trusts or funds), the entity would have to first appoint a Corppass Admin via this link.

In addition to the steps above on the AEOI Digital Services authorisation, the Corppass Admin would also have to authorise the user as an "Approver" for the "For non-UEN entities only" Digital Services in order to access the AEOI services on myTax Portal. For more details, please refer to the [guide](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/corppass-step-by-step-update-for-non-uen-entities.pdf?sfvrsn=f455e8e3_5 "Corppass Step by Step update for Non-UEN entities"). For assistance on Corppass setup, please refer to the [step-by-step guides](https://www.iras.gov.sg/digital-services/others/corppass "step-by-step guides").
