## What is estate income

Assets left behind by a deceased person may continue to produce income after their death. The deceased person's assets, as a whole, are called an estate.

Estate income refers to the income derived a day after the date of death until the end of the [administration period](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/trusts/guide-for-administrators-or-trustees/estate-under-administration-or-held-in-trust "administration period") .

## What is trust income

Trust income may arise from assets held in trust by trustees of the following:

- Private trusts created by way of Trust Deeds/Settlements
- Trusts created under the Wills of deceased persons
- Intestate estates (where the deceased died without a will)
