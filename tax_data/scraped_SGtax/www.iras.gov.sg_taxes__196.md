## Meal Allowance/Reimbursement for Working Overtime

Overtime meal allowance and reimbursement paid to employees in 2005 and subsequent years are **not taxable** provided:

1. It is for working beyond official working hours (whether during weekdays, off days, weekends and public holidays) on an ad hoc basis; and
2. The payment policy is generally available to all staff. The payments are also not taxable if the policy applies only to staff at the lower level.
