## Obligation to file tax

Individuals are taxed based on the income earned in the preceding calendar year. Filing for the Year of Assessment begins on 1 Mar and you must file your Income tax Return by 18 Apr.

Generally, there are 2 groups of taxpayers:

- those who are required to file an Income Tax Return, and
- those who are on the No-Filing Service.

| **Type of notification received** | **Action required** |
| --- | --- |
| ****Type of notification received**** If you receive any letter, form or SMS informing you to **file an Income Tax Return** | **Action required** <br>You **must file** regardless of:<br>- the amount of your annual income in the previous year; or<br>- whether your employer is participating in the [Auto-Inclusion Scheme for Employment Income](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/employers/auto-inclusion-scheme-(ais)-for-employment-income "Auto-Inclusion Scheme for Employment Income"). |
| ****Type of notification received**** If you receive a letter or SMS informing you that you have been selected for the **No-Filing Service** | **Action required** You are **not required** to file an Income Tax Return. You may choose to log in to [myTax Portal](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/login/selection "myTax Portal") to preview<br> your tax bill, also known as the Notice of Assessment, and request for an early assessment by 18 Apr. Otherwise, your tax bill (digital or paper format) will be sent to you from end Apr onwards.<br>Your tax bill is computed<br> based on your auto-included income and previous year’s relief claims, if any, which may be adjusted if you do not meet the eligibility criteria. It is your responsibility to ensure that your tax bill is accurate.<br>If<br> you have any other income that is not shown in the tax bill, or your relief claims in the tax bill are incorrect, please inform us via the " [Amend Tax Bill](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/portal/individual/assessment/amend-overview "Object to Assessment")" digital service at [myTax Portal](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/login/selection "myTax Portal") within 30 days from the date<br> of your tax bill. Alternatively, please [email](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/portal/correspondence/mytax-mail "email") us the details of your amendments if you are unable to use the<br> digital service. |

You may be selected for the Direct Notice of Assessment initiative if you only had auto-included income in the previous year. You do not need to file an Income Tax Return. Your tax bill would be computed based on your income provided by your employer and previous year’s relief claims. A taxpayer selected to receive the Notice of Assessment without the need to file has a legal duty to inform IRAS of any inaccurate information on his income and/or relief claims in his tax bill. There are penalties for failing to do so.

## Digital services for individuals

Please use the [Digital services (Individuals)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/digital-services/employees "Digital services (Individuals)") for filing, paying and
managing your taxes.

## Tax clearance for foreigners

You must settle all your taxes if you are about to leave Singapore or change to another job within Singapore. This process is known as [tax clearance](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/employees/scenario-based-faqs-for-working-in-singapore-and-abroad/tax-clearance-for-non-singapore-citizen-employees "tax clearance"). Your current employer must notify IRAS and ensure you have paid all taxes before you cease employment
with them.

If you still hold any existing stock options or awards on hand which have yet to be exercised or vested, you will be considered to have derived gains from the stock or awards at the point of tax clearance.

If you anticipate a refund, please [register for PayNow FIN](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/refunds#title39 "register for PayNow FIN") for faster
processing.
