Residential properties that are owner-occupied enjoy lower tax rates than residential properties that are not occupied by the owner(s).

## Lower property tax rates for owner-occupied residential properties

Owner-occupied residential properties enjoy lower tax rates than those not occupied by the owner. The lower owner-occupier tax rates are to encourage home ownership in Singapore.

The tax rates are progressive, where residential properties assessed with higher annual value  are taxed at higher rates.

To check the tax rates applied on your property, refer to the tax rate indicator stated in your latest property tax bill. If the concession has been applied to your property, it will indicate "Owner-Occupier Tax Rates". You may also check the tax
rates on our ['View Property Summary'](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/portal/property/view-property-summary)
digital service.

## Who qualifies for owner-occupier tax rates

You (as an individual or a married couple) must own and reside in the residential property to qualify for owner-occupier tax rates. If you are a married couple that owns 2 homes, the concession can only be applied
to 1 home. Please note that even if a married couple were to occupy two homes, the owner-occupier tax rates can only apply to one of the homes. This is regardless of whether it is owned jointly or separately by the spouses.

The owner-occupier tax rates are **not applicable** in any of the following scenarios:

1. You have wholly rented out your property;
2. You have sold the property;
3. The residential property is owned by a company, trust, association or a body of persons; and
4. The property is a commercial or industrial building or land.
5. The property is vacant.
6. The property is held under trust and the trustee is not residing in the property.
7.  The property is not occupied by the owner(s) in our valuation list.

### Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Owning more than 1 home**

If you own a private property or HDB flat (A) and recently purchased another private property (B), you can apply for the owner-occupier tax rates for property (B) if you are living in it. The concession on property (A) will cease from the date you
start enjoying the owner-occupier tax rates on property (B).

**Scenario 2: Owning a property with a non-spouse**

If you jointly own 2 residential properties (A and B) with another party other than your spouse (e.g. parents, siblings, etc.), you can apply for concession for **each** of the property.

Example: If you occupy residential property (A) and your parents occupy residential property (B), you can apply for the owner-occupier tax rates for property (A) and your parents can apply for the concession for property (B).

**Scenario 3: Renting part of your home**

If you partially let out your home while still living in it, you are still eligible for the owner-occupier tax rates.

**Scenario 4: Deceased owner**

The owner-occupier tax rates apply only when the owner owns and lives in the residential property.

When the owner passes away, the Legal personal representative should complete the legal transfer of the property to the beneficiaries as soon as possible. Owner-occupier tax rates may then apply, depending on the new ownership structure.

When the owner of a residential property that qualifies for owner-occupier tax rates passes away, IRAS will continue to apply the concession for up to 2 years from the owner’s passing or the date of transfer of the property, whichever is earlier. This automatic extension of the concessionary tax rates is to allow some time for the property transfer arrangements to be made.  The tax rates will be adjusted to higher non-owner-occupier tax rates if the property remains to be held by the estate of the deceased person after the 2-year extension or if the property is wholly tenanted during the 2 years concession period. Once the property transfer arrangements are completed, if the new owner moves in to reside in the property, he/she can then apply for the owner-occupier tax rates from the date of occupation.

If the property is legally constrained from being transferred to the beneficiaries (e.g. the beneficiary is below the legal age of 21 to own a HDB flat etc.), you can submit an appeal via email with this [template](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/template-for-properties-held-under-deceased-ownership.pdf?sfvrsn=860d0_10 "Appeal to extend Owner-Occupier Tax Rates for Properties held under Deceased ownership")(PDF,
42KB) for the owner-occupier tax rates to continue to apply to the property. Beneficiaries have to be residing in  the property and not be enjoying owner-occupier tax rates on another property to qualify for the concession.

**Scenario 5:** **Properties held in Trust**

If you are holding the property in trust, you (trustee) are updated as the owner in the Valuation List for property tax purpose. The owner-occupier tax rates will not be applicable if the owner (who is entered in the Valuation List) is not residing in the property.

**Scenario 6:** **Properties not occupied by the owner(s) in our valuation list**

The owner entered in the Valuation List must reside in the residential property for the property to qualify for the owner-occupier tax rates. Residential properties which are not occupied by the owner will not be eligible for this concession and the property will be taxed at the non-owner-occupier residential tax rates.

## Automatic application of owner-occupier tax rates

Owner-occupier tax rates will automatically apply to:

1. **Buyers of new/ resale HDB, DBSS flats and new executive condominiums.**
2. **Buyers of private residential property\***

If you are a Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident who has purchased a new or resale private residential property, the owner-occupier tax rates are automatically applied
    when you and your spouse are not currently enjoying owner-occupier tax rates on any other residential property.

**\*** _This initiative started from 1 Jan 2011_

Once you have rented out your property, the owner-occupier tax rates are no longer applicable from the date of rental and non-owner-occupier residential tax rates apply as you are not residing in the property.

As your mother has rented out her property, the owner-occupier tax rates are not applicable, and the property tax is payable based on the residential tax rate. While we appreciate that she has reasons for not staying in her property, we regret that we are unable to accede to her request to reinstate the owner-occupier tax rates to the property.

You may apply for the owner-occupier tax rates via our digital service once your tenant moves out of your property, and you plan to move into the property. Please note that the owner-occupier tax rates applied to you or your spouse’s existing property will be withdrawn once the new application is approved.

No. For residential properties held under deceased ownership, IRAS will extend the concessionary rates for a period of two years from date of the owner’s demise to allow some time for the property transfer/sale arrangements to be made before the non-owner-occupier residential tax rates are applied.


[**Our late brother’s property was rented out prior to his passing.

No. As the owner-occupier tax rates were not applied on the residential property prior to the owner’s passing (i.e. the property was rented out or vacant), the concession is not applicable, and the property will continue to be taxed at the non-owner-occupier residential tax rates. Please arrange to have the property legally transferred to the beneficiaries. IRAS will review the OOTR based on the new owner’s eligibility.

No. Under the Property Tax Act, any claims for refund of tax paid are limited to 5 preceding years from the year you submitted your OOTR application. This is to ensure finality of tax assessments between the Government and taxpayers. We are unable to accede to any appeals for further refunds beyond 5 back years. Please ensure that claims for OOTR are made on a timely basis, i.e. within 5 years of OOTR eligibility, to qualify for a full refund.

If your property was vacant pending the next tenancy, the Owner-Occupier Tax Rates are not applicable. Property tax remains payable based on residential tax rates. However, if you have moved in to stay for this period, please [write to us](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/portal/correspondence/mytax-mail) together with your confirmation that you have been residing
in the property and provide us with the documentary evidence.
