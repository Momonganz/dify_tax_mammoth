## Clearance Directive

Upon tax clearance, you will receive either a Directive to Pay Tax or a Notification to Release Monies. The [Clearance Directive](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/employers/tax-clearance-for-foreign-spr-employees-(ir21)/clearance-directives "Clearance Directive") will be issued to you by post. You will receive it within five to seven working days.

Separately, an electronic copy of the Clearance Directive will be made available at [myTax Portal](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx "myTax Portal") within
three working days from the date the Form IR21 is processed.
