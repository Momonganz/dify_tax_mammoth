## Group Insurance Premium Paid by Employers

To find out the beneficiary, check the policy document or check with the insurance provider.

### Employer Not Under Legal Obligation to Payout to Employee

Employer has taken up a group term life insurance policy for the employees who are not the named beneficiary.

The premiums are **not taxable** if the employer (policyholder) has a choice or the discretion to decide whether he wants to disburse the insurance payout from the group insurance policy to the employee or his next-of-kin.

### Employer Under Legal Obligation to Payout to Employee

The employees will be **subject to tax** on the share of benefits of premium paid if the employer is under legal obligation to disburse the payout to the employee in the event of claim.

Documents such as the employment contract, HR policy, staff handbook, collective agreement etc could contain the details of the contractual obligation by the employer.

### Administrative Concession Effective YA 2013

Effective YA 2013, for group insurance policy where the employees are entitled to the payout contractually, employer can take up an administrative concession where the **employees will not be taxed on the premiums** , provided
the
**employer does not claim a tax deduction** for the said group insurance premiums in the corporate/business tax filing for the relevant year.

No upfront approval for this administrative concession is required. Once the employer avails himself of the administrative concession, he should apply the treatment consistently for all employees covered by the group insurance policy (i.e. employer
cannot choose to report the staff benefit on the share of premiums paid for only some employees covered by the group insurance policy and claim a partial deduction of premium paid in their corporate/business tax filing).

### Preparation of IR8A

When an employer does not take up the administrative concession and the beneficiary is the employee or the employer is under contractual arrangement to give the insurance payout to the employee or his next-of-kin, the employee will be taxed on the
amount of premium attributable to him.

When preparing IR8A, attribution can be done using average premium per staff or any other appropriate method which is reasonable and consistent across years.
