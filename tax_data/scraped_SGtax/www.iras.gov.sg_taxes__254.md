[**My husband and I are co-owners of a property. Why do we see two amounts when we log in to myTax Portal? Are both owners required to pay?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/property-tax/other-services/check-outstanding-tax#my-husband-and-i-are-co-owners-of-a-property--why-do-we-see-two-amounts-when-we-log-in-to-mytax-portal--are-both-owners-required-to-pay-)

Property tax is a tax levied on property ownership. The payment arrangement on the property tax payable is a private matter to be settled among the property owners. If one of the owners has made payment, the co-owner is not required to make another payment for the same property.

Both owners will be able to view the same amount in myTax Portal as it is tied to the same property.
