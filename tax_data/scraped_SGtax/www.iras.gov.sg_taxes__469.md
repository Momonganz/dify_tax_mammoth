Gains and profits arising from Employee Share Options (ESOP) plans and other forms of Employee Share Ownership (ESOW) plans are subject to tax if the plans are granted to an employee when he/she is employed in Singapore.

On this page:

## Employee Share Option (ESOP) and other forms of Employee Share Ownership (ESOW)

### Employee Share Option (ESOP)

An ESOP plan gives an employee the right to purchase shares in a company (usually the employer or a parent company of the employer) at a specific pre-determined price on or after specific dates under the plan.

An employee who is granted rights under an ESOP plan by an employer will be taxed on any gains or profits arising from the ESOP plan. Generally, this is when the share options under the plan are exercised by the employee.

### Other forms of Employee Share Ownership (ESOW)

ESOW plans allow an employee to own or purchase shares in a company (usually the employer or a parent company of the employer). They include share awards plans where shares are credited to the employee after a period of time (commonly referred to as a
vesting period).

ESOW plans do not include plans where an employee receives cash payments that are linked to the price of shares in a company, but there is no possibility (under the plan) for the employee to receive shares in the company (commonly referred to as phantom
share plans).

An employee who is granted rights under an ESOW plan by an employer will be taxed on any gains or profits arising from the ESOW plan. Generally, this is when the shares under the plan vest for the employee.

The above applies equally to ESOP/ESOW plans that are:

1. Granted by an overseas parent company operating a group ESOP/ESOW plan (i.e. the plan is not administered by the Singapore employer of the employee); or
2. Granted to a person as a result of any office held by him, for example, as a director of a company (i.e. there is no contract of employment between the taxpayer and the company that grants the rights under the plan).

## Taxable gains from ESOP and ESOW

### ESOP plans

Generally, the gains are taxable when the share options are exercised by the employee. This is the case even if the employee has ended his employment with the employer or if the employee has been posted overseas and is no longer employed in Singapore.
For an employee who is not a Singapore Citizen, a “deemed exercise” rule\[1\] is applied when the employee is no longer employed in Singapore so that tax is payable at that time.

If the ESOP plan imposes any restriction on the sale of the shares (acquired under the share options), the gains are taxable in the year when that restriction ends. This does not apply if the “deemed exercise” rule\[1\] had already
been applied when the employee was no longer employed in Singapore.

### ESOW plans with no vesting period imposed

Generally, the gains are taxable in the year when the shares are granted.

However, if the ESOW plan imposes any restriction on the sale of the shares, the gains are taxable in the year when that restriction ends.

### ESOP plans/ESOW plans granted with vesting period imposed

Generally, the gains are taxable when the shares vest for the employee. This is the case even if the employee has ended his employment with the employer or if the employee has been posted overseas and is no longer employed in Singapore. For an employee
who is not a Singapore Citizen, a “deemed exercise” rule\[1\] is applied when the employee is no longer employed in Singapore so that tax is payable at that time.

If the ESOP/ESOW plan imposes any restriction on the sale of the shares, the gains are taxable in the year when that restriction ends. This does not apply if the “deemed exercise” rule\[1\] had already been applied when the employee
was no longer employed in Singapore.

## Computing gains from ESOP and ESOW

### If the ESOP/ESOW plan imposes any restriction on the sale of the shares

Gains from ESOP/ESOW plan = Open market price of the shares on the date the selling restriction ends less any price paid for the shares

### If the ESOP/ESOW plan does not impose any restriction on the sale of the shares

Gains from ESOP plan = Open market price of shares on the **date of exercise** less any price paid for the shares (exercise price)

Gains from ESOW plan (with a vesting period) = Open market price of shares on the **date of vesting** less any price paid for the shares

Gains from ESOW plan (with no vesting period) = Open market price of shares on the **date of grant** less any price paid for the shares

Mr Lim exercised his share options. Below is the amount of his gains from the ESOP plan:

| **Gains from ESOP plan** | **Amount** |
| --- | --- |
| **Gains from ESOP plan**<br>**Open market price per share on date of exercise**<br>**(a)** | **Amount** $10 |
| **Gains from ESOP plan**<br>**Exercise price per share**<br>**(b)** | **Amount** $5 |
| **Gains from ESOP plan**<br>**Number of shares acquired**<br>**(c)** | **Amount** 100 |
| **Gains from ESOP plan**<br>**Gains from ESOP plan**<br>**\[(a) - (b)\] x (c)** | **Amount** 500 |

## Equity Remuneration Incentive Schemes (ERIS)

Equity Remuneration Incentive Schemes (ERIS) provide tax incentives to employees who derive gains from ESOP and ESOW plans granted by their employers. There are 3 types of ERIS:

- ERIS (Start-ups)
- ERIS (SMEs)
- ERIS (All corporations)

As announced in the Budget Statement for 2013, ERIS will be phased out to rationalise the tax treatment of remuneration for employees.

## Reporting gains
