## Loans to Company Directors

Benefits that directors derive from loans are taxable. The Income Tax Act regards company directors as employees thus the benefits from interest-free / subsidised loans are taxable as employment benefits.

### Computing Interest Benefits

### From Year of Assessment (YA) 2024

To compute the value of interest benefits from 1 April 2023,  please use a rate that is 1.5%-point above the 3-month compounded ‘Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA)’ published by [Monetary Authority of Singapore](https://www.mas.gov.sg/) on 1 March and 1 September each year. The relevant interest rates for computing the value of interest benefits are:

| Period | Interest rate |
| --- | --- |
| **Period** January to March 2023 (Average Prime Leading Rate) | **Interest rate** 5.5% |
| **Period** April to September 2023 | **Interest rate** 4.7% |
| **Period** October to December 2023 | **Interest rate** 5.1% |
| **Period** January to March 2024 | **Interest rate** 5.1% |
| **Period** April to September 2024 | **Interest rate** 5.1% |
| **Period** October to December 2024 | **Interest rate** 5.0% |

### Year of Assessment (YA) 2023 and before

For simplicity, IRAS may accept computation based on the amount of loan outstanding as at 31 December of each year multiplied by the average prime lending rate for that year.

### Average Prime Lending Rate

| Year | Average Prime Lending Rate (%) |
| --- | --- |
| **Year** 2020 | **Average Prime Lending Rate (%)** 5.25 |
| **Year** 2021 | **Average Prime Lending Rate (%)** 5.25 |
| **Year** 2022 | **Average Prime Lending Rate (%)** 5.25 |

If the loan were taken for less than one calendar year, the interest benefits would be computed according to the number of months in that year for which the loans remain outstanding.

A company director was provided with an interest-free loan of $100,000 from January 2020 to October 2022, the amount of interest benefit for each Year of Assessment (YA) would be as follows:

| Year of Assessment (YA) | Outstanding Loan | Average Prime Lending Rate (%) | Amount of Interest Benefit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Year of Assessment (YA)** 2021 | **Outstanding Loan** <br>$100,000 | **Average Prime Lending Rate (%)** <br>5.25 | **Amount of Interest Benefit** <br>$100,000 x 5.25% = $5,250 |
| **Year of Assessment (YA)** <br>2022 | **Outstanding Loan** <br>$100,000 | **Average Prime Lending Rate (%)** 5.25 | **Amount of Interest Benefit** <br>$100,000 x 5.25% = $5,250 |
| **Year of Assessment (YA)** <br>2023 | **Outstanding Loan** <br>$100,000 | **Average Prime Lending Rate (%)** 5.25 | **Amount of Interest Benefit** <br>$100,000 x 5.25% x 10/12 = $4,375 |
