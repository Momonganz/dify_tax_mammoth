## Auctioneer

An auctioneer is a person who helps owners (commonly known as consignors) to offer their goods for sale by way of auction.

## Selling goods to satisfy a debt (mortgagee sale)

Where the auctioneer is appointed by the creditor (e.g. mortgagee) to sell goods in satisfaction of a debt owed by owner of the goods, **the supply is treated as made by the owner of the goods.**

### Providing statement to IRAS within 21 days

If the owner is GST-registered, you are required to collect GST on the sale and provide a statement of sale and remit the GST due to IRAS **within 21 days** from the date of sale.

For more details on procedures, please refer to [Selling/renting out asset in satisfaction of debt](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/charging-gst-(output-tax)/common-scenarios---do-i-charge-gst/selling-renting-assets-to-recover-debts "Selling/renting out asset in satisfaction of debt") .

### Zero-rating supplies

For goods that are **exported**, you may **zero-rate** the supply (i.e. charge GST at 0%) if the export is supported with required export documents stated in:

- [GST: A Guide on Exports](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguides_gst_exports_2013-12-31(1).pdf?sfvrsn=ecabfc4b_36 "Guide on Exports (Seventh Edition)") (PDF, 813KB); or

## Selling goods not to satisfy a debt

### Selling goods in your own name

Where the owner of the goods consigns the goods directly to you and you sell it in your own name without disclosing the identity of the owner, you will be treated as the **principal** when you sell the goods.

Therefore, the sale of goods is your taxable supply (and not that of the owner). You have to charge and account for GST on the sale of goods.

For goods that are exported, you may zero-rate the supply (i.e. charge GST at 0%) if you maintain the required export documents stated in:

- [GST: A Guide on Exports](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguides_gst_exports_2013-12-31(1).pdf?sfvrsn=ecabfc4b_36 "Guide on Exports (Seventh Edition)") (PDF, 813KB); or

If you operate the [Tourist Refund Scheme](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/general-gst-schemes/tourist-refund-scheme-(for-retailers) "Tourist Refund Scheme"), a tourist who makes a purchase from you and departs with the goods from Singapore via Changi International Airport or Seletar Airport, can be eligible for GST refund under the scheme.

### Importing and selling goods on behalf of a non-GST registered overseas person

Where a non-GST registered overseas person consigns goods which you import and sell on his behalf, you are **acting as the agent** to the overseas person under section 33(2) of the GST Act.

For GST purpose, you will be **treated as the principal** when you sell the goods. Therefore, the sale of goods is your taxable supply. You have to charge and account for GST on the sale of goods.

For goods that are exported, you may zero-rate the supply (i.e. charge GST at 0%) if you maintain the required export documents stated in:

- [GST: A Guide on Exports](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguides_gst_exports_2013-12-31(1).pdf?sfvrsn=ecabfc4b_36 "GST: A Guide on Exports") (PDF, 813KB); or

If you operate the [Tourist Refund Scheme](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/general-gst-schemes/tourist-refund-scheme-(for-retailers) "Tourist Refund Scheme"), a tourist who makes a purchase from you and departs with the goods from Singapore via Changi International Airport or Seletar Airport, can be eligible for GST refund under the scheme.

### Selling goods in the name of the owner

Where you act as an agent and offer the owner's goods for sale in the name of the owner, the goods will be **treated as sold by the owner**. The GST treatment on the sale depends on whether the owner is GST-registered.

If the **owner of the goods is GST-registered**, GST is chargeable on goods sold in Singapore. The GST-registered owner has to issue a tax invoice to the buyer and account for GST in his GST return.

## Services provided by auctioneer

You may provide auction service and other incidental services in connection with the auction goods (e.g. insurance, valuation, restoration, picture framing, catalogue illustrations services) to the owner/consignor and the buyer of the goods.

### Services related to goods situated outside Singapore at time of auction

Where an auction is held in Singapore, but the goods are kept outside Singapore at the time the service is performed, the auction service provided qualifies as an **international service** under Section 21(3)(f) of the GST Act.

Therefore, you may **zero-rate** the supply of auction service (i.e. charge GST at 0%).

### Services related to goods situated in Singapore at time of auction

1. Services provided to the owner (consignor) of the goods



You have to **charge GST** on these services.



If these services are provided to an overseas owner and the auction goods are for export, you may **zero-rate** the supply of these services (i.e. charge GST at 0%) under Section 21(3)(g) of the GST Act. You need to maintain the required export documents.
