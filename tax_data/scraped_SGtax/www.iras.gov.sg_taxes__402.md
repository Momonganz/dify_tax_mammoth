## Zero-rating of supplies relating to ships

You need to charge GST on services that you provide. Where the supplies qualify as international services under Section 21(3) of the GST Act, you may zero-rate your supply of service (i.e. charge GST at 0%).

### International transport of passengers or goods by sea

Transportation of passengers or goods by sea:

1. from a place outside Singapore to another place outside Singapore;
2. from a place in Singapore to international waters; or
3. from international waters to a place in Singapore.

Freight-related charges (e.g. bill of lading fee) and container-related charges (e.g. demurrage and detention fees) billed by shipping lines are considered as ancillary to international transportation.

Yes. The input GST can be claimed if you can satisfy all the [conditions for input tax claim](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/conditions-for-claiming-input-tax "conditions for input tax claim").

[**I provide repair and maintenance to a Singapore registered ship in Singapore. The ship is not a passenger harbour craft or pleasure craft. Can I zero-rate the supply of services?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/specific-business-sectors/marine-and-shipping#i-provide-repair-and-maintenance-to-a-singapore-registered-ship-in-singapore--the-ship-is-not-a-passenger-harbour-craft-or-pleasure-craft--can-i-zero-rate-the-supply-of-services-)

Yes. You may zero-rate your supply of repair and maintenance services if:

1. The repair or maintenance is carried out on board the ship;
2. Any part or component of the ship is removed for repair and:
1. Reinstalled on the ship, or returned onto the ship as spare; or
2. Delivered to:
      1. A shipyard situated in Singapore; or
      2. An approved marine customer; or
3. Any part or component of the ship is removed and repaired by way of an exchange with an identical part or component, with the identical part or component being:
1. Installed on the ship, or brought onto the ship as a spare; or

[**I have a contract to build a ship. I will out-source part of the ship-building services to a GST-registered subcontractor. What are the GST implications?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/specific-business-sectors/marine-and-shipping#i-have-a-contract-to-build-a-ship--i-will-out-source-part-of-the-ship-building-services-to-a-gst-registered-subcontractor--what-are-the-gst-implications-)

Your supply of the ship (i.e. contract to build) may be zero-rated. However, when your sub-contractor bills you for its ship-building services done, your sub-contractor must standard-rate the supply to you.

If you purchase goods to be used or installed on a ship under construction and the goods are delivered directly to the shipyard, the supplier can zero-rate its supply to you, provided that it can maintain the documentary requirements.
