## General Corporate Income Tax Rules

Corporate Income Tax is assessed on a preceding year basis in Singapore. Singapore’s Corporate Income Tax rate is 17%.

[**Definition of a Company**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/basic-guide-to-corporate-income-tax-for-companies#definition-of-a-company)

For income tax purposes, the following is considered a company:

- A business entity incorporated or registered under the Companies Act 1967 or any law in force in Singapore. It usually has the words 'Pte Ltd' or 'Ltd' as part of its name
- A foreign company registered in Singapore such as a branch of a foreign company
- A foreign company incorporated or registered outside Singapore

A sole-proprietorship or partnership business is not considered a company.

[**Basis Period & Year of Assessment**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/basic-guide-to-corporate-income-tax-for-companies#basis-period---year-of-assessment)

Your company is taxed on the income earned in the preceding financial year.

This means that income earned in the financial year 2020 will be taxed in 2021. In tax terms, 2021 is the **Year of Assessment (YA)**, as it is the year in which your company’s income is assessed to tax.

To assess the amount of tax, IRAS looks at the income, expenses, etc. during the financial year. This financial year is known as the ' **basis period**'.

The basis period is generally a 12-month period preceding the YA.

#### Examples of Basis Periods Based on Different Financial Year Ends

* * *

The [financial year end](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/updating-company-particulars) is determined by your company based on what
best suits its business operations. IRAS does not determine the financial year end for companies.

If you change your company’s financial year end, the change must be filed with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA)
via [BizFile+](https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/). IRAS will then update its records based on the information filed with ACRA.

[**Corporate Income Tax Rate**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/basic-guide-to-corporate-income-tax-for-companies#corporate-income-tax-rate)

Your company is taxed at a flat rate of **17%** of its chargeable income. This applies to both local and foreign companies.

### Chargeable Income

Chargeable income refers to your company's taxable income (after deducting tax-allowable expenses) for a Year of Assessment (YA).

## Corporate Income Tax Filing Obligations

Your company has to file 2 Corporate Income Tax Returns with IRAS every year: Estimated Chargeable Income (ECI) and Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C.

You will receive an ECI filing notification before the end of your company’s financial year\*. This is a reminder to file your company’s ECI.

Learn more about [ECI](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/estimated-chargeable-income-(eci)-filing) and whether your company qualifies for the ECI filing waiver
or is specifically not required to file.

\\* If your company has changed its financial year end, you are required to update the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) via the [Change of Financial Year End](http://www.bizfile.gov.sg/) digital service at
[BizFile+](http://www.bizfile.gov.sg/). Learn more about [updating company particulars](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/updating-company-particulars).

### For New Companies

You will receive the ECI filing notification from IRAS before the end of your company’s financial year, starting from the year after the year of incorporation. You will not receive the notification in the year of incorporation, as most companies
do not close their first set of accounts in the year of incorporation. For example, if your company is incorporated in 2021 and has a Dec financial year end, you will receive your first ECI filing notification for the Year of Assessment (YA) 2023
in Dec 2022.

However, if your company closes its first set of accounts in the year of incorporation, you are still required to file the ECI within 3 months from your company's first financial year end, even though you have not received any ECI filing notification.
This is so unless the company qualifies for the [ECI filing waiver](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/estimated-chargeable-income-(eci)-filing).

Using the same example above, if your company closes its first set of accounts on 31 Dec 2021 and does not qualify for the [ECI filing waiver](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/estimated-chargeable-income-(eci)-filing),
you are required to file the ECI for YA 2022 by 31 Mar 2022 (within 3 months from 31 Dec 2021).

#### Example

Company A is incorporated on 15 Jul 2021 and has a Dec financial year end.

| Scenario | First Set of Accounts | Due Date to File First ECI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scenario** A: Closes its first set of accounts in the year of incorporation | **First Set of Accounts** 15 Jul 2021 to 31 Dec 2021 | **Due Date to File First ECI** File for YA 2022 (basis period from 15 Jul 2021 to 31 Dec 2021) by 31 Mar 2022 |
| **Scenario** B: Does not close its first set of accounts in the year of incorporation | **First Set of Accounts** 15 Jul 2021 to 31 Dec 20221 | **Due Date to File First ECI**<br>File for<br>1. YA 2022 (basis period from 15 Jul 2021 to 31 Dec 2021); and<br>2. YA 2023 (basis period from 1 Jan 2022 to 31 Dec 2022) <br>together by 31 Mar 2023 |

1 As the company's first set of accounts covers a period of more than 12 months from the date of incorporation, its [profit/ losses must be attributed](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/basic-guide-to-corporate-income-tax-for-companies#attribution-of-profits--losses-for-new-companies) and declared under
2 YAs.


Time apportionment basis may be used if the company is not able to directly identify income and expenses to the 2 periods.

2 For both scenarios, the company will receive its first ECI filing notification for YA
2023 in Dec 2022. There will be no notification for YA 2022.

[**Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C Filing**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/basic-guide-to-corporate-income-tax-for-companies#form-c-s--form-c-s--lite---form-c-filing)

You will receive a Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C filing notification by May of each year. This is a reminder to file your company’s Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C by 30 Nov of the year.

Learn more about [Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/form-c-s-form-c-s-(lite)-form-c-filing/overview-of-form-c-s-form-c-s-(lite)-form-c) and whether your company should file Form C-S, Form C-S (Lite) or Form C.

### For New Companies

For companies that close first set of accounts after year of incorporation

You will receive the Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C filing notification from IRAS by May of each year, starting from the second year after the year of incorporation\*. You will not receive the notification in the year of incorporation, as most companies
do not close their first set of accounts in the year of incorporation. For example, if your company is incorporated in 2023, you will receive your first Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C filing notification for the Year of Assessment (YA) 2025 by
May 2025.

For companies that close first set of accounts in the year of incorporation

However, if in the year of incorporation, your company:

- Closes its first set of accounts; and
- Commences business or receives any income;

you are still required to file the Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C for the YA immediately after the year of incorporation, even though you have not received any Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C filing notification.

For such cases, please fill out the [Request for Income Tax Return for Newly Incorporated Companies](https://form.gov.sg/671713ebc575e025a6072f39).

Using the same example above, if your company closes its first set of accounts on 31 Dec 2023, and commences business or receives income in 2023, you are required to file the Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C for YA 2024 by 30 Nov 2024.

\\* This is only applicable for newly incorporated companies. Singapore branches of foreign companies will be issued the Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C filing notifications after the first year of business. For example, if your branch is registered in
Singapore in 2023, you will receive your first Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C filing notification for YA 2024 by May 2024.

#### Example

Company A is incorporated on 15 Jul 2021 and has a Dec financial year end.

| Scenario | First Set of Accounts | Due Date to File First Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scenario** A: Closes its first set of accounts and commences business/ receives income in the year of incorporation | **First Set of Accounts** 15 Jul 2021 to 31 Dec 2021 | **Due Date to File First Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C** File for YA 2022 (basis period from 15 Jul 2021 to 31 Dec 2021) by 30 Nov 20221 |
| **Scenario** B: Closes its first set of accounts but does not commence business/ receive income in the year of incorporation | **First Set of Accounts** 15 Jul 2021 to 31 Dec 2021 | **Due Date to File First Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C** <br>No need to file for YA 2022 (basis period from 15 Jul 2021 to 31 Dec 2021)<br>File for YA 2023 (basis period from 1 Jan 2022 to 31 Dec 2022) by 30 Nov 2023 |
| **Scenario** C: Does not close its first set of accounts in the year of incorporation | **First Set of Accounts** 15 Jul 2021 to 31 Dec 20222 | **Due Date to File First Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C** <br>File for<br>1. YA 2022 (basis period from 15 Jul 2021 to 31 Dec 2021); and<br>2. YA 2023 (basis period from 1 Jan 2022 to 31 Dec 2022)<br>by 30 Nov 2023 |

2 As the company's first set of accounts covers a period of more than 12 months from the date of incorporation, its [profit/ losses must be attributed](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/basic-guide-to-corporate-income-tax-for-companies#attribution-of-profits--losses-for-new-companies) and declared under
2 YAs.

Time apportionment basis may be used if the company is not able to directly identify income and expenses to the 2 periods.

3 For all 3 scenarios, the company will receive its first Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C filing notification for YA 2023 by May 2023. There will be no notification for YA 2022.

[**Record Keeping Requirements**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/basic-guide-to-corporate-income-tax-for-companies#record-keeping-requirements)

To run a business, it is important to have good record keeping. Companies that adopt good record keeping practices are able to:

- Make better business decisions
- Be aware of the financial status of your company (e.g. profit or loss position, whether there is internal fraud or theft)
- Reduce the cost and effort required to file the Corporate Income Tax Returns, and to reply to IRAS’ queries (if any)

Your company must maintain proper records of its financial transactions and retain the source documents, accounting records and schedules, bank statements and any other records of transactions connected with your business for at least 5 years from the relevant Year of Assessment (YA).

The first YA of your company is the YA that relates to the [basis period](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/basic-guide-to-corporate-income-tax-for-companies#basis-period---year-of-assessment) during which your company is incorporated.

It depends on the financial year end chosen and the closing date of the first set of accounts. Hence, the first YA of your company may differ from another company that is incorporated on the same day.

#### Example 1: First Set of Accounts is 12 months

| Date of Incorporation | Financial Year End | First Set of Accounts Closed On | Period Covered in First Set of Accounts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Date of Incorporation** 1 Jul 2020 | **Financial Year End** 30 Jun every year | **First Set of Accounts Closed On** 30 Jun 2021 | **Period Covered in First Set of Accounts** 1 Jul 2020 to 30 Jun 2021 (12 months) |

| YA | Basis Period |
| --- | --- |
| **YA** First YA: 2022 | **Basis Period** 1 Jul 2020 to 30 Jun 2021 (12 months) |
| **YA** Second YA: 2023 | **Basis Period** 1 Jul 2021 to 30 Jun 2022 |
| **YA** Third YA: 2024 | **Basis Period** 1 Jul 2022 to 30 Jun 2023 |

#### Example 2: First Set of Accounts is less than 12 months

| Date of Incorporation | Financial Year End | First Set of Accounts Closed On | Period Covered in First Set of Accounts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Date of Incorporation** 1 Jul 2020 | **Financial Year End** 31 Dec every year | **First Set of Accounts Closed On** 31 Dec 2020 | **Period Covered in First Set of Accounts** 1 Jul 2020 to 31 Dec 2020 (Less than 12 months) |

| YA | Basis Period |
| --- | --- |
| **YA** First YA: 2021 | **Basis Period** 1 Jul 2020 to 31 Dec 2020 (Less than 12 months) |
| **YA** Second YA: 2022 | **Basis Period** 1 Jan 2021 to 31 Dec 2021 |
| **YA** Third YA: 2023 | **Basis Period** 1 Jan 2022 to 31 Dec 2022 |

#### Example 3: First Set of Accounts is more than 12 months

| Date of Incorporation | Financial Year End | First Set of Accounts Closed On | Period Covered in First Set of Accounts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Date of Incorporation** 1 Jul 2020 | **Financial Year End** 31 Dec every year | **First Set of Accounts Closed On** 31 Dec 2021 | **Period Covered in First Set of Accounts** 1 Jul 2020 to 31 Dec 2021 (More than 12 months) |

| YA | Basis Period |
| --- | --- |
| **YA** First YA: 2021 | **Basis Period** 1 Jul 2020 to 31 Dec 2020 (Less than 12 months) |
| **YA** Second YA: 2022 | **Basis Period** 1 Jan 2021 to 31 Dec 2021 |
| **YA** Third YA: 2023 | **Basis Period** 1 Jan 2022 to 31 Dec 2022 |

Note:

The company's [profit/ losses must be attributed](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/basic-guide-to-corporate-income-tax-for-companies#attribution-of-profits--losses-for-new-companies) and declared under 2 YAs (i.e. YAs 2021 and 2022) as the basis period for each YA should not exceed 12 months. Therefore, the first
YA is YA 2021, and not YA 2022.

Time apportionment may be used if the company is not able to directly identify its income and expenses to the 2 periods.

[**Attribution of Profits/ Losses for New Companies**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/basic-guide-to-corporate-income-tax-for-companies#attribution-of-profits--losses-for-new-companies)

Some new companies operate for more than 12 months before closing their first set of accounts. When this happens, the first set of accounts covers more than 12 months.

Generally, the basis period cannot exceed 12 months. The profits or losses must therefore be apportioned and attributed to 2 different Years of Assessment (YAs).

Your company should directly identify the income earned and expenses incurred for each of the 2 YAs, based on the actual dates the income was earned and the expenses were incurred. If this cannot be done, the time apportionment method can be used, where
the income earned and expenses incurred are apportioned based on the number of days in the corresponding YAs.

#### Example
