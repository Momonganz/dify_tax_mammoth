When registering for GST, you may be required to provide a guarantee.

On this page:

## When is a guarantee required

We adopt a risk-based approach in reviewing applications for registration and schemes. You may be requested to provide a guarantee when registering for GST or applying/ renewing GST schemes.

The guarantee is usually required to cover a period of 2 years for GST registrations.  In the case of GST schemes, the guarantee will cover the effective period of the GST schemes which may be from 3 to 5 years.

## Amount and form of guarantee

We will notify you on the amount of guarantee required upon processing your application for GST registration or GST schemes.

Digital guarantees (or eGuarantees) can be purchased from a number of [financial institutions](https://www.eguarantee.gov.sg/financial-institutions/#https://www.eguarantee.gov.sg/financial-institutions/ "financial-institutions"). Please visit [eGuarantee@Gov](http://www.eguarantee.gov.sg/ "eGuarantee") for more information on eGuarantees.
