[**Q1. How will assets in joint names be assessed for estate duty purposes?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/estate-duty/faqs#q1--how-will-assets-in-joint-names-be-assessed-for-estate-duty-purposes-)

The value of the asset subject to estate duty would generally depend on the contribution made by the deceased to acquire the asset.

If the deceased solely provided the funds, the full share will be assessed. If the other joint owner can show evidence that he or she also contributes equally towards the asset, then only half share of the value of the assets will be assessed.

[**Q2. A and B have savings, fixed deposits, and investment accounts and operate them as joint signatories. Should either one of them die, will estate duty be levied on full or half share of the funds in these accounts?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/estate-duty/faqs#q2--a-and-b-have-savings--fixed-deposits--and-investment-accounts-and-operate-them-as-joint-signatories--should-either-one-of-them-die--will-estate-duty-be-levied-on-full-or-half-share-of-the-funds-in-these-accounts-)

The amount subject to estate duty would generally depend on the contributions made by the deceased towards the accounts.

If the deceased solely provided the funds, the full balance will be taxed. If the other joint owner can show evidence that he or she also contributes equally towards the asset, then only half share of the value of the assets will be assessed.

## Insurance

[**Q7. How is estate duty taxed on insurance policies?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/estate-duty/faqs#q7--how-is-estate-duty-taxed-on-insurance-policies-)

1. If the policies were effected by the deceased on his own life, the insurance proceeds payable on his death is subject to estate duty.
2. If policies were effected by the deceased on the life of another person (e.g. where the children are the life assured), the cash/surrender value of the policy as at the date of death is subject to estate duty.

[**Q8. If the spouse and children of the deceased are the named beneficiaries and the insurance policy is on the life of the deceased, is the insurance payout subject to estate duty?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/estate-duty/faqs#q8--if-the-spouse-and-children-of-the-deceased-are-the-named-beneficiaries-and-the-insurance-policy-is-on-the-life-of-the-deceased--is-the-insurance-payout-subject-to-estate-duty-)

Such policies are subject to estate duty. However, if the deceased never had any interest in the policy, it will be assessed as a separate estate where an
[exemption](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/estate-duty/how-to-calculate-estate-duty "exemptions")

of $600,000 will be given.

[**Q9. HDB's Home Protection Scheme (HPS) is taken to cover the home mortgage. In the event of death, would the proceeds of the policy be subject to estate duty?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/estate-duty/faqs#q9--hdb-s-home-protection-scheme--hps--is-taken-to-cover-the-home-mortgage--in-the-event-of-death--would-the-proceeds-of-the-policy-be-subject-to-estate-duty-)

In the case of the HPS, the policy is assigned automatically to HDB, which means any insurance payout goes to the board directly to pay off the outstanding part of the loan. Hence, it would not attract estate duty.

[**Q10. If a mortgage insurance policy is taken for a private housing loan, is the payout subject to estate duty?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/estate-duty/faqs#q10--if-a-mortgage-insurance-policy-is-taken-for-a-private-housing-loan--is-the-payout-subject-to-estate-duty-)

If the policy has been assigned to the bank, i.e. the mortgagee that extends the loan, the insurer will liaise directly with the mortgagee to pay off the loan upon death.

Any balance of the insurance money, after offsetting the mortgage loan is subject to estate duty. If the policy has not been assigned, the insurance proceeds are subject to estate duty.

## Shares

[**Q11. How are shares valued?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/estate-duty/faqs#q11--how-are-shares-valued-)

### Public Listed Shares
