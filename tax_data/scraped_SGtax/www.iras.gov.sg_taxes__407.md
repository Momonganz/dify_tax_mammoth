The majority of GST-registered businesses pay GST on time. The payment of GST is due within 1 month after the end of the accounting period covered by the GST return. Your business will incur penalties and face recovery actions for late or non-payment of the GST.

On this page:

## Consequences for late payment or non-payment of taxes

IRAS may take the following actions if you fail to pay by the due date:

1. Impose late payment penalties
2. Appoint agents like your bank, employer, tenant or lawyer (handling the sale of any of your property) to recover the overdue tax
3. For sole proprietors or partners, IRAS can issue a Travel Restriction Order (TRO) to stop you from leaving Singapore
4. Take legal action

The above list is not exhaustive.

## Late payment penalty

A 5% late payment penalty will be imposed in the following circumstances:

1. On the estimated tax raised when the GST F5/F8 is not filed or filed late.
2. On the tax declared when the GST F5/F8 is filed on time, but payment is not made by the due date.
3. On any additional tax payable when the GST F7 is filed more than 1 year from the original due date of the GST F5/F8.
4. On any additional tax payable when the GST F7 is filed within 1 year from the original due date of the GST F5/F8, but payment for the additional tax declared is not made by the due date.

Business E filed a GST F5 Return for the period ending 30 Jun 2025 on 31 Jul 2025 but did not pay the GST liability of $10,000 declared. A late payment penalty notice was issued on 5 Aug 2025 and Business E eventually paid the GST and late penalties on
16 Dec 2025.

As the tax was unpaid 60 days from the late payment penalty notice, a 2% additional penalty was imposed for each month that the tax remained unpaid, starting from the date on which the tax became payable (i.e. 2% penalty was imposed for months of Aug, Sep, Oct and Nov 2025). The total penalty imposed was $1,300 (i.e. 5% penalty x $10,000 plus additional 2% penalties x $10,000 x 4 months).

Appeals can be made online via our [Appeal Penalty Waiver](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/iras/PenaltyWaiver) digital service at [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx).

3. Authorised appellant's Contact number
4. Authorised appellant's Email Address

Appeals will only be considered if:

1. You have submitted all the required GST returns and paid the overdue tax in full\*, by the due date as stated in the late payment penalty notice; and
2. No waiver has been granted in the past 2 calendar years up to date

\*Payment must be reflected in your tax account.

You can refer to [GST payments](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/payments?taxtype=Goods%20And%20Services%20Tax%20(GST)) for the various payment modes and processing times.

## Appointment of agents

If the GST remains unpaid, IRAS may appoint agents such as your bank, tenant, lawyer or other 3rd parties with money due to you to recover the outstanding taxes.

When your business’ bank is appointed as an agent, you will experience inconvenience in using your bank accounts (e.g. being unable to access your bank accounts) until you have fully paid the GST owed.

Requests for the release of your banks from the agent appointment made after 12pm on weekdays will only be processed on the next working day. Please note that requests cannot be processed on Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays.

Agents will be released from the appointment only after the tax and penalties have been paid in full.

## Travel restrictions

If you are a sole proprietor or a partner, a Travel Restriction Order (TRO) can be issued, and you cannot leave Singapore until you have paid the tax in full.

You can view and retrieve the Notification for Release of TRO via [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx) 2 working days after your payment has been received. This will facilitate your travel at the immigration checkpoints when departing Singapore. The notification will also be mailed to you within
10 days.

For non-NRIC holders, please note that it is your responsibility to ensure you have a valid pass to remain in Singapore. If you require more time to resolve your tax matters with IRAS, please contact the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to extend your stay. Overstaying in Singapore is an offence.

## Checking tax balance and making payment

To check your current balance, log in to [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx) and select "View Account Summary”. You can make GST payments
through various [payment modes](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-payments-refunds/how-to-pay). The payment will be processed within 3 working days.

### Difficulty paying your tax

If you [face difficulties with your tax payment](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-payments-refunds/experiencing-difficulties-in-paying-your-tax), you may apply for a longer payment plan via the [Apply/Manage GIRO Plan](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/portal/giro/apply/select-bank) digital service at [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx).

If your payment plan is approved, you must follow the payment plan schedule. Otherwise, the plan will be cancelled and actions will be taken to recover the tax.

### GIRO cancellation or termination

You are advised to maintain sufficient funds in your bank account. If your GIRO deduction fails due to insufficient funds or incorrect limits set, etc., IRAS will cancel your GIRO plan. The balance of the unpaid taxes will become due and payable immediately. You may incur a penalty if you do not settle the unpaid taxes promptly.

If you repeatedly default on your payment plan, IRAS may reject your subsequent requests for payment arrangements.

GST F5/F8 filed late

If your GST F5/F8 is not filed by the due date, a 5% late payment penalty will be imposed on the estimated tax raised, even if you are on GIRO payment. The penalty will subsequently be revised based on the actual GST declared once you file your GST F5/F8.

GST F5/F8 filed on time

Your GIRO application must be approved before the payment due date (i.e. 1 month after the end of the accounting period covered by the GST return) to avoid late payment penalties from being imposed.

The processing time required for GIRO arrangements to be set up are as follows:

- within the next working day for re-activation of GIRO via myTax Portal (for taxpayers with previous arrangement set up with IRAS)
- within 3 working days for new online applications via myTax Portal, internet banking and AXS stations
- within 3 weeks for new applications via hardcopy GIRO application forms

If you fail to make payment for your overdue tax, IRAS may appoint your banks, tenant, employer, etc. as an agent to recover the unpaid tax.

Your appointed agent(s) will be required to pay moneys due to you to the Comptroller to settle your tax liabilities. The appointment will be released when the overdue tax is settled in full.
