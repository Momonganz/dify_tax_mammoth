Most taxpayers should receive their tax bills (Notice of Assessment) for the Year of Assessment 2024 from end Apr 2024 onwards. As IRAS sends out tax bills (digital or paper format) in batches, some taxpayers may receive them earlier than others.

If you have updated your mobile number/email address with IRAS, you will receive an SMS/email notification once your tax bill is finalised and ready for viewing online.

Please check your tax bill when you receive it. If you disagree with the tax assessment, please file an amendment within 30 days from the date of the tax bill. Find out [how to make changes to your tax assessment](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/understanding-my-income-tax-filing/making-changes-after-filing-receiving-tax-bill "making changes after receiving tax bill").

For previous years’ tax bills, visit [myTax Portal](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/login/selection "myTax Portal") to view or print a copy. Alternatively, you
may visit Revenue House in person to obtain them. Please note that search fees and document fees will apply.
