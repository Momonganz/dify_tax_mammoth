## Accounting Software That Supports Form C-S Filing

Companies may adopt #SeamlessFilingFromSoftware (#SFFS) to automate the preparation and filing of Form C-S to IRAS via accounting software. The entire filing process including Corppass authentication is linked to IRAS’ systems via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which acts as intermediaries that allow 2 applications to talk to each other. This simplifies the tax filing process for companies and reduces their risk of making errors.

**One-time Data Mapping**

Companies must perform a one-time mapping of the chart of accounts to a set of prescribed data elements (PDEs) in the accounting software. Instruction manuals and assistance will be provided by the Accounting Software Providers. Alternatively, companies
may use the default data mapping which is available in some of the listed accounting software. The default data mapping is especially useful for newly-incorporated companies or companies new to using the accounting software. Companies can contact
the accounting software providers to find out more.

**Review and File Form C-S**

Personnel who is authorised by the company to file its Form C-S can begin filing using the accounting software. The personnel should be granted the Corppass-Approver role for Corporate Income Tax filing purpose.

The accounting software will generate the following draft documents for review:

- Form C-S
- Profit & Loss Statement
- Tax Computation & Supporting Schedules

After review, the filer makes a declaration and files only the Form C-S to IRAS. An acknowledgement will be provided and displayed in the accounting software upon submission. Copies of the Profit & Loss Statement and Tax Computation & Supporting
Schedules will be saved in the accounting software. They should be provided to IRAS only upon request. The deadline for filing the Form C-S via the accounting software is 30 Nov each year (e.g. YA 20X1 Form C-S has to be filed by 30 Nov 20X1). For YA 2023 to YA 2025, IRAS will automatically extend the CIT filing due date by 15 days (i.e. from 30 Nov to 15 Dec) for Form C-S returns filed through accounting software. Businesses filing YA 2023 to YA 2025 Form C-S returns through #SFFS do not need to separately request for the extension.
