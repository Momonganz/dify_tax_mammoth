Contract manufacturers and traders under this scheme are relieved of the need to account for GST on value added activities supplied to non-GST registered overseas customers or overseas persons who are registered under the Overseas Vendor Registration (OVR) regime as a pay-only person.

On this page:

## Purpose

The ACMT Scheme is a scheme designed to relieve businesses (e.g. local contract manufacturers) that have substantial business with overseas clients\* of the need to account for GST on value added activities performed on the goods of such
clients.

\*An overseas client refers to an overseas customer who is not GST-registered or if he is GST-registered, the registration is as a pay-only person under the OVR regime.

## Eligibility

The scheme is currently available to contract manufacturers within the

1. Semi-conductor industry;
2. Printing industry; and
3. Biomedical industry - Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) manufacturing.

Contract manufacturers in other business segments in the biomedical industry will be considered for the ACMT scheme on a case-by-case basis.

## Benefits of ACMT Scheme

### 1\. Disregarding the supply of value-added activities

You are able to disregard the supply of value added activities (e.g. processing, assembly and testing services) to your overseas client when the goods you have treated/ processed are:

1. Exported;

2. Delivered to another ACMT person (i.e. ACMT CM or LOG); or

3. Delivered to the final customer of the overseas client.


You are also able to disregard the supply of value added service relating to failed or excess productions to your overseas client if the goods you have treated/ processed are:

1. Exported; or
2. Delivered locally to a waste management vendor for disposal or destruction **at no consideration**.

### Self-disposal

When you self-destroy or self-dispose the failed or excess productions instead, you should write in to seek the Comptroller's confirmation that you can disregard your supply of value added service relating to those goods.

Please provide details of the destruction/ disposal process and supporting documentation that you will maintain.

No GST is chargeable on the fees charged to your overseas client.

### 2\. Enjoying import GST suspension

You can enjoy import GST suspension for the following scenarios:

1. Importation of your own goods in the course or furtherance of your business;
2. Importation of goods belonging to your overseas principal for supply either in Singapore or for export, as a [section 33(2) agent](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/importing-of-goods#title9)\*.
    The overseas principal must not be GST-registered or if he is GST-registered, the registration is as a pay-only person under the OVR regime;
3. Importation of goods belonging to your overseas principal which will subsequently be re-exported, as a [section 33A agent](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/importing-of-goods#title9)\*.
    The overseas principal must not be GST-registered or if he is GST-registered, the registration is as a pay-only person under the OVR regime;




\*For more information on sections 33(2) and 33A agents, please refer to [GST: Guide on Imports](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide_gst_guide-on-imports.pdf?sfvrsn=3208f1ab_72)  (PDF, 423KB).

4. Importation of goods (for example, raw materials) consigned to you by your overseas client on which value-added activities are performed under ACMT scheme; and
5. Re-importation of goods which you previously sent abroad for value-added activities, belonging to your local customer or GST-registered overseas customer (excluding a person who is registered under the OVR regime as a pay-only person) if
    the requirements under section 33B explained in [GST: Claiming of GST on re-import of value-added goods](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etax-guide_claiming-of-gst-on-re-import-of-value-added-goods_third-edition.pdf?sfvrsn=a52d4f62_14)
    (PDF, 565KB) are satisfied.


### 3\. Claiming GST on local purchases

You can claim the GST incurred on goods (for example, raw materials) locally purchased by your overseas client and delivered to you on which you perform value-added service, on behalf of the overseas client as if it is your own input tax.

The goods should become inputs to your treated or processed goods which are subsequently:

1. Exported; or
2. Delivered to another ACMT person or a customer of your overseas client.

You can only make the above input tax claim if you have either:

1. Paid the GST on the goods yourself; or
2. Refunded the GST to your overseas client who has paid the GST first.
