experience.


SCTP is a tax accreditation body jointly established by the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore and the Tax Academy of Singapore. An Accredited Tax Advisor or Accredited Tax Practitioner with the SCTP would have the expertise and
experience to assist businesses to better manage their tax affairs.
