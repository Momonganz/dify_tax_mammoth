## How CPF Data Link-up Service works

IRAS will obtain employees' data for the period **Jan to Dec 2024** if:

- the data has been e-Submitted\* to CPF Board by **14 Jan 2025** (or the next working day if the 14th falls on a Saturday, Sunday or Public Holiday); and
- the CPF Submission No. (CSN) is **'PTE' account type**.

Reduce data entry effort by having more details prefilled from CPF Board, use  [CPF EzPay (via Employee Database)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/data-obtained-from-cpf-board-under-the-cpf-data-link-up-service.pdf?sfvrsn=90129335_15 "data obtained from cpf board under the cpf data link up service") (PDF, 390KB) when submitting your employees' monthly CPF contributions to CPF Board.

\*Note:

- If you use a different CPF Submission Number (CSN) with the same UEN (e.g., 12345678A-PTE-01 and 12345678A-PTE-02, etc.) to submit your employees' monthly CPF contributions, all the employees' information under the respective CSNs
will be combined and pre-filled in 'Submit Employment Income Records' digital service under the same UEN.
- For each employee, the monthly data will be summed up for the whole year and displayed in the digital service by **1 Feb 2025**.
