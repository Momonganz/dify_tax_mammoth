GST-registered businesses will be imposed with a composition amount or face recovery actions for any late or non-filing of their GST returns. GST filing and payment are due 1 month after the end of the accounting period covered by the return.

On this page:

## Consequences for late or non-filing of tax returns

Failure to file your GST returns by the due date is an offence.

IRAS may take the following recovery actions if you fail to file by the due date:

1. Issue an estimated Notice of Assessment and impose a 5% late payment penalty on the estimated tax
2. Impose a late submission penalty
3. Issue a Notice to Attend Court/ Summons to the business or persons responsible for running of the business (including the sole-proprietor, partner and director)

If you are a GST-registered business that has no business activity during the accounting period, you must still file a 'Nil' GST return. If your business has ceased, please apply for [cancellation of GST registration](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-registration-deregistration/cancelling-gst-registration).

## Estimated Notice of Assessment

IRAS will issue an estimated Notice of Assessment based on any information that IRAS may have. A 5% late payment penalty will be imposed on the estimated tax.

If your business receives an estimated Notice of Assessment, you must:

1. **File your GST return immediately**
The estimated tax and penalty will be revised once you declare your actual GST liability. Refer to the guide on [how to revise the estimated assessment](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-payments-refunds/revising-estimated-assessment).

2. **Pay the GST inclusive of 5% late payment penalty before the due date stated on the late payment penalty notice**

[Recovery actions](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-payments-refunds/late-payment-or-non-payment-of-gst) will be taken on any overdue amount if you fail
to pay your GST.

The estimated GST payable can only be revised if the GST F5/F8 is submitted within 5 years from the end of the relevant accounting period.

## Late submission penalty

A late submission penalty of $200 is imposed immediately when the GST return is not filed by the due date.

A further penalty of $200 is imposed for every completed month that the GST F5/F8 return remains outstanding. The maximum penalty amount for each outstanding F5/F8 return is $10,000. You must pay the late submission penalty alongside any GST payments due.

### Paying the late submission penalty

If you make payment for GST via GIRO, the late submission penalty will be deducted via GIRO on the 15th of the month after the due date indicated in the penalty notice.

Businesses under non-GIRO payment modes can make payment via one of the preferred [payment modes](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-payments-refunds/how-to-pay).

The payment will be processed within 3 working days. To check if your payment has been credited, log in to [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx) and select "View Account Summary".

Legal actions may still be taken against your business if you do not file the outstanding tax return after paying the late submission penalty.

### Appealing for waiver of late submission penalty

Appeals can be made online via our [Appeal Penalty Waiver](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/iras/PenaltyWaiver) digital service at [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx).

To complete the appeal for waiver of penalty request online, you will need the following information:

1. Accounting period ending (For example, for the period 1 Jan 2025 – 31 Mar 2025, please indicate “Mar 2025”.)
2. Authorised appellant's Designation
3. Authorised appellant's Contact number
4. Authorised appellant's Email Address


Appeals will only be considered if:

1. You have submitted the outstanding GST returns; and
2. You have paid all the overdue GST\*; and
3. You have filed your GST returns on time for the past 2 years.

\*Payment must be reflected in your tax account. You can refer to [GST payments](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/payments?taxtype=Goods%20And%20Services%20Tax%20(GST)) for the various payment modes and processing times.

## Notice to Attend Court/ Summons

If you repeatedly fail to file your GST returns, a Notice to Attend Court/ Summons may be issued to your business and/or persons responsible for running of the business.

The notice will specify a court date. To avoid attending court, you must complete all of the following actions at least one week before the specified date:

1. File the outstanding GST returns
2. Pay the composition amount (quoting the payment slip number) using the preferred [payment modes](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-payments-refunds/how-to-pay). GIRO payment is not allowed.


### Postponement of Court hearing

If you need more time to file and/or pay the composition amount, you must attend Court on the specified date indicated in the Notice to Attend Court/ Summons with a Letter of Authorisation to appeal for postponement.

### Attending Court

Failure to attend Court will result in further legal actions taken against your business, potentially including the issuance of a warrant of arrest against the sole-proprietor, partner or company director.

Should your business be convicted of the offence in Court, your business may face a fine of up to $5,000 for each offence.

You are still required to file the outstanding tax returns. Otherwise, further legal actions may be taken.
