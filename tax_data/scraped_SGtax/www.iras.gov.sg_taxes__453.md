## Basis of Objection

You can object to the Annual Value (AV) and/ or its effective date. You should not be objecting to the [property tax rates](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/property-tax/property-owners/property-tax-rates "Property Tax Rates and Sample Calculations") as they are fixed according to the occupancy status of the property (owner-occupied or non-owner-occupied).

## Filing an Objection

To file an objection, you can use our ['Object to Annual Value'](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/portal/property/object-to-annual-value) digital service.

In your objection, you need to state your desired AV, effective date and the grounds of your objection, including any evidence to support your desired AV.

The following are not valid grounds for objections:

1. Tax rates are too high.

3. Financial hardship.
