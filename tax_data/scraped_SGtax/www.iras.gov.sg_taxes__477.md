When debts cannot be recovered, you may apply for bad debt relief to recover GST charged but unpaid by your customers. Should your customer subsequently pay you, you must repay the relief claimed.

## Bad debts

A bad debt situation occurs when money that is owed cannot be recovered. You can **apply for bad debt relief** from the Comptroller of GST for return of the output tax previously accounted for and paid by you.

On the other hand, if you as a customer have not paid your supplier within 12 months from the due date of payment, you are required to repay to the Comptroller the input tax that you have previously claimed (if any). For more details, please refer to

### Stating amount repayable in GST return

The amount repayable should be included in **Box 6(output tax due)** of your GST return using the tax fraction for the prescribed accounting period in which the payment is received.

[**Example 2: Repaying IRAS after recovering bad debt**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/charging-gst-(output-tax)/common-scenarios---do-i-charge-gst/bad-debt-relief#example-2--repaying-iras-after-recovering-bad-debt)

You sold a batch of goods worth $10,000 to Customer B and accounted for output tax of $800 on 31 Mar 2023 based on the prevailing GST rate.

Subsequently, Customer B defaults payment and you claim back the output tax from IRAS as Bad Debt Relief.

A few months later, Customer BÂ  pays you $8,000. You are required to repay IRAS part of your claim for Bad Debt Relief using the tax fraction as follows:

Amount to be repaid to IRAS = $8,000 \* 8/108 = $592.59
