Overview of the tax reliefs and rebates available for married couples and families.

On this page:

Tax reliefs and rebates are allowable if:

1. You are a Singapore tax resident; and
2. You meet the qualifying conditions in the year preceding the Year of Assessment (YA).

For example, if your child was born in 2023, child-related reliefs and rebates in respect of him/her will be considered with effect from YA 2024. Please note that a [personal income tax relief cap](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/tax-reliefs-rebates-and-deductions/tax-reliefs#title1 "personal income tax relief cap") of $80,000 applies to the total amount of all tax reliefs claimed for each YA.
