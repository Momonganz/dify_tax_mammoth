## FAQs

[**I am a local publisher of a magazine (hardcopy) which is circulated in Singapore and overseas. A customer places an advertisement in an issue of the magazine. Do I need to charge GST on my provision of advertising space to my customer?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/specific-business-sectors/advertising#i-am-a-local-publisher-of-a-magazine--hardcopy--which-is-circulated-in-singapore-and-overseas--a-customer-places-an-advertisement-in-an-issue-of-the-magazine--do-i-need-to-charge-gst-on-my-provision-of-advertising-space-to-my-customer-)

With effect from 1 Jan 2022, the GST treatment for supplies of media sales (including the supply of advertising space in your magazine) will depend on the belonging status of the customer (i.e. contractual
party) and the direct beneficiary.

If you contract with an overseas customer and your supply directly benefits either an overseas person or a GST-registered person in Singapore, your supply of advertising space to the overseas customer can be zero-rated.

Conversely, if you contract with a local customer, the entire supply of advertising space must be standard-rated.

Prior to 1 Jan 2022, the GST treatment of your supply of advertising space in your magazine will depend on the place of circulation of the magazine, **regardless whether the customer belongs in Singapore or overseas**:

- If at least 51% of the total circulation is outside Singapore, you can zero-rate the entire supply of advertising space to your customer under section 21(3)(u) of the GST Act.
- If less than 51% of the circulation is outside Singapore, you must standard-rate the entire value of supply of advertising space to your customer.
- The 51% rule of circulation applies only to magazine of the same language, version and edition for distribution to multiple countries. It is determined based on expected volume of the circulation in each country or average actual circulation if there
is an established track record.
