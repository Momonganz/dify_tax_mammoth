The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) was enacted by the US to target non-compliance with US tax laws by US persons using non-US accounts. FATCA requires Financial Institutions (FI) outside the US to report on the assets held by their US account
holders or be subject to withholding tax on certain payments. Singapore has entered into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the US to facilitate the FATCA obligations of FIs in Singapore, and has been reporting financial account information to the US since 2015.

If you are a Reporting Singapore Financial Institution (SGFI), you will have to register for FATCA with IRAS. You are required to conduct due diligence on all US Financial Accounts you maintain and report the relevant account information in a timely and
accurate manner to IRAS in an annual return.

If you are an individual holding an account with a Reporting SGFI, you may be affected by FATCA in several ways. You may refer to the [Basic information for account holders of Financial Institutions](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/international-tax/foreign-account-tax-compliance-act-(fatca)/basic-information-for-account-holders-of-financial-institutions) for more information.

## FATCA Overview

FATCA was enacted by the US in March 2010 to target non-compliance with US tax laws by US persons using accounts outside the US. FATCA requires all FIs outside the US to report, on a regular basis, information about Financial Accounts held by US persons
to the US IRS. FIs that fail to comply will face a 30% FATCA-related withholding tax on certain payments made from the US to them.

Singapore entered into a Model 1 IGA with the US to facilitate the discharge of SGFIs’ obligations arising under FATCA. Under the Agreement, instead of having to report financial account information of US persons directly with the US, reporting
SGFIs will benefit from simplified compliance procedures and will instead report such account information to IRAS. IRAS will subsequently provide the reported information to the US Internal Revenue Service (“US IRS”).

In Singapore, the FATCA Regulations in the Income Tax Act requires and empowers all reporting SGFIs to put in place necessary processes and systems to collect such financial account information from their US account holders to IRAS.
