In Singapore, the tax residency of a company is determined by the place where the business is controlled and managed. If the control and management of the company is not exercised in Singapore, the company is considered a non-resident for tax purposes.

It is important to note that the place of incorporation does not necessarily determine the tax residency of a company.
