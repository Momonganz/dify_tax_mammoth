The cash top-ups made to an employee's CPF Retirement Account/ Special Account/ MediSave Account on his/ her behalf, are considered the employee's taxable income which the employee contributed into his/ her CPF Retirement Account/ Special Account/ MediSave
Account. The employee can, subject to conditions, enjoy [CPF cash top-up relief](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/employees/deductions-for-individuals/personal-reliefs-and-tax-rebates/cpf-cash-top-up-relief).

[**Withholding Tax on Interest Payments Borne by Companies on Behalf of Non-Residents**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/business-expenses/tax-treatment-of-business-expenses-(s-z)#withholding-tax-on-interest-payments-borne-by-companies-on-behalf-of-non-residents)

Generally, your company ('payer') is required to withhold tax on interest paid to a non-resident, unless tax exemption or waiver of withholding tax obligation is granted. In some cases, the withholding tax on the interest may be borne by the payer on
behalf of a non-resident.

Where the loan agreement provides that the lender receives the gross amount of interest (without any deduction of withholding tax), the withholding tax borne is treated as part of the interest paid. The interest expense is tax-deductible if the loan is
taken up to finance income producing assets.

The payer may be required, upon request by the Comptroller of Income Tax, to provide documents to substantiate that the lender is to receive the gross amount of interest.

Where the loan agreement does not provide that the lender receives the gross amount of interest (without any deduction of withholding tax), the withholding tax borne by the payer is not treated as part of the interest paid. It is also not a prescribed
borrowing cost that is specifically deductible under the Income Tax Act 1947. Whether the withholding tax borne on behalf of the non-resident is tax-deductible depends on the purpose of the loan:

- If the loan is taken up for revenue purposes (e.g. to finance the purchase of trading stock), the withholding tax expense is deductible in the hands of the payer as it is a revenue expense.
- If the loan is taken up for capital purpose (e.g. to finance capital assets), the payer is not able to claim a tax deduction on the withholding tax expense.

The payer may be required, upon request by the Comptroller of Income Tax, to provide documents to substantiate the purpose of the loan.
