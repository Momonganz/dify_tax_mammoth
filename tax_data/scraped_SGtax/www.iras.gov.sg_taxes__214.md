Stamp Duty is charged on the document signed when you buy or acquire shares. The duty is payable on the actual price or value of the shares, whichever is higher.

On this page:

## Manner of acquisitions

Examples of shares acquisition in which stamp duty is payable:

1. By way of purchase e.g. share transfer instruments
2. By way of gift including a voluntary declaration of trust and settlement




Declaration of Trust / Trust Deed

A fixed duty of $10 is payable on the Declaration of Trust / Trust Deed which does not result in a change in beneficial interest in the shares.




Where there is a change in beneficial interest in the shares, full stamp duty will be payable on the Declaration of Trust / Trust Deed.

3. By way of distribution as a dividend in specie by a company
4. By way of distribution in specie upon the winding up of a company
5. By way of distribution from the estate of a deceased that is not in accordance to Will, Intestate Succession Act or Muslim Law of Inheritance

## Determining value of shares

### 1\. Shares listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore

The value of the shares transferred is taken to be the average price on the Stock Exchange of Singapore as at the date of the document.

When there is no available average price as at the date of the document, the latest average price of the shares can be used.

### 2\. Shares in private companies

The value of the shares transferred is taken to be the net asset value (NAV) or the allotment price of the shares being transferred in the target company. Please refer to Example 1 on how to compute the NAV per share and the NAV of the total shares transferred.

Where there are different classes of shares (e.g.: preference shares in the target company), the NAV per share will depend on the rights attached to the respective class of share. Please refer to Example 2 on how to compute the NAV per share for each type of share and the NAV of the total shares transferred.

**a.     Where the company has been incorporated for more than 18 months**

For Stamp Duty purposes, the value of the shares transferred is the NAV of the total shares transferred in the target company. The NAV is computed based on the latest statement of accounts of the target company which should be dated within 24 months before the date of transfer.

Where the target company owns any property (including a leasehold property if it is recorded as a non-current asset in the company's financial accounts), the market value of the property as at the date of document should be used in place of the book value if the book value is not reflective of the market value.

**b.    Where the company has been incorporated for 18 months or less**

For Stamp Duty purposes, the value of the shares transferred is the total allotment price of the shares being transferred if the target company does not own any property.

Where the target company owns any property (including a leasehold property if it is recorded as a non-current asset in the company's financial accounts), the management accounts have to be prepared to determine the NAV of the shares transferred.

The statement of accounts or management accounts should:

a. Reflect the market value of the property as at the date of document for the share transfer

b. Be certified by the director or secretary of the company

## Rates and computation

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Stamp Duty for transfer of shares** | 0.2% of the purchase price or the value of the shares transferred |

Stamp duty is rounded down to the nearest dollar, subject to a minimum duty of $1.

### A. Target company owns only ordinary shares

[**Example: Transfer of shares in target company that owns only ordinary shares**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/stamp-duty/for-shares/buying-or-acquiring-shares#example--transfer-of-shares-in-target-company-that-owns-only-ordinary-shares)

Total assets : $850,000

Total liabilities: $300,000

Share capital : 100,000 ordinary shares of $1 each fully paid

Number of shares transferred : 5,000 ordinary shares

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Total Net Asset Value (NAV) | Total assets - Total liabilities<br>= $850,000 - $300,000<br>= $550,000 |
| NAV per share | $550,000 / 100,000<br>= $5.50 |
| Stamp Duty | 0.2% x NAV for the total share transferred<br>= 0.2% x ($5.50 x 5,000)<br>= 0.2% x $27,500<br>**= $55** |

### B. Target company owns ordinary shares and preference shares
