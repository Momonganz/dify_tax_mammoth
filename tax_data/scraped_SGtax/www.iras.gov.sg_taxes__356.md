All income earned in Singapore is subject to tax. You must declare all sources of income you have earned in your Income Tax Return.

On this page:

## Income earned in Singapore is taxable

All income earned in Singapore is taxable.

The amount of income tax you need to pay depends on:

1. **how much you earn in Singapore**; and
2. whether you are a **tax resident** or **non-resident** for income tax purposes.



Your income tax is calculated on a preceding year basis. The Year of Assessment refers to the income earned in the previous year. For example, Year of Assessment 2024, refers to income earned from 1 Jan 2023 to 31 Dec 2023.

## Tax residents

You are a tax resident for a particular Year of Assessment if you are a:

1. Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR) who normally resides in Singapore except for temporary absences; or

2. Foreigner who has stayed/worked in Singapore:
1. for at least 183 days in the previous calendar year; or
2. continuously for 3 consecutive years; or
3. Foreigner who has worked in Singapore for a continuous period straddling 2 calendar years and your total period of stay\* is at least 183 days. This applies to foreign employees who entered Singapore but excludes [directors of a company](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/payments-to-non-resident-director/board-director), [public entertainers](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/payments-to-non-resident-public-entertainer-(artiste-musician-sportsman-etc-)/non-resident-public-entertainer) or [professionals](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/payments-to-non-resident-professional-(consultant-trainer-coach-etc-)/non-resident-professional).




\\* including your physical presence immediately before and after your employment.


Foreigners issued with a work pass that is valid for at least 1 year will also be treated as a tax resident. However, your tax residency status will be reviewed at the point of [tax clearance](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/employers/tax-clearance-for-foreign-spr-employees-(ir21) "tax clearance") when you cease your employment based on the tax residency rules. If your stay in Singapore is less than 183 days, you
will be regarded as a non-resident.

Tax residents may use this [tax calculator](https://www.iras.gov.sg/docs/default-source/individual-income-tax/employees/tax-calculator_residents_ya24.xls?sfvrsn=2d0568c6_12 "tax calculator") (XLS, 112KB) to estimate the tax payable.

[**For foreigners: Number of days of employment**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/tax-residency-and-tax-rates/working-out-my-tax-residency#for-foreigners--number-of-days-of-employment)

The number of days of employment in Singapore includes weekends and public holidays. Any absences from Singapore that are temporary (e.g. overseas vacation leave) or incidental to your employment (e.g. business trips) are still counted in the total days of employment for the purpose of determining your tax residency status.

## Tax treatment of tax residents

As a tax resident:

1. You will be taxed on all income earned in Singapore;
2. Your foreign-sourced income (with the exception of those received through partnerships in Singapore) brought into Singapore is tax-exempt;
3. You may claim deductions on expenses, donations and personal reliefs. Find out more about [deductions to save tax](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/tax-reliefs-rebates-and-deductions).


The income of tax residents after deducting allowable expenses, donations and personal reliefs is subject to income tax at [progressive rates](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/tax-residency-and-tax-rates/individual-income-tax-rates) ranging
from 0% to 24%.
