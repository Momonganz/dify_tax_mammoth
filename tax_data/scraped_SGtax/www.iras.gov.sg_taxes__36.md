[**1\. Cash donations for local causes**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/charities/donations-tax-deductions#1--cash-donations-for-local-causes)

Cash donations made to an approved Institution of a Public Character (IPC) for causes that benefit the local community, or the Singapore Government are tax deductible donations.

This donation scheme applies to both **corporate and individual donors**.

Not all registered charities are approved IPCs. Donations made to a charity without approved IPC status are not tax deductible.

Learn if an organisation is an approved IPC at the [Charity Portal.](https://www.charities.gov.sg/ "Charity Portal")

### Cash donations with benefits

Only outright cash donations to approved IPC that do not give material benefit to the donor are fully tax deductible.

If a donor receives a benefit in return for the donation made, tax deduction is granted only on the difference between the donation and the value of
benefit.

However if the benefits are treated as having no commercial value and the donation is made to IPCs on or after 1 May 2006, it will be deemed as pure donations although there are benefits given in return for the donation.

#### What is a benefit with no commercial value

Before 19 Mar 2021

Benefits are treated as having no commercial value if:

1. The benefit is given in acknowledgement of the donation; and
2. The benefit has no resale value.

### When will contributions not be considered donations

A contribution will not qualify as a tax deductible donation if the contribution is governed by an agreement which includes any of the following attributes:

1. The contribution agreement contains a refund clause, where the recipient is obliged to refund (wholly or in part) the contribution or make other compensation arrangements to the contributor; or
2. The contribution agreement contains an ‘exclusivity’ clause which prevents the recipient from accepting funds/contributions from and/or acknowledging other contributors/donors, regardless of whether the latter are from the same industry
    as the contributor; or
3. The contribution arrangement is in substance a commercial arrangement or an exchange of monies for benefits. Such arrangements include outright sales of goods or services, instances where the contributor derives substantial commercial benefits from
    the contribution arrangement, or instances where the contributor retains contractual rights over the sum contributed.

View details on what contributions are considered donations and eligible for tax deduction in " [Guidance on Tax Deductible Donations](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/guidance-on-tax-deductible-donations_2023-03-02.pdf?sfvrsn=d038d29d_9)" (PDF, 295KB).

## How much tax deduction can you get

[**Calculating tax deduction**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/charities/donations-tax-deductions#calculating-tax-deduction)

The tax deduction on donation is deducted against your statutory income (which includes your employment, trade income, etc.) before arriving at your assessable income.

| Computation |
| **Total statutory income** |
| Less: Donations |
| **=Assessable income** |
| Less: Personal reliefs |
| **=Chargeable income** |

**Example: Donation of $10,000 to an approved IPC for causes that benefit the local community**

If your total statutory income for YA 2024 is $100,000 (i.e. you earned $100,000 in 2023) and you donated $10,000 to an IPC in 2023, your assessable income would be calculated as follows:

| Total Statutory Income | Amount of Donation | Amount of Deductible Donations | Assessable Income for YA 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Total Statutory Income** $100,000 | **Amount of Donation** $10,000 | **Amount of Deductible Donations** $25,000 ($10,000 x 2.5) | **Assessable Income for YA 2024** = $75,000 ($100,000 - $25,000) |

## How to claim tax deductible donations

Tax deduction is given for donations made in the preceding year. For example, if an individual makes a donation in 2023, tax deduction will be allowed in his tax assessment for the Year of Assessment (YA) 2024.

You do not need to declare the donation amount in your income tax return. Tax deductions for qualifying donations are automatically reflected in your tax assessments based on the information from the IPC (such as the donor's name, date
and amount of donation on the tax deduction receipt).

IRAS does not accept claims for tax deduction based on donation receipts.

From 1 Jan 2011, individuals and businesses are required to provide their identification number (e.g. NRIC/FIN/UEN) when making donations to the IPCs if they wish to receive tax deductions on the donations made.

### Donation receipts

When donations are tax deductible, the donation receipts issued by approved IPCs will indicate the words "Tax Deductible".

Expand all

[**Donations made by individuals to IPCs via payroll**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/charities/donations-tax-deductions#donations-made-by-individuals-to-ipcs-via-payroll)

The donation is included automatically in your tax assessment if:

1. Your employer is under the Auto-inclusion Scheme for Employment Income; and
2. You have arranged for donations to be deducted from payroll.

If your employer is not under the Auto-inclusion Scheme for Employment Income, you may make donation claims for donations made via payroll in your own income tax return.

[**Donations made by corporations & bodies of persons**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/charities/donations-tax-deductions#donations-made-by-corporations---bodies-of-persons)

All companies or [bodies of persons](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/bodiesofpersons/overview_bodiesofpersons) must provide their names and tax reference number to the IPCs if they wish to claim tax deductions on their donations.

[**Donations made by individuals to IPCs via GIRO**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/charities/donations-tax-deductions#donations-made-by-individuals-to-ipcs-via-giro)

The donation is included automatically in your tax assessment if:

1. You have arranged for the donations to be deducted from GIRO; and
2. You have given your NRIC or FIN No. to the IPC at the point of donation.

[**Anonymous donors**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/charities/donations-tax-deductions#anonymous-donors)

Donors who wish to remain anonymous and do not wish to claim tax deduction are not required to provide their tax reference numbers to the IPCs.

However, if donors subsequently wish to claim tax deduction, they should provide their tax reference numbers
to the IPCs. The IPCs would then resubmit the information to IRAS.

## Carrying forward of unutilised tax deduction for donations to IPCs

When the tax deduction for the donation is **more than** the income for the year, the qualifying donor (i.e. individuals, companies, trusts, bodies of persons) may carry forward the unutilised deductions for a maximum of 5 years. This is not applicable for donations for overseas causes.

For example, a donation made in 2023 and allowed tax deduction in YA 2024 can be carried forward (if tax deduction for donation exceeds the income for 2023) up to YA 2029.

Corporate donors must satisfy the [shareholding test](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/unutilised-items-(capital-allowances-trade-losses-donations) "shareholding test") if they want to deduct the unutilised tax deduction for donations against their future income (similar to that
imposed for claim of carry forward of trade losses and unutilised capital allowances). Unutilised donations will rank for deduction after trade losses and capital allowances.

## Remission from stamp duties

[**Stamp duty**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/charities/donations-tax-deductions#stamp-duty)

All donations of [immoveable properties](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/stamp-duty/for-property) and
[shares](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/stamp-duty/for-shares) to approved IPCs made on or after 1 Mar 2003 will enjoy remission from stamp duty.
