## What is Deductible

Deductible business expenses reduce your company’s taxable income and the amount of tax you need to pay.

### Example

| Computation | $ |
| --- | --- |
| **Computation** Income | **$** 80,000 |
| **Computation** Business Expenses | **$** 15,000 |
| **Computation** \- Deductible Business Expenses | **$** 5,000 |
| **Computation** \- Non-Deductible Business Expenses | **$** 10,000 |
| **Computation** **Income Subject to Tax ('Taxable Income')** | **$** **80,000 - 5,000 = 75,000**<br>**(Income minus deductible expenses)** |

Generally, deductible business expenses are those **'wholly and exclusively incurred in the production of income'**. In other words, they **must satisfy all these conditions**:

- The expenses are solely incurred in the production of income.
- The expenses must be incurred. It is considered incurred when the legal liability to pay arises, regardless of whether the actual payment has been made.
- The expenses are revenue in nature, and not capital expenses. Revenue expenses are generally costs incurred in the day-to-day operations of a business to generate revenue (such as salaries, rent, and utilities), while capital expenses are investments in the business that are expected to provide long-term benefits (such as acquisition of fixed assets).
- The expenses are not prohibited from deduction under the Income Tax Act 1947.
