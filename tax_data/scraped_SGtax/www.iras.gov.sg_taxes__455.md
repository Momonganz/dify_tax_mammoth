[**What if I lose some of my records?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/basics-of-gst/invoicing-price-display-and-record-keeping/keeping-records#what-if-i-lose-some-of-my-records-)

If you are unable to provide sufficient documents to support your input tax claim, your input tax claim will be disallowed.

If you lose the supporting documents to prove the export of your goods or provision of international services, you will have to treat your sale as a local supply and account for the 9% GST accordingly.

In addition, penalties may be imposed for failure to maintain sufficient documents to support your GST declaration.

[**If my business purchases a new accounting software, do we need to migrate all the accounting transactions recorded in the existing accounting software to the new accounting software?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/basics-of-gst/invoicing-price-display-and-record-keeping/keeping-records#if-my-business-purchases-a-new-accounting-software--do-we-need-to-migrate-all-the-accounting-transactions-recorded-in-the-existing-accounting-software-to-the-new-accounting-software-)

You do not need to migrate the accounting transactions recorded in the existing accounting software to the new accounting software.

However, you must retain accounting transactions recorded in the existing software for at least 5 years from the YA or end of the GST accounting period, and be able to retrieve them if requested by IRAS. Business documents associated with these transactional
records, such as source documents, accounting records and schedules and bank statements must be retained as well.
