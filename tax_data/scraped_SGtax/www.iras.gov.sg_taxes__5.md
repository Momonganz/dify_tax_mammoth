### \#3 Non-cash gifts and prize money

[**Competition winners usually receive non-cash gifts such as trophies, souvenirs or tokens in addition to the prize money. Are such gifts subject to withholding tax?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/payments-to-non-resident-public-entertainer-(artiste-musician-sportsman-etc-)/treatment-of-income-for-non-resident-public-entertainer#competition-winners-usually-receive-non-cash-gifts-such-as-trophies--souvenirs-or-tokens-in-addition-to-the-prize-money--are-such-gifts-subject-to-withholding-tax-)

Such gifts are not subject to withholding tax if they are not substantial in value and are not given in a form of disguised payment for services.

As a guide, a gift is of substantial value if it exceeds $100. If a gift's value is $100 or more, the full value of the gift is subject to withholding tax.

The threshold of $100 is applicable per event. For example, if a sportsman has won a gift in two events, both gifts are not subject to withholding tax if each gift does not exceed $100.
