It does not matter where the board meeting was held or that the individual was not physically working in Singapore. Such payments are taxable regardless of the physical presence in Singapore.

**Director's obligations**

Filing of tax returns

If the director has received a tax return/tax bill and is only in receipt of director's remuneration, please [contact us](https://www.iras.gov.sg/contact-us)

[**FAQs**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/payments-to-non-resident-director/tax-obligations-for-non-resident-director#faqs)

### \#1 Must a non-resident director file an income tax return?

No. Since the employer has accounted for withholding tax, the non-resident director would only need to file an income tax return if he/she has other sources of income.

### \#2 Must the employer file Form IR21 and apply the deem exercise rule on the non-resident director's unexercised stock options when he resigns from his directorship?

No. Instead the employer must file a [Form IR21A](https://www.iras.gov.sg/docs/default-source/individual-income-tax/non-residents/ir21a.doc?sfvrsn=4a13e163_7 "Form IR21A") to report the gains from ESOP/ESOW within 30 days from the date of exercise, assignment, release or acquisition of the shares.
