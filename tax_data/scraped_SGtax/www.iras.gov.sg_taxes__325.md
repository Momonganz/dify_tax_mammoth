## Recovering expenses from clients

In the course of providing consultancy or professional services, you may pay for expenses on behalf of your client. When you subsequently recover the expenses from your client, the GST treatment of the recovery depends on whether you have acted as a principal or agent in purchasing the goods or services:

- If you have incurred the expenses as a principal, you must charge GST if the recovery constitutes a taxable supply of goods or services.
- If you have incurred the expenses as an agent, you need not charge GST as the recovery does not constitute a supply.

For more information on the GST treatment for the recovery of expenses, please refer to [**Recovering Expenses**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/charging-gst-(output-tax)/common-scenarios---do-i-charge-gst/recovering-expenses-(re-billing) "Recovering expenses (re-billing)").
