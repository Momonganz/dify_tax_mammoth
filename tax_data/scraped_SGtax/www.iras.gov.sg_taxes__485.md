The majority of companies pay their taxes on time. The payment due date is 1 month from the date of the Notice of Assessment (Tax Bill). Your company will incur penalties and face recovery actions for late or non-payment of taxes.

On this page:

## Consequences for late payment or non-payment of taxes

IRAS may take the following actions if you fail to pay by the due date:

1. Impose late payment penalties
2. Appoint agents like your company’s bank, tenant or lawyer (handling the sale of any of your property) to recover the overdue tax
3. Take legal action

The above list is not exhaustive.

## Late payment penalty

A 5% late payment penalty will be imposed on the unpaid tax if full payment is not received by the due date.

[**Example 1: Penalty imposed for late payment**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-payment/late-payment-or-non-payment-of-corporate-income-tax#example-1--penalty-imposed-for-late-payment)

Company X received an NOA dated 2 Jun 2025. The due date for the tax payable of $10,000 is 2 Jul 2025 (one month from the date of NOA). As Company X did not pay the tax by 2 Jul 2025, a 5% late payment penalty of $500 (i.e. 5% x $10,000) was imposed.

| Date of NOA | Corporate Income Tax Due Date | Tax Payable | 5% Late Payment Penalty Imposed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Date of NOA** 2 Jun 2025 | **Corporate Income Tax Due Date** 2 Jul 2025 | **Tax Payable** $10,000 | **5% Late Payment Penalty Imposed** $500 |

If you have filed an objection and are awaiting the outcome, you still must pay the tax assessed as shown in the NOA. Excess payment will be refunded to your company if the assessment is revised.

[**Example 2: Penalties and refunds when an objection is filed**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-payment/late-payment-or-non-payment-of-corporate-income-tax#example-2--penalties-and-refunds-when-an-objection-is-filed)

Company Y received an estimated NOA, with a tax payable of $10,000, dated 1 Aug 2025. The due date for payment is 1 Sep 2025 (one month from the date of NOA).

The company filed an objection and did not pay the tax. As no payment was received by the due date, a 5% late payment penalty of $500 was imposed.

The company paid the tax and penalty on 30 Sep 2025. On 9 Oct 2025, the Assessment was amended to $1,300 and the late payment penalty was revised to $65 (5% late payment penalty on $1,300) accordingly. A refund of $9,135 was made to the company.

| Date of NOA | Due Date on NOA | Tax Amount | 5% Late Payment Penalty Imposed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Date of NOA** 1 Aug 2025 | **Due Date on NOA** 1 Sep 2025 | **Tax Amount** $10,000 | **5% Late Payment Penalty Imposed** $500 |
| **Date of NOA** 9 Oct 2025 | **Due Date on NOA** 1 Sep 2025 | **Tax Amount**($8,700) | **5% Late Payment Penalty Imposed**($435) |
| **Date of NOA** Revised Tax and 5% Penalty | **Due Date on NOA** | **Tax Amount** $1,300 | **5% Late Payment Penalty Imposed** $65 |

If the tax remains unpaid 60 days after the imposition of the 5% late payment penalty, an additional penalty of 1% per month may be imposed for every completed month that the tax remains unpaid, up to a maximum of 12% of the unpaid tax.

[**Example 3: Penalty imposed for continued late payment**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-payment/late-payment-or-non-payment-of-corporate-income-tax#example-3--penalty-imposed-for-continued-late-payment)

Company Z did not pay the tax payable of $10,000 by the due date on the NOA, and received a late payment penalty notice dated 1 Jul 2025 informing the company of the overdue tax and the 5% late payment penalty.

The due date for payment of tax and penalty (i.e. $10,500) on the notice was 1 Aug 2025 (one month from the date of the late payment penalty notice).

As the tax was unpaid for 1 completed month after 60 days from the late payment penalty notice due date, a 1% additional penalty was imposed on 1 Oct 2025. 1% penalty will continue to be imposed for each additional month that the tax remained unpaid.


Company Z eventually paid the tax and penalties on 15 Nov 2025.

The total penalty imposed was $700 (i.e. 5% penalty x $10,000 plus 1% additional penalty x $10,000 x 2 months).

| Late Payment Penalty Notice Date | Payment Date | 5% Late Payment Penalty Imposed | Additional 1% Penalty Impose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Late Payment Penalty Notice Date** 1 Jul 2025 | **Payment Date** 15 Nov 2025 | **5% Late Payment Penalty Imposed** <br>$500<br>($10,000 x 5%) | **Additional 1% Penalty Impose** <br>$200<br>($10,000 x 1% x 2 months) |

### Appealing for waiver of late payment penalty

You can refer to [Corporate Income Tax payments](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/payments?taxtype=Corporate%20Income%20Tax) for the various payment modes and processing times.

## Appointment of agents

If the tax remains unpaid, IRAS may appoint agents such as your company’s bank, tenant, lawyer or other 3rd parties with money due to you to recover the outstanding taxes.

When your company’s bank is appointed as an agent, you will experience inconvenience in using the bank accounts (e.g. being unable to access the bank accounts) until you have fully paid your Corporate Income Tax.

Requests for the release of your banks from the agent appointment made after 12pm on weekdays will only be processed on the next working day. Please note that requests cannot be processed on Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays.

Agents will be released from the appointment only after the tax and penalties have been paid in full.

## Checking tax balance and making payment

To check your current balance, log in to [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx) and select "View Account Summary”. You can make Corporate Income Tax payments through various [payment modes](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-payment/paying-corporate-income-taxes "payment modes").

### Difficulty paying your tax

If you [face difficulties with your tax payment](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-payment/experiencing-difficulties-in-paying-your-tax), you may apply for a longer payment plan via the [Apply/Manage GIRO Plan](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/portal/giro/apply/select-bank) digital service at [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx).

If your payment plan is approved, you must follow the payment plan schedule. Otherwise, the plan will be cancelled and actions will be taken to recover the tax.

### GIRO cancellation or termination

You are advised to maintain sufficient funds in your bank account. If your GIRO deduction fails due to insufficient funds or incorrect limits set, etc., IRAS will cancel your GIRO plan. The balance of the unpaid taxes will become due and payable immediately. You may incur a penalty if you do not settle the unpaid taxes promptly.

If you repeatedly default on your payment plan, IRAS may reject your subsequent requests for payment arrangements.
