## Purpose of ACAP

GST ACAP is a compliance initiative for businesses that set up robust GST Control Framework as part of good corporate governance.

Businesses may, on a voluntary basis, conduct a holistic risk-based review to endorse the effectiveness of their GST controls.

In the long run, with a structure and a visible tax function properly set up to manage the proper accounting of GST on the business transactions, businesses would have sustainable compliance framework to ensure correct GST reporting on an ongoing
basis.

In turn, a reduced risk of non-compliance with GST law ("GST risks") ultimately allows businesses to reap productivity gains - savings in both time and money.

## Adoption of ACAP

Since the introduction of ACAP in 2011, over 1000 businesses from different industries have successfully applied for ACAP.

As at 31 Dec 2021, more than 600 businesses have attained ACAP status.

More than 90% of businesses with ACAP status expiring have applied for [renewal](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/getting-it-right/voluntary-compliance-initiatives/assisted-compliance-assurance-programme-(acap)#title13 "renewal").

You can access whether your GST Control Framework is ready for ACAP by completing the  [Self-Review of GST Controls](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/gst/self-review-of-gst-controls-checklists.xlsx?sfvrsn=19f821fd_37 "Self-review of GST Controls") (XLS, 986KB).

## Independent ACAP Reviewers

ACAP must be conducted by an independent ACAP Reviewer to verify that the GST Controls at Entity, Transaction and GST Reporting Levels are
working well for the 12-month period of review ("ACAP Period").

The ACAP Reviewer can be:

1. A Public Accounting Entity (PAE) or its tax affiliate where the team lead is an Accredited^ Tax Advisor (GST) of Singapore Chartered Tax Professionals Limited (SCTP); or

2. An independent in-house Internal Audit (IA) team and the team member is an Accredited^ Tax Practitioner (GST) or an Accredited Tax Advisor (GST) of SCTP; or
3. A team comprising both (1) and (2).

The scope of review of GST Controls is based on the methodology set out in Appendix 1 of the e-Tax Guide on  [GST: Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme (ACAP)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide-gst-acap-(eleventh-edition).pdf?sfvrsn=d69e66ec_57 "GST: Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme (ACAP)")  (PDF, 1,744KB).

^ For more details on accreditation of tax advisors or tax practitioners, please refer to the  [SCTP](https://sctp.org.sg/ "SIATP") website.

## How does ACAP work?

The ACAP process is a 4-step process as follows:

![ACAP process](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/images/default-source/uploadedimages/pages/4-step-process.png?sfvrsn=e6a99292_6)

For details of each step, please read the [e-Tax Guide](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide-gst-acap-(eleventh-edition).pdf?sfvrsn=d69e66ec_57) on ACAP (PDF, 1,744KB).

## ACAP Premium and Merit status

When your independent ACAP Reviewer verifies that your GST controls at all three levels are working well in managing GST risks and ensuring continual GST compliance and you attain certain benchmarks in the level of controls, you will be accorded either:

1. 'ACAP Premium' status (for 5 years); or
2. 'ACAP Merit' status (for 3 years).

To find out the details of the benchmarks required for the three level of controls, please read paragraph 10 of the [e-Tax Guide](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide-gst-acap-(eleventh-edition).pdf?sfvrsn=d69e66ec_57) on ACAP (PDF, 1,744KB).

## After award of ACAP status

You have to perform two Post ACAP Reviews ("PAR") to ensure accuracy of your past GST returns filed. Timely disclosure of errors will enjoy waiver of penalties or reduced penalties under IRAS' Voluntary Disclosure Programme.

To find out the details on PAR, please read paragraph 11.2 of the [e-Tax Guide](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide-gst-acap-(eleventh-edition).pdf?sfvrsn=d69e66ec_57) on ACAP (PDF, 1,744KB).

## Benefits of ACAP

You will enjoy the following benefits during the five-year or three-year period of your ACAP Status:

1. Step down of IRAS-GST compliance activities unless significant anomalies are noted in your GST declarations;

2. Expeditious GST refunds, if no anomalies are noted;

3. Expeditious handling of your GST rulings and GST issues; and

4. Auto-renewal of GST schemes (e.g. Major Exporter Scheme), if applicable.

## Penalty waiver for participating in ACAP

Businesses adopting ACAP framework show their commitment towards proactive tax risk management and in building a robust GST compliance infrastructure to ensure GST compliance on an ongoing basis.

To signal support for businesses that have implemented effective GST Control Framework and sought independent verification that the controls work well, IRAS will offer one-time waiver of penalties\* for voluntary disclosure of the past non-fraudulent GST errors under the first ACAP conducted. To be eligible for the penalty waiver, businesses must complete the conduct of ACAP within 15 months of IRAS’ acceptance of ACAP participation and attain an ACAP status.

\\* The one-time penalty waiver benefit for ACAP is subject to IRAS' periodic review of the programme.

## Applying for ACAP

To apply for ACAP, please complete form [GST F23 - Participation in GST Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme (ACAP)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/docx/gst-f23(1).docx?sfvrsn=208599b7_12 "GST_F23") (Word, 53KB).

If you do not wish to undertake ACAP, you are encouraged to adopt the GST Control Practices in the Self-Review of GST Controls to enhance your GST Control Framework and improve GST compliance capability, where appropriate.

## Renewing ACAP status

If you are intending to renew your ACAP status, you should initiate the process at the start of the last year of your ACAP status. You will not be required to perform the second Post ACAP Review (PAR) if you renew your ACAP status, which is due 6
months before the expiry date of your ACAP status.

Your renewed ACAP status will be valid for 6 years for 'ACAP Premium' status or 4 years for 'ACAP Merit' status.

The scope of review for ACAP Renewal is less intensive than the first-time ACAP review. The key differences are as follows:

1. The Test Period for the conduct of review testing is reduced to 3 months (first-time ACAP Review: 6 months).
2. Walk-through is only required on tax classification controls instead of the entire transaction process.
3. Tests of controls are required only if there are new or major changes to business processes (e.g. outsourcing, new accounting software) since the last PAR.
4. A lower sample size to conduct substantive review of documents.

You have to engage an [independent reviewer](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/getting-it-right/voluntary-compliance-initiatives/assisted-compliance-assurance-programme-(acap)#title6 "Independent ACAP Reviewers") to conduct a review of your past GST returns filed in a 12-month period ("Review Year").
