## Information for Owners who are going through En bloc Sales

![Enbloc-PT info](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/images/default-source/uploadedimages/pages/enbloc-pt-info.jpg?sfvrsn=a09b8f28_0)

Property tax is payable yearly in advance by the due date stated in your property tax bill. You are required to pay the full year tax before you sell your property.

If you have not paid the full year tax and do not have a GIRO instalment plan, you are advised to check your outstanding property tax and make payment before the completion of sale of your property.

If you are paying tax by GIRO, please consult your lawyer on the settlement of the outstanding property tax due for the rest of the year with the buyer of your property.

You should then seek reimbursement from the purchaser-developer on their share of property tax for which they should be responsible. Your lawyer should assist you with this.
