## Reporting in GST Return

### 1.  Importing goods

When you import your own goods and goods belonging to your overseas principals (who are not GST-registered or are registered for GST under the OVR regime as pay-only persons) using your Approved 3PL Company Scheme status, you should declare the value
of imports in:

1. Box 5 (Total value of taxable purchases); and
2. Box 9 (Total value of goods imported under MES/ Approved 3PL Company Scheme or Other Approved Schemes).

They must be supported by valid ME permits and relevant supporting documents (e.g. commercial invoices and appropriate shipping documents).

As GST on imports has been suspended (i.e. not paid), you should not claim any input tax.

### 2.  Zero GST (ZG) Warehouses

When you import your own goods and goods belonging to your overseas principals (who are not GST-registered or are registered for GST under the OVR regime as pay-only persons) into a [Zero GST (ZG) Warehouse](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/zero-gst-warehouse-scheme "Zero GST (ZG) Warehouse"), you must declare the imports in your GST return despite the suspension of GST.

You should declare the value of imports in Box 5 (Total value of taxable purchases) even though GST is suspended.

When the imported goods are later removed from ZG Warehouse into customs territory using your Approved 3PL Company Scheme status, you should declare the value of goods removed in:

1. Box 5 (Total value of taxable purchases); and
2. Box 9 (Total value of goods imported under MES/ Approved 3PL Company Scheme or Other Approved Schemes).

They must be supported by valid ME / MC / Customs permits and relevant supporting documents (e.g. commercial invoices and appropriate shipping documents).

As GST on imports has been suspended (i.e. not paid), you should not claim any input tax.

### 3.  Supplying the imported goods locally to persons who are approved under MES/ AISS/ ACMT Scheme/ Approved 3PL Company Scheme

You do not need to charge GST on such supplies.

You are still required to include such supplies in Box 1 (Total value of standard-rated supplies) of your GST return.

As payment of GST is not required on these supplies, you do not declare any output tax in Box 6 (Output tax due).

Your tax invoices issued for such supplies need not reflect the GST amount and must include the description “Payment of
GST is not required under the Approved Third Party Logistics Company Scheme”.

The recipients of your goods (i.e. persons who are approved under MES/ AISS/ ACMT Scheme/ Approved 3PL Company Scheme) should declare their purchases of
the imported goods from you in their GST returns in:

1. Box 5 (Total value of taxable purchases); and
2. Box 9 (Total value of goods imported under MES/ Approved 3PL Company Scheme or Other Approved Schemes).
