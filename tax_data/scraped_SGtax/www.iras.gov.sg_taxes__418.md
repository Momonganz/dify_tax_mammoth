## Receiving GST refunds

From 3 Jan 2022, IRAS will no longer issue cheques for GST refunds. Refunds will be made via GIRO or PayNow. If you have signed up for both GST GIRO refund and PayNow, refunds will be credited to the GIRO bank account. To ensure that you receive your
GST refunds, please sign up for [GIRO](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/forms/other-taxes-and-services/giro-application-forms) or [PayNow](https://www.abs.org.sg/consumer-banking/pay-now) with your business/ organisation's bank account. For more information, please refer to the FAQs on [Mandate Electronic Refund for GST](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/faqs-mandate-e-refund-for-gst.pdf?sfvrsn=1f861536_10) (PDF, 256KB).

Any GST refund will be made to you within a period equivalent to your prescribed accounting period, from the date the Comptroller receives your GST return.

[**Example: GST refunds**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/filing-gst/due-dates-and-requests-for-extension#example--gst-refunds)

If you are under a quarterly GST accounting cycle, the refund will be made to you within three months from the date the Comptroller receives your GST return.

This does not apply under [certain circumstances](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/refunds) such as when you have outstanding GST returns which are not submitted, or when your GST return is being
reviewed by our auditor.
