If you are a bona fide traveller (excluding holders of work permits, employment passes, student passes, dependent passes or long-term passes), you will be given GST relief on new articles, souvenirs, gifts and food preparations that you bring into Singapore
which are for your personal use. The relief does not apply to intoxicating liquor and tobacco, as well as goods imported for commercial purposes.

Where the value of the goods exceeds the GST relief limit, the excess is subject to GST.
