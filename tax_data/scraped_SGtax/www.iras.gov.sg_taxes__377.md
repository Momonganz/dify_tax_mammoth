## Tax Treatment of Employers’ CPF Contributions (Summary Table)

| Nature | Taxable or Not Taxable |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Compulsory CPF Contributions relating to employment in Singapore | Not taxable |
| **2** | Voluntary CPF Contributions relating to employment in Singapore, i.e. amount in excess of compulsory contributions to be made by employer | Taxable |

## Compulsory CPF Contributions

The CPF Act determines the amount of compulsory CPF contributions on Ordinary and Additional Wages that employers should make for their employees who are Singapore Citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents (SPRs).

Compulsory CPF Contributions relating to employment in Singapore are **not taxable.**

## Voluntary CPF Contributions

Employers may also make voluntary CPF contributions to an employee's CPF account.

Voluntary CPF contributions made by the employer relating to employment in Singapore are **taxable** . The employer must prepare Form IR8S if there is excess CPF contributions made in the current year and give the form to the
employee.

If the excess employer's contributions have been brought to tax and the employer has claimed or is claiming a refund, the employee should forward the completed Form IR8S to IRAS. IRAS will then review the employee's assessment accordingly.

### Singapore Permanent Residents (SPRs)

An SPR employee is required to make CPF contributions at a lower rate in the first two years after attaining PR status. After the two years, the full rates come into effect.

If CPF Board approves the application to pay full rates in the first two years after attaining PR status, the full-rate contributions made by the SPR and his employer would be treated as compulsory contributions.

[**Ordinary Wage (OW) and Additional Wage (AW)**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/employers/understanding-the-tax-treatment/central-provident-fund-(cpf)-contributions#ordinary-wage--ow--and-additional-wage--aw-)

**Ordinary Wage (OW)** refers to wages due or granted wholly and exclusively for an employee's employment in that month. OW includes allowances (e.g. food allowance and overtime payments) earned by an employee in the month. OW must
be paid before the due date for payment of CPF contributions for that month.

**Additional Wage** (AW) refers to wages which are not granted wholly and exclusively for the month such as annual bonus, leave pay and incentive payments.

Please find more details in the  [Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board's website](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/employer/employer-obligations/how-much-cpf-contributions-to-pay "Central Provident Fund Board's website") .

The AW Ceiling sets the maximum amount of AW that CPF contributions are payable.

The AW Ceiling from 2016 is as follows:

$102,000^ less Total Ordinary Wages subject to CPF for the year

^Equivalent to 17 months x $6,000

**NEW!**

As announced in Budget 2023, the current CPF monthly salary ceiling of $6,000 will be increased to $8,000 in four phases starting from 1 September 2023.

Notwithstanding the increases to the CPF monthly salary ceiling starting from 1 September 2023, the CPF annual salary ceiling will remain at $102,000. The additional wage ceiling will also remain at $102,000 less total ordinary wages subject to CPF for the relevant year.
