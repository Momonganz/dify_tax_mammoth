## Transport Expenses for Discharging Official Duties

If transport expenses are incurred for discharging official duties, for example, travelling from office to meet a client, the reimbursements are not taxable.

Reimbursements made for travelling between home and external venues for business (e.g. external meeting place with clients, external venue for trainings, seminars, workshops, courses and retreats) are also not taxable.

Per-trip allowance for actual trip made is not taxable.

## Reimbursement on Mileage for Private Cars

Reimbursements on private mileage is taxable.

Reimbursements on mileage incurred on the following trips are not taxable:

1.  Between office and external business meeting venues (e.g. client's office);
2.  Between home and airport for the purpose of overseas business trips;
3.  Between home and external business meeting venues; and
4.  Between home and office when working overtime.

The rate of reimbursement for mileage depends on the company's policy. While there is no prescribed standard mileage rate, the reimbursements made by the company should be reasonable.

## Transport for Working Overtime

Overtime transport allowance and reimbursement paid to employees are **not taxable** provided that:

1.  The allowance/ reimbursement is meant for working beyond official working hours (i.e. working before or after the official working hours on normal work days, or working on off days, weekends and public holidays) on an ad-hoc basis; and
2.  The payment policy is generally available to all staff.

The payments are also not taxable if the policy applies only to staff at the lower level.
