An advance ruling is a written interpretation of the Income Tax Act 1947 on how certain issues that arise from a proposed arrangement are to be treated for tax purposes. A ruling request has to be one where there are issues that require interpretation of the law, and not one seeking to know what the law clearly provides (e.g. what is the basis period for trade income).

## Applying for Income Tax Advance Ruling

[**Scope of Income Tax Advance Ruling**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/specific-topics/advance-ruling-system-for-income-tax#scope-of-income-tax-advance-ruling)

An advance ruling **only applies to the applicant and the particular arrangement** that was the subject of the ruling request and, where applicable, to the year(s) or period(s), and provisions
of the Income Tax Act 1947 stated in the ruling. It binds the Comptroller of Income Tax to apply the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act 1947 in the manner that was set out in the ruling.

### Declining a Request/ Application for Advance Ruling

Under certain circumstances, IRAS will not or may decline to rule.

Some examples of circumstances where IRAS will not rule are:

- The matter on which the ruling is sought:
  - Involves the interpretation of a foreign law or the application of an Agreement for the Avoidance of Double Taxation

  - Requires IRAS to form an opinion as to a generally accepted accounting principle or a commercially acceptable practice
- IRAS has already raised an assessment (other than an assessment of any estimated tax) for the relevant Year(s) of Assessment in relation to the arrangement
- IRAS has embarked on an audit or investigation on how any provision of the Income Tax Act 1947 applies to the company or to other similar arrangements
- In IRAS' opinion, the application is frivolous or vexatious1, or the company is not seriously contemplating the arrangement for which the ruling is sought
- The company has not provided sufficient information after IRAS' request for additional information2

Some examples of circumstances where IRAS may decline to rule are:

- The matter on which the ruling is sought:
  - Require IRAS to determine a question of fact3
  - Is subject to an objection or appeal, whether in relation to the company or any other person
  - Does not involve interpretation of any provision of the Income Tax Act 1947 and the tax treatment is clearly provided in the law4
- The correctness of the ruling depends on the making of assumptions, whether in respect of a future event or any other event

_Notes_

_1_ _IRAS will take into account all surrounding circumstances in considering whether an application is frivolous or vexatious. An instance of a vexatious application is where IRAS views that_
_the proposed arrangement is not carried out for bona fide commercial reasons or involves a scheme which has, as 1 of its main purposes, the avoidance or reduction of tax._

_**Example of Vexatious Application 1**_

_Company A, a Singapore incorporated company, is the registered owner of a number of trademarks and receives royalty income from its trademarks. Company A plans to set up a wholly owned subsidiary in a low tax jurisdiction to which it will sell all its trademarks. The transfer price is to be paid by the subsidiary from cash flows generated from the operations as and when available. The subsidiary will then receive royalties from the users of the trademarks and will pay dividends from its profits to Company A. Company A claims that the proposed transfer of trademarks is an outright sale for the subsidiary to exclusively focus on owning and managing the trademarks. However, the subsidiary will not have employees and will use the services of an agent in that jurisdiction to handle its incorporation matters._

_Ruling request:_ _C_ _onfirmation that the gains from sale of trademarks_ _derived by Company A will not be taxed and that future dividends received from the subsidiary will not be taxable in Singapore._

_In IRAS' opinion, the proposed transaction is artificial as the transfer price is payable only as and when cash flows generated from the subsidiary's operations are available. The subsidiary appears to be just a shell company with no employees to manage the trademarks. The main purpose of transferring the trademarks to the subsidiary is to avoid or reduce tax payable and not for bona fide commercial reasons._

_**Example of Vexatious Application 2**_

_Companies X and B are incorporated in Singapore. Company X plans to enter into a distribution agreement with Company B. Company X claims that Company B stipulates that the contracting party of the distribution agreement must be a Singapore incorporated company. Company X does not have employees or operations in Singapore. All of Company X's operations (including the negotiation and signing of the distribution agreement) will be managed and performed by Company Y's employees (on behalf of Company X) in Country Y. Company Y is incorporated in Country Y and is a related party of Company X. The income from reselling the products (arising from the distributing agreement) will be booked in Company X's books. Company X is not able to substantiate why its operations cannot be performed in Singapore._

_Ruling request: Confirmation that Company X's income arising from the distribution agreement will be considered sourced outside Singapore and the income will not be subject to tax in Singapore._

_In IRAS' opinion, there are no bona fide commercial reasons for having the agreement signed in Country Y and Company Y undertaking the business operations on behalf of Company X, other than for the avoidance or reduction of tax._

_2_ _IRAS may decline to rule if the company does not provide the requested information within three months from the date of IRAS’ request for additional information._

_3_ _Example of applications that may require IRAS to determine a question of fact include those seeking IRAS' confirma_ _tion on:_

- _The_ _nature and taxability of the gains to be derived from the sale of properties or shares_
- _Whether there was a change of intention with respect to the holding of a property (e.g. from investment holding to property trading or vice versa)_
- _Tax residency status of a company_

_IRAS will consider the merits of the application on a case-by-case basis and can, at our discretion, decline to make a ruling._

_4_ _Example of applications that does not involve interpretation of any provision of the Income Tax Act 1947 (ITA):_

|  | _Example_ | _Remarks_ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _1_ | **_Example_** _Whether dividends receivable by Company A from its subsidiary, which is a Singapore tax resident company, will be tax exempt under Section 13(1)(za) of the ITA._ | **_Remarks_** <br>_This ruling request does not involve an interpretation of the provision of the ITA as Section 13(1)(za) clearly provides that any dividends paid on or after 1 January 2008 by any company resident in Singapore is exempt from tax._ |
| _2_ | **_Example_** <br>_The principal activity of Company A is that of an investment holding company. It has held 80% of the ordinary shares in Company B since Company B’s incorporation in 2019. The business of Company A and Company B are not that of trading or holding of immovable properties. Company A intends to dispose of all the shares in Company B and_<br>_seeks IRAS' confirmation that the gains from the disposal will qualify for tax exemption under Section 13W of the ITA. Company A confirms that all the conditions in Section 13W have been met._ | **_Remarks_** <br>_Section 13W of the ITA clearly stipulates the conditions for the exemption from tax on any gains or profits derived by a company from the disposal of ordinary shares in another company. As the company has confirmed that all the stipulated conditions have been met, the ruling request does not involve any interpretation of the law._ |
| _3_ | **_Example_** _Company A has a subsidiary that is incorporated and tax resident in Country X. The headline tax rate and dividend withholding tax rate in Country X is 20% and 10% respectively. Company A seeks IRAS’ confirmation that the conditions__f_ _or tax exemption under Section 13(8) of the ITA are met in respect of the dividends to be received in Singapore from its subsidiary in Country X._ | **_Remarks_** <br>_Whether the dividends qualify for tax exemption under Section 13(8) of the ITA is subject to Company A meeting the conditions for exemption as at the time the dividends are received in Singapore, and the conditions under Section 13(8) are prescriptive. The confirmation sought does not involve an interpretation of the law._ |
