## Withholding tax

The [non-resident professional](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/payments-to-non-resident-professional-(consultant-trainer-coach-etc-)/non-resident-professional)'s
income attributable to services rendered in Singapore is subject to withholding tax at:

1. 15% of the gross income due and payable to the non-resident professional; **OR**
2. 24%\* of net income due and payable to the non-resident professional (if the non-resident professional has elected to be taxed on net income).

\*The
withholding tax rate of 24% applies for income due and payable on or after 1 Jan 2023. If the income is due and payable between 1 Jan 2016 and 31 Dec 2022, the withholding tax rate on net income will be 22%.

The non-resident professional will not be subject to withholding tax on income attributable to services rendered wholly outside Singapore, even though his/her income may be paid by a company in Singapore.

## Tax obligations of payer

The payer must:

1. e-File via [myTax Portal](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx) with his/her Singpass / [Singpass Foreign user Account (SFA)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/digital-services/others/singpass-foreign-user-account-(sfa)-for-foreign-individuals) and select the nature of payment as ‘For payment to non-resident individual / firms exercising profession/vocation in Singapore’; and
2. Pay the withholding tax by the 15th of the second month from the [date of payment](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/withholding-tax-filing/withholding-tax-filing-and-payment-due-date#title1) to the non-resident professional.

Please refer to [How to file](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/withholding-tax-filing/how-to-file) and [Tax Payment](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/payments?taxtype=Withholding%20Tax) for more details on withholding tax filing and payment matter.

IRAS will not send any tax bill to the non-resident professional as the payer has already accounted for withholding tax. However, the payer will receive a [Confirmation of Payment](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/withholding-tax-payments/confirmation-of-payment-(cp)) letter (i.e. withholding tax receipt) showing the withholding tax amount received by IRAS.

The payer may wish to pass a copy of the Confirmation of Payment letter to the non-resident professional for record purposes.

## Tax obligations of non-resident professional

The non-resident professional does not need to file any Income Tax Return with IRAS as the payer has:

- withheld tax at source;
- e-Filed the withholding tax; and
- paid the withholding tax amount to IRAS.

However, if the non-resident professional receives an Income Tax Return (Form B/B1/M) and/or income tax bill (Notice of Assessment) from IRAS, and is only in receipt of income as a non-resident professional; please email us via:
