## Tax Governance Framework (“TGF”)

TGF is a voluntary compliance initiative that a company may participate in to demonstrate that it has good [tax governance and tax risks management](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-compliance/about-tax-governance-and-tax-risk-management). Adopting the framework helps companies attain and maintain good standards of tax governance and raises
tax governance to attention at the Board level. The framework features a set of broad principles and key practices which a company should incorporate in its tax governance policy for effective management of tax risks. In the long run, a company’s
commitment to the TGF supports a collaborative and trusting relationship between the company and IRAS, leading to lower compliance costs.

## Businesses suited for TGF

Any company can commit to the TGF. In particular, the TGF is suited for companies that:

- Have complex structures and business models;
- Recognise the importance of tax accountability and transparency; and
- Are willing to commit to good tax governance practices.

## Building blocks of TGF

The TGF sets out the principles and key practices centred around 3 essential building blocks of good tax governance. It is applicable to both Corporate Income Tax and GST.

[**Corporate Income Tax**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/getting-it-right/tax-governance-and-tax-risk-management/tax-governance-framework-(-tgf-)#corporate-income-tax)

A company submits its TGF application on 1 Mar 2022 and this is approved by IRAS on 30 Apr 2022. The company will enjoy a one-time extended grace period of 2 years for corporate tax errors voluntarily disclosed between 30 Apr 2022 to 29 Apr 2024. On 31 May 2022, the company makes a voluntary disclosure of corporate income tax errors for the Year of Assessment 2020.

In the absence of the TGF benefit, these errors will attract a penalty as they are disclosed after the 1-year grace period (from 1 Dec 2020 to 30 Nov 2021). However, as the company is entitled to the TGF benefits and the errors fall within the extended grace period of 2 years (from 1 Dec 2020 to 30 Nov 2022), the errors will not attract a penalty.

[**Withholding Tax**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/getting-it-right/tax-governance-and-tax-risk-management/tax-governance-framework-(-tgf-)#withholding-tax)

A company submits its TGF application on 1 Mar 2022 and this is approved by IRAS on 30 Apr 2022. The company will enjoy a one-time extended grace period of 2 years for withholding tax errors voluntarily disclosed between 30 Apr 2022 to 29 Apr 2024.

If the company makes a payment to a non-resident on 1 Jan 2021, it will need to file and pay withholding tax to IRAS by 15 Mar 2021. On 31 May 2022, the company makes a voluntary disclosure of a withholding tax error in relation to this payment to a non-resident.

In the absence of the TGF benefit, this error will attract a penalty as it is disclosed after the 1-year grace period from the statutory filing deadline (from 15 Mar 2021 to 15 Mar 2022). However, as the company is entitled to the TGF benefits and the error is disclosed within the extended grace period of 2 years from the statutory filing deadline (from 15 Mar 2021 to 15 Mar 2023), the error will not attract a penalty.


[**GST**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/getting-it-right/tax-governance-and-tax-risk-management/tax-governance-framework-(-tgf-)#gst)

A GST-registered company (not under GST group or divisional registration) submits its TGF application on 1 Mar 2022 and this is approved by IRAS on 30 Apr 2022. On 30 Apr 2023, the company makes a voluntary disclosure of GST errors for the period from 1 Jan
2019 to 31 Dec 2022.

The TGF benefit applies as the GST errors are disclosed within 2 years from the date of our approval of the TGF application, i.e. 30 Apr 2022.

## FAQs

[**I belong to a local corporate group where my parent company has published a group tax governance policy. Do I still have to publish my own tax governance policy to apply for TGF?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/getting-it-right/tax-governance-and-tax-risk-management/tax-governance-framework-(-tgf-)#i-belong-to-a-local-corporate-group-where-my-parent-company-has-published-a-group-tax-governance-policy--do-i-still-have-to-publish-my-own-tax-governance-policy-to-apply-for-tgf-)

Companies of a corporate group are generally expected to adhere to the same tax governance principles set by the parent company, as these should be cascaded down and applied consistently across the group.

When you apply for TGF, you can rely on the group tax governance policy that is published by your parent company if the group tax governance policy applies to you and it is clear from the group tax governance policy that it applies to all companies under the group.

[**I am part of a foreign multinational corporation and hence I have to adhere to the global tax governance policy that is published by my foreign parent company on the global corporate website. I am unable to publish my own local tax governance policy. Can I still apply for TGF?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/getting-it-right/tax-governance-and-tax-risk-management/tax-governance-framework-(-tgf-)#i-am-part-of-a-foreign-multinational-corporation-and-hence-i-have-to-adhere-to-the-global-tax-governance-policy-that-is-published-by-my-foreign-parent-company-on-the-global-corporate-website--i-am-unable-to-publish-my-own-local-tax-governance-policy--can-i-still-apply-for-tgf-)

You can apply for TGF if the global tax governance policy is in line with the direction of TGF.

In lieu of publishing your own tax governance policy, you should specify on your website that you adhere to the global tax governance policy and provide the source. Alternatively, the global tax governance policy may also specify that the policy applies to your company (e.g. the policy applies to all companies under the global group). As part of your application, you should provide details on how your tax governance structure and practices are in adherence to the global policy.

[**Do I have to renew my TGF status?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/getting-it-right/tax-governance-and-tax-risk-management/tax-governance-framework-(-tgf-)#do-i-have-to-renew-my-tgf-status-)

No. The TGF status is valid for as long as the tax governance policy remains published on your website or annual report and your tax governance practices continue to adhere to the 3 building blocks of TGF.

IRAS may request for confirmation on your tax governance structure periodically to ensure that you are still adhering to the TGF.


[**Do I have to inform IRAS of any changes in my tax governance policy?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/getting-it-right/tax-governance-and-tax-risk-management/tax-governance-framework-(-tgf-)#do-i-have-to-inform-iras-of-any-changes-in-my-tax-governance-policy-)

There is no need to inform IRAS if your tax governance policy continues to adhere to the 3 building blocks of TGF. However, IRAS may request for confirmation on your tax governance structure periodically to ensure that you are still adhering to the TGF.

If your tax governance policy no longer adheres to the 3 building blocks of TGF, or if you no longer meet the requirements of the TGF, you should inform IRAS in writing.

[**Can I subsequently withdraw from TGF?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/getting-it-right/tax-governance-and-tax-risk-management/tax-governance-framework-(-tgf-)#can-i-subsequently-withdraw-from-tgf-)

A request to withdraw from TGF should be made in writing.

The adoption of TGF demonstrates your willingness and commitment to establish good tax governance standards in your company.

We will assess your reasons for withdrawal from the programme and take this into account in your risk profile with IRAS.
