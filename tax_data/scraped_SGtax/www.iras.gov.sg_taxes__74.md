Property tax rates on owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied residential properties are applied on a progressive scale. All other properties are taxed at 10% of the Annual Value.

On this page:

## Property tax formula

Annual property tax is calculated by multiplying the [Annual Value (AV)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/property-tax/property-owners/annual-value "How Annual Value (AV) is Determined and Revised") of the property with the Property Tax Rates that apply to you.

For example, if the AV of your property is $30,000 and your tax rate is 10%, you would pay $30,000 x 10% = $3,000 in property taxes.

## Owner-occupier tax rates (residential properties)

Owner-occupied residential properties are condominiums, HDB flats or other residential properties where the owner lives in ("occupies") the property. Owner-occupied residential properties enjoy [owner-occupier tax rates](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/property-tax/property-owners/property-tax-reliefs/lower-property-tax-rates-for-owner-occupied-residential-properties "owner-occupier tax rates").
