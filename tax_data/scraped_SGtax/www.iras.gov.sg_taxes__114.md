## Who are licensed international marketing agents & representatives

Licensed international marketing agents & representatives refer to persons\* who hold valid licences issued by [Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) of Singapore](https://www.gra.gov.sg/licenses-approvals/licences-for-casino-operators-businesses/international-market-agents). They are the ones allowed to organise or conduct casino marketing arrangements with casino operators
in Singapore.

These "Licensed International Market Agents" (licensed IMAs) and "Licensed International Market Agents Representatives" (licensed IMA reps) are generally known as junket promoters and junket representatives respectively.

A junket promoter is a person\* who organises or conducts a
casino marketing arrangement with a casino operator.

A junket representative is an individual who is employed by a junket promoter to organise or conduct a casino marketing arrangement on behalf of the junket promoter.

_\*A person includes a company, body of persons and individual_

## Taxation of Licensed IMAs

Income derived in Singapore and received by a licensed IMA is subject to tax in Singapore under section 10(1) of the Income Tax Act (ITA).

Income refers to any commission or other payments received by a licensed IMA for organising or conducting a casino marketing arrangement with a casino operator in Singapore.

## **Taxable types of income received by licensed IMAs & licensed IMA reps**

The following types of income is taxable and must be reported to IRAS for Income Tax purposes.

### 1\. Commission Income

This refers to commissions (including incentives, complimentaries, any cash and non-cash benefits) received from casino operators.

Commissions also include any payment (both cash and non-cash benefits) from parties, other than the casino operators,
for ancillary services such as travel arrangements and entertainment.

### 2\. Interest Income

This refers to the interest income earned from the extension of credit to players.

### 3\. Tips

This refers to gratuities received from players, the casino operators or other parties.

For example, when a player wins in the casino and gives the licensed IMAs/IMA reps some extra money (commonly known as _hong pow_), this amount is taxable income even if it is received in the form of chips or valuables.

For a self-employed individual or a company, such _hong pow_ is considered as trade income, while for an employee, it is considered as a perquisite of his employment.

### 4\. Tokes

Tokes are winnings from bets that are received from bets placed on behalf of the licensed IMAs/IMA reps by the players.

## Claimable Expenses

When the licensed IMA is a self-employed individual or a company, the licensed IMA may claim expenses that are wholly and exclusively incurred to earn the income.

These expense includes:

- Business office expenses

- Complimentaries and gifts

- Entertainment (excluding personal and private expenses)

- Staff salaries

- Travel and transport (excluding private car expenses even if they are incurred for business purposes)

## Keeping proper records

Licensed IMAs have to maintain proper records and accounts of all transactions as IRAS may request them when assessing the income tax.

All accounting records and supporting documents relating to the relevant Year of Assessment (YA) must be kept for **period of 5 years from the relevant YA.**
