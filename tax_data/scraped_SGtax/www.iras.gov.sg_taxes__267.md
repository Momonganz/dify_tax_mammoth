IRAS understands that some taxpayers may occasionally make errors in their tax returns due to lack of care or awareness of their tax obligations. The IRAS Voluntary Disclosure Programme (VDP) encourages taxpayers who have made errors in their tax returns
to come forward voluntarily, in a timely manner, to correct their errors. IRAS is prepared to reduce penalties for voluntary disclosures which meet the qualifying conditions.

On this page:

## Qualifying conditions

The IRAS VDP applies to Income Tax (including cash payouts / bonus), GST, Withholding Tax and Stamp Duty. To qualify for IRAS VDP, you need to submit a voluntary disclosure that is:

- Accurate and complete; and

- Timely and self-initiated.


A voluntary disclosure is considered timely and self-initiated under either one of the following conditions:

- Before you receive a query from IRAS relating to your tax or cash payout / bonus matters; or

- Before you receive notification from IRAS on the commencement of an audit or investigation on your tax or cash payout / bonus matters.


After submitting a voluntary disclosure, you must also:

- Cooperate fully with IRAS to correct the errors made; and

- Pay or make arrangements with IRAS to pay additional taxes or amount exceeding cash payout / bonus than entitled to and penalties imposed (if any), and honour such arrangements till all payments are made.


For examples of qualifying and non-qualifying voluntary disclosures, please refer to Annex C and Annex D respectively of the [e-Tax Guide on IRAS' Voluntary Disclosure Programme](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguides_iras-voluntary-disclosure-programme.pdf?sfvrsn=7eac3cc6_17 "e-Tax Guide on IRAS' Voluntary Disclosure Programme") (PDF, 766KB).

## Voluntary disclosure of past actions involving wilful intent to evade taxes or obtain excessive cash payout / bonus

Taxpayers who commit offences involving wilful intent to evade taxes or obtain excessive cash payout / bonus, including persons who assist in such acts, may face prosecution. Those found guilty may be jailed up to 7 years and/or fined up
to $50,000, and penalised up to 400% of tax undercharged / unpaid.

When you come forward and voluntarily disclose past actions involving a wilful intent to evade taxes or obtain excessive cash payout / bonus, your offences may be compounded at a reduced penalty rate of 200% in lieu of prosecution. This treatment applies
