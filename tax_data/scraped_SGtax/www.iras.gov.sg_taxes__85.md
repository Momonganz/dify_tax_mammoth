Goods that are imported into Singapore by parcel post through ordinary mail or Speedpost (e.g. for goods that are purchased online) are subject to GST. This applies to all new articles, personal articles, souvenirs, gifts, food preparations and dutiable products.

## GST on imported goods

The amount of GST payable is computed based on the [CIF value](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports "CIFÂ value") (cost, insurance and freight) of the goods plus all duties payable. The postage paid for the goods can be taken as freight and insurance charges.

However, GST need not be paid for goods (except for dutiable products) at the point of importation with **CIF value of not more than $400.** Where the CIF value is more than $400, the entire sum will be subject to GST.

The table below explains when GST is to be paid and when it does not need to be paid:

| Total value of goods | Do I need to pay GST? |
| --- | --- |
| $200 | No. The CIF value is not more than $400. |
| $450 | Yes. The CIF value is more than $400. GST payable = $450 X 9% = $40.50 |
