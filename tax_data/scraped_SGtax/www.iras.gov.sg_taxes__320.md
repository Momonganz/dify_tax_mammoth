Payroll software vendors may develop payroll software for employers on the Auto-Inclusion Scheme (AIS) for Employment Income to prepare and submit their employees' income records.

**NEW!**

One-Stop Payroll

The One-Stop Payroll initiative is a joint effort by IRAS, CPFB, MOM, and GovTech, aiming to simplify payroll and employment-related regulatory requirements by allowing businesses/employers to seamlessly submit their payroll and employment-related information to multiple Government agencies directly from their payroll software. In addition to  annual salary data submission under AIS to IRAS, One-Stop Payroll vendors can also support the seamless submission of monthly CPF contributions (and other data) to CPFB, and responses to MOM surveys. **[Find out how you can stand out as a payroll solution by integrating One-Stop Payroll](https://www.onestoppayroll.gov.sg/).**

## Payroll software for AIS submissions

Payroll software that supports AIS submissions must be able to integrate directly with IRAS' server to submit employment income information through [Application Programming Interface (API)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/employers/auto-inclusion-scheme-(ais)-for-employment-income/submit-employment-income-records).

## How to qualify as an AIS payroll software vendor

To qualify and be listed as an AIS payroll software vendor on IRAS’ website for a particular Year of Assessment (YA), you must fulfil all of the following criteria:

- The payroll software vendor should be the developer of the software. Software distributors, resellers or payroll service providers will not be listed.
- The payroll software vendor must complete an annual validation test conducted by IRAS between Sep-Nov of the preceding YA.
- The payroll software must be able to support AIS submissions via API, in accordance with the technical file format/ specifications requirements. Refer to the technical file format/specifications to assess whether your payroll software meets the requirements for API integration. If so, proceed to register your interest with IRAS via the [form](https://go.gov.sg/aisreginterest).


We publish the list of AIS payroll software vendors and recommended controls for payroll software in the [submit employment income records](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/employers/auto-inclusion-scheme-(ais)-for-employment-income/submit-employment-income-records/#title1) webpage.

Do note that IRAS does not endorse your payroll software. Qualifying as an AIS payroll software vendor means that the AIS submissions made through your software can be accepted by IRAS’ system.

**Timeline to qualify as an AIS payroll software vendor for YA 2025 submission**:

Note that there will be no onboarding of new payroll software vendors to the AIS-API for the YA 2025 submission. This is in anticipation of the upcoming major enhancements to the AIS-API that IRAS will be implementing to provide better support for employers in meeting their submission obligations. These changes are scheduled to come into effect from 3Q 2025, in preparation for the YA 2026 submission.

If you are an existing payroll software vendor for YA 2024, you may participate in the annual validation test in order to qualify as an AIS payroll software vendor for YA 2025.

| Validation test period | Website listing period | Qualifying period |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Validation test period** Sep - Nov 2024 | **Website listing period** 1Q to 3Q 2025 | **Qualifying period** YA 20251 |

1Please note that the published file format/ specifications for the YA 2025 submission will be able to support AIS submissions until 3Q 2025, following which enhancements in accordance with the YA 2026 file format/ specifications are required.

## Annual validation test

The validation test ensures that AIS submissions made through your software meets IRAS’ [technical file format/ specifications](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/employers/auto-inclusion-scheme-(ais)-for-employment-income/technical-file-format-specifications "Technical File Format/Specifications") requirements.

IRAS will notify you of the details for the validation test by Sep via email. You must perform a self-verification exercise to ensure that your payroll software can generate and output values according to the sample scenarios provided.

The following items must be submitted to IRAS by 30 Nov:

1. A completed self-verification checklist

2. Submission Reference No(s). submitted to API Sandbox


IRAS may conduct random checks on the submitted test file(s) to verify your validation test results. If the submitted test file(s) fail the validation test, you will not qualify as an AIS payroll software vendor.

## Year of Assessment (YA) 2025 validation test

You only need to complete the validation test for the scenario that corresponds with the forms supported by your payroll software.
