[**Shipping Income under Section 13A**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/specific-industries/shipping-companies#shipping-income-under-section-13a)

Shipping enterprises operating Singapore-registered and foreign ships enjoy tax exemptions on certain types of shipping income under Section 13A of the Income Tax Act 1947. For definitions of shipping enterprise, qualifying company, ship management services,
etc., refer to Section 13A(16).

There is no need to apply to IRAS for these exemptions under Section 13A. If your company derives income that qualifies for the exemptions, you need to only report the amount and nature of the income when filing your company’s annual Corporate Income
Tax Return (Form C) and tax computation.

[**\[NEW!\] Alternative Net Tonnage Basis of Taxation**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/specific-industries/shipping-companies#-new---alternative-net-tonnage-basis-of-taxation)

As announced in Budget 2024, to better align Singapore’s tax regime for shipping entities with common international practices, an alternative net tonnage basis of taxation (“NTT basis”) is available for shipping enterprises under Section 13A, approved international shipping enterprises under Section 13E and approved shipping investment enterprises under Section 13P with effect from Year of Assessment (YA) 2024.

The NTT basis is not a separate tax regime but an alternative way of computing the income tax base of a qualifying shipping entity and subjecting that income tax base to the prevailing corporate income tax.

A qualifying shipping entity that makes an election for the NTT basis will apply the NTT basis to all qualifying ships owned/ operated by the entity. The entity’s income tax base for a YA is the total sum of the income for each qualifying ship computed by reference to the net tonnage of that ship, a deemed daily income per net ton and the number of days that the ship was in operation during the basis period of a YA. The election, once made, is irrevocable.

In computing the corporate income tax payable under the NTT basis, a qualifying shipping entity should note the following:

- partial tax exemption, tax exemption for new start-up companies, and deductions do not apply to the income computed under the NTT basis
- any unutilised capital allowances, trade losses and donations (i.e. unutilised items) cannot be deducted against the income computed under the NTT basis
- the entity is not eligible to claim carry-back of capital allowances and losses or group relief against the income computed under the NTT basis
- where applicable, foreign tax credit can be claimed subject to the entity meeting all qualifying conditions under existing tax rules, and the terms and conditions of the relevant double taxation agreement in the case of claims for double tax relief
- corporate income tax rebate, if any, is applicable for that YA.

For entities that do not elect for the NTT basis, the existing tax exemption under the relevant shipping incentives continues to apply.

[**FAQs**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/specific-industries/shipping-companies#faqs)

1. **The principal activities of Company A are that of ship owner and operator. Company A derives charter income from the chartering out of Singapore-registered ships. It receives a compensation sum from a customer for early termination of the charter-out contract. Is the compensation receipt exempted from tax under Section 13A of the Income Tax Act 1947?**

The compensation receipt qualifies for tax exemption under Section 13A of the Income Tax Act 1947 if it is to compensate Company A for the loss of future charter income, which it is expected to earn if not for the early termination. This is subject
    to the following conditions:

1. The vessel chartered out is used by Company A to derive income that qualifies for tax exemption under Section 13A of the Income Tax Act 1947 immediately prior to the termination of the charter-out contract;
2. The compensation sum is provided for under the charter-out contract; and
3. The compensation amount is determined with reference to the estimated income loss for Company A from the early termination of the charter-out contract. It is computed based on the difference between the charter hire rate per the charter-out
       contract and the prevailing market charter hire rate at the early termination date over the remainder of the charter period.
2. **Company B is an AISE. It receives a compensation sum from a customer for early termination of the charter out of a foreign ship. Is the compensation receipt exempted from tax under Section 13E of the Income Tax Act 1947?**

The compensation receipt qualifies for tax exemption under Section 13E of the Income Tax Act 1947 if it is to compensate Company B for the loss of future charter income, which it is expected to earn if not for the early termination. This is subject
    to the following conditions:

1. Company B is an AISE at the point of early termination of the charter-out contract;
2. The vessel chartered out is used by Company B to derive income that qualifies for tax exemption under Section 13E of the Income Tax Act 1947 immediately prior to the termination of the charter-out contract;
3. The compensation sum is provided for under the charter-out contract; and
4. The compensation amount is determined with reference to the estimated income loss for Company B from the early termination of the charter-out contract. It is computed based on the difference between the charter hire rate as per the charter-out
       contract and the prevailing market charter hire rate at the early termination date over the remainder of the charter period.

[**Where Both Exempt & Non-Exempt Income is Derived**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/specific-industries/shipping-companies#where-both-exempt---non-exempt-income-is-derived)

### Common Expenses

Where both exempt and non-exempt income are derived, your company should allocate, on a reasonable basis, the common expenses (usually administrative expenses) that cannot be directly identified to each ship. Normally, the turnover basis is used. The share
of common expenses allocated to exempt income is to be deducted against exempt income.

### Capital Allowance Claims

Where your shipping company derives both exempt and non-exempt income, capital allowance claims on common assets should be apportioned to income derived from different tax categories using an appropriate basis (e.g. turnover basis).

If the fixed assets are directly identifiable to a particular exempt or non-exempt income source, the capital allowances for such assets must be deducted against that respective source of income. For instance, capital allowances on a Singapore registered
ship plying in international waters can be claimed only against Section 13A exempt shipping income.

Your shipping company can choose not to claim capital allowances for the portion that is attributed to its exempt income under Section 13A. However, it is mandatory for your shipping company to claim capital allowances against its shipping income exempted
under Section 13E.

Where your shipping company claims capital allowances against the exempt income under Section 13A for the current Year of Assessment (YA), the unutilised balance of such allowances, if any, cannot be set-off against any other income or be carried forward.

#### Application of Section 13A(11) when a ship ceases to be a Singapore ship (a ship registered with the Singapore Registry of Ships)

Your shipping enterprise enjoys tax exemption on income derived from the operation of Singapore ships outside the limits of the port of Singapore under Section 13A of the Income Tax Act 1947.

During the tax-exempt period, it is not mandatory for your shipping enterprise to claim capital allowances on the ship and other assets used in the shipping operation. However, when such ship ceases to be a Singapore ship, Section 13A(11) provides
for the capital allowances to be computed on the Residue of Expenditure (RoE) of the assets.

RoE is the notional tax written down value of the assets after taking into account the capital allowances for those YAs during which income derived from the operation of the Singapore ship was exempt from tax, notwithstanding that no claim for such
allowances was made.

In _GCN v CIT \[2020\] SGITBR 2,_ the Income Tax Board of Review ruled that all capital allowances (both initial **and** annual allowances under Section 19) should
be taken into account in computing the RoE.

##### Example: RoE Computation of a Singapore Ship

A ship at the cost of $1 million was registered as a Singapore ship from 1 Jan 2020 to 30 Jun 2022. It ceased to be a Singapore ship on 1 Jul 2022. The shipping enterprise has a Dec year-end and did not make any claim for capital allowances in YAs
2021 and 2022.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cost of Ship |  | $1,000,000 |
| Less: YA 2021 |  |  |
| Initial Allowance (20% x $1,000,000) | $(200,000) |  |
| Annual Allowance (80% x $1,000,000/ 16 years) | $(50,000) |  |
| Notional Capital Allowance |  | $(250,000) |
| Tax Written Down Value as at 31 Dec 2020 |  | $750,000 |
| Less: YA 2022 |  |  |
| Initial Allowance | \- |  |
| Annual Allowance | $(50,000) |  |
| Notional Capital Allowance |  | $(50,000) |
| **Tax Written Down Value as at 31 Dec 2021** |  | **$700,000** |

For YA 2023, capital allowance for the ship is to be calculated based on the RoE of $700,000 and not on the original cost of the ship of $1,000,000, notwithstanding that no claim for such allowances was made by the shipping enterprise in YAs 2021 and 2022.

### Set-Off and Carry-Forward of Company Losses

When your company suffers losses from the portion of business qualifying for Section 13A exemption, that amount of losses cannot be set-off against non-exempt income.

The losses also cannot be carried forward to future years for set-off against future years' income.
