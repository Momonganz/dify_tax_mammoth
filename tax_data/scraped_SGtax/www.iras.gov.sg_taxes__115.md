### FAQs

[**Why is the $80,000 personal income tax relief cap introduced?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/tax-reliefs-rebates-and-deductions/tax-reliefs#why-is-the--80-000-personal-income-tax-relief-cap-introduced-)

There are currently 15 personal income tax reliefs and each relief serves a worthy objective. However, taken together, the tax reliefs can unduly reduce the total taxable income for a small proportion of individuals.

We need to moderate the effects of large amounts of reliefs claimed, in order to preserve equity in our tax structure. Hence, the personal income tax relief cap was introduced in Budget 2016. By limiting the reliefs an individual can claim to reduce the taxable income, the personal income tax system will be more progressive. The vast majority of taxpayers are unaffected by the relief cap.

[**What does the cap on personal income tax relief apply to?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/tax-reliefs-rebates-and-deductions/tax-reliefs#what-does-the-cap-on-personal-income-tax-relief-apply-to-)

The cap on personal income tax relief applies to the total amount of all tax reliefs claimed, which is effective from YA 2018.

[**How do I know if I am affected by the relief cap?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/tax-reliefs-rebates-and-deductions/tax-reliefs#how-do-i-know-if-i-am-affected-by-the-relief-cap-)

You will be affected by the relief cap if the total amount of personal reliefs claimed by you exceeds $80,000. The tax reliefs to be allowed to you will be capped at $80,000, which will be reflected in your Notice of Assessment.

To check if you will be affected by the relief cap, you can use the [income tax calculator for YA 2024](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/calculators).

[**With the relief cap, do I still claim all reliefs?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/tax-reliefs-rebates-and-deductions/tax-reliefs#with-the-relief-cap--do-i-still-claim-all-reliefs-)

Personal reliefs are granted based on claims made. You may continue to claim the personal reliefs, as long as you have satisfied the qualifying conditions of the respective reliefs.

Based on the claims made by you, if the total amount of personal reliefs exceeds the overall relief cap of $80,000, the personal reliefs allowed to you will be limited to $80,000.

[**The total WMCR which I can claim on my children are more than $80,000. Can I transfer the balance of my WMCR to my spouse?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/tax-reliefs-rebates-and-deductions/tax-reliefs#the-total-wmcr-which-i-can-claim-on-my-children-are-more-than--80-000--can-i-transfer-the-balance-of-my-wmcr-to-my-spouse-)

No. If the total amount of personal reliefs claimed by you exceeds the relief cap of $80,000, the personal reliefs allowed to you will be limited to $80,000. The balance of the reliefs which you have claimed will be disregarded and cannot be transferred.

When claiming reliefs, if you are aware that you have exceeded the relief cap, you may consider giving up certain reliefs (e.g. Qualifying Child Relief, Parent Relief and Grandparent Caregiver Relief) and let others (e.g. your spouse, your
siblings) claim the reliefs, provided that they satisfy the conditions for claiming those reliefs.

[**My siblings and I had previously agreed to share the Parent Relief on our parents equally. However, for YA 2024, the total amount of personal reliefs which I can claim is more than $80,000 even without the Parent Relief claim. Can I give my share of the Parent Relief to my siblings?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/tax-reliefs-rebates-and-deductions/tax-reliefs#my-siblings-and-i-had-previously-agreed-to-share-the-parent-relief-on-our-parents-equally--however--for-ya-2024--the-total-amount-of-personal-reliefs-which-i-can-claim-is-more-than--80-000-even-without-the-parent-relief-claim--can-i-give-my-share-of-the-parent-relief-to-my-siblings-)

Personal reliefs are granted based on claims made. If you decide not to claim Parent Relief for YA 2024, you can inform your siblings so that they can claim your share of Parent Relief.

If you have claimed for your share of Parent Relief and realised that you have exceeded the relief cap after receiving the Notice of Assessment, you may [file an amendment online](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/login/selection "myTax Portal") to withdraw your claim for Parent Relief. Your siblings will also need to file amendments online to claim any additional share of Parent Relief based
on their revised agreement on how to share the Parent Relief.
