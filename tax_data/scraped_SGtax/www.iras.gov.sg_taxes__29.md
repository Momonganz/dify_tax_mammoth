We understand that paying taxes can be challenging during difficult times. If you are facing difficulties paying your tax, do reach out to us before the payment due date. We will work with you to come up with a suitable payment arrangement that takes into account your unique circumstances.

Do not ignore the tax bill or a demand for payment. Otherwise, a 5% late payment penalty will be imposed on the overdue tax.

## Extended GIRO Scheme for Residential Property (Retirees)

As announced in Budget 2024, you may be eligible for an extended instalment plan of up to 24 months for the payment of property tax for your residential property, provided you meet the following criteria:

- You are residing in the property (i.e. your property is taxed at the owner-occupier tax rates); and
- Your assessable income does not exceed $34,000 in YA2024; and
- All the owner(s) of the property, including yourself, are aged 65 or above in 2025; and
- There is outstanding property tax payable for the property.

Refer to the section below on arranging for a longer payment plan for the steps on how to apply for an extended instalment plan. You will be required to declare that you meet the above criteria in your application. Please note that your extended instalment plan will be reverted to the standard instalment plan of up to Dec 2025 if you are subsequently found to not have met the above criteria.

## For individuals or businesses in financial difficulties

IRAS may offer a suitable payment arrangement, such as a longer instalment plan, if you are unable to pay your tax due to unexpected or extenuating circumstances including:

- High medical expenses
- Loss of employment or substantial reduction in income
- Business under financial distress (e.g. facing lawsuits from creditors or business closure)

You may be required to submit documentary evidence to support your request for a longer instalment plan.
