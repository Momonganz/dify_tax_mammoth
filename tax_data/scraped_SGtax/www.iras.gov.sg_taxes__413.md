File Withholding Tax (WHT) via [mytax.iras.gov.sg](http://mytax.iras.gov.sg/) using Singpass and make payment to IRAS by the due date.


On this page:

To file WHT for your company or client, you must be authorised by your company or client in Corppass to access the digital services at [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ "https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/").

For assistance on Corppass setup, please refer to the relevant [Step-by-Step Guides](https://www.iras.gov.sg/digital-services/others/corppass "Step-by-Step Guides").

## Step 1 : Authorise Users for WHT filing

This step is required if you are filing WHT for the first time or there is a change in the person filing the WHT.

If you are an individual payer (i.e. NRIC or FIN holder without a registered business entity), you cannot authorise staff or third party to file WHT on your behalf.

If you are a liquidator filing WHT for a liquidated company, [view instructions](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/corppass-for-companies-under-liquidation-submitting-s45-withholding-tax.pdf?sfvrsn=55cb4a5f_2 "view instructions") (PDF, 2.11.MB) on how to authorize users for WHT filing.

### Staff/ third party filing for the organisation for the first time

The following steps must be done in Corppass by the Corppass Administrator (CPA)/ Sub-Admin of the company or partnership before the staff/ third party can file WHT:

1. Create Corppass user accounts for the persons transacting with IRAS
2. Assign the S45 Withholding Tax (Filing) digital service to the Corppass user account and select user’s role as either a Preparer or an Approver.






| Preparer | Approver |
| --- | --- |
| **Preparer** <br>Can complete the WHT filing and save it as a draft or submit to Approver.<br>There will be an acknowledgement page to show your submission to Approver is successful. | **Approver** <br>Can complete the WHT filing and save it as a draft or review the WHT filing completed by a Preparer. |
| **Preparer** <br>**Cannot submit** the WHT filing to IRAS.<br>Has to inform the Approver that the draft or submission is ready for review and approval before submission to IRAS. The Approver has to review and grant approval within 60 days, otherwise the above draft/submission will be deleted. | **Approver** <br>**Can submit the WHT filing to IRAS**. |

Users who are authorised with “access to all e-Services” during the Corppass set-up will be assigned the role as an Approver.

3. Assign the for Non-UEN only digital service to the Corppass accounts filing for a non-UEN entity (e.g. REIT).

## Step 2: File your WHT on mytax.iras.gov.sg

Use Singpass to log in to [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ "mytax.iras.gov.sg") for “Business Tax or Business Client”,
whichever is applicable, to file WHT for the company.

There are 2 ways to file WHT:

1. If you are filing a few records, you can file via S45 Online filing. View [S45 online filing guide](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/file-s45-form-via-online-e-filing-user-guide.pdf?sfvrsn=c1971e7f_12) (PDF, 1.12MB)
2.
