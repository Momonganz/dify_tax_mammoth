### When Grant of Representation is Not Required

For estates with simple asset structure at the time of death, the grant of representation may not be required. However, Estate Duty clearance is still required under certain circumstances.

**Examples**

1. Deceased transferred all assets as gifts to someone else and the total market value exceeds the exemption threshold of $600,000 as at the time of death.
2. Deceased passed away on or after 28 Feb 1996, where he or she only had bank accounts and dwelling house, both held in joint names with others. The total market value of the bank accounts exceeds $600,000 or the value of his or her share in the dwelling
    house exceeds $9 million as at his or her death.
3. The market value of contents in the safe deposit boxes exceeds $10,000 with the same bank.

The above examples are not exhaustive. There may be other cases where Estate Duty clearance is required even though the Grant of Representation is not obtained in Singapore.
