Under IGDS, approved GST-registered businesses pay GST on imports payments when their monthly GST returns are due instead of at the point of importation.

On this page:

## Purpose

Currently, GST on imported goods (import GST) is payable to Singapore Customs at the point of importation.

Under IGDS, approved GST-registered businesses can defer their import GST payments until their monthly GST returns are due.

IGDS aims to ease the import GST cash flow arising from the time lapse between the payment of import GST and the claiming of import GST for GST-registered businesses.

## Using IGDS

GST-registered businesses account for the deferred import GST and claim it as input tax (subject to the conditions of claiming input tax) in the same GST return.

**Businesses under IGDS must file their GST returns on monthly basis.** This allows importers to enjoy a credit period of one to two months, similar to what businesses enjoy for their local purchases (30-day credit term).

The following table illustrates how IGDS works:

| Date | Activity / Event |
| --- | --- |
| **Date** 1 Oct | **Activity / Event** Start of accounting period |
| **Date** 10 Oct | **Activity / Event** Import goods with import GST amounting to $10,000<br>**Under normal GST rules**<br>Pay import GST of $10,000 upfront to Singapore Customs<br>**Under IGDS**<br>Defer the payment of the import GST of $10,000 |
| **Date** 20 Oct | **Activity / Event** Supply of goods with output tax amounting to $15,000 |
| **Date** 31 Oct | **Activity / Event** End of the accounting period |
| **Date** 30 Nov | **Activity / Event** GST reporting and payment to IRAS<br>**Under normal GST rules**<br>Account output tax of $15,000 and claim input tax of $10,000.<br>Therefore, you pay IRAS $5,000 of GST<br>**Under IGDS**<br>Account for output tax of $15,000, deferred import GST of $10,000 and claim input tax of $10,000. Therefore, you pay IRAS $15,000 of GST |
