Under MES, GST on non-dutiable goods is suspended at the point of import and also when the goods are removed from Zero GST warehouses.

On this page:

## Purpose

Major Exporter Scheme (MES) is designed to **ease the cash flow** of businesses that import and export goods substantially.

Under normal rules, the businesses have to pay GST upfront on imports and subsequently obtain a refund from IRAS after submission of their GST returns.

This can create cash flow problems for businesses that export goods substantially as no GST is collected from the zero-rated supplies to set-off their initial cash outflow on imports.

Businesses granted the MES are able to **import non-dutiable goods with GST suspended**. Effective from 1 Jul 2006, such businesses also enjoy GST suspension on goods removed from a Zero GST warehouse.

## Using MES

MES is granted when you import goods under the following scenarios:

1. Import your **own goods** in the course or furtherance of your business;
2. Import goods belonging to your overseas principal for sale in Singapore or re-export on behalf of the overseas principal, in the course or furtherance of the business (i.e. you are acting as a [Section 33(2) agent](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/importing-of-goods));
3. Import goods belonging to your overseas principal which will later be re-exported (e.g. back to your overseas principal) if the requirements for section 33A agent in the [GST: Guide on Imports](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide_gst_guide-on-imports.pdf?sfvrsn=3208f1ab_72 "GST: Guide on Imports") (PDF, 382KB) are satisfied; or
4. (From 1 Jan 2015) Re-import goods which you previously sent abroad for value-added activities, belonging to your local customer or GST-registered overseas customer if the requirements under section 33B explained in [GST: Claiming of GST on re-import of value-added goods](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etax-guide_claiming-of-gst-on-re-import-of-value-added-goods_third-edition.pdf?sfvrsn=a52d4f62_14 "GST: Claiming of GST on re-import of value-added goods") (PDF, 565KB) are satisfied.

### For (2) and (3) above, you must ensure that:

1. Your overseas principal is not registered for GST;
2. You keep separate records for goods belonging to your overseas principal;
3. You have control over the custody and possession of the goods owned by your overseas principals at all times; and
4. You treat any subsequent supply of goods as being made by you:
1. When you sell the goods locally, you should standard-rate the supply; and

2. When you export the goods and maintain the required export evidence, you may zero-rate the supply.

      For the types of export evidence to maintain under each export scenario, refer to [GST: Guide on Exports](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguides_gst_exports_2013-12-31(1).pdf?sfvrsn=ecabfc4b_36 "GST: Guide on Exports") (PDF, 717KB) and [GST: Guide on Hand-Carried Exports Scheme](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide_gst_guide-on-hand-carried-exports-scheme_fb5a6034062a4f29b8b86305d062cebf.pdf?sfvrsn=9e702fa2_76) (PDF, 332KB).

New applications will still have a validity period of three years and their first renewal will be in the third year of the validity period.

## Appointing declaring agents

As an approved MES person, you are able to authorise up to 20 declaring agents (e.g. freight forwarders) to clear the goods on your behalf.

You are accountable for all permits declared by your declaring agents. Therefore, we advise that you exercise due care and do not appoint more declaring agents than necessary.

To appoint/change/delete agents, use the online e-Service "Apply for Declaring Agents" at [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/login/selection "mytax.iras.gov.sg").
Your request will be effected in the next two working days.

## Reporting in GST returns

### 1\. Importing goods

When you import goods (including goods belonging to your overseas principals who are not GST-registered) under MES, you should declare the value of imports in:

1. Box 5 (Total value of taxable purchases); and
2. Box 9 (Total value of goods imported under Major Exporter Scheme/ Approved 3rd Party Logistics Company Scheme or Other Approved Schemes).

Declarations must be supported by valid ME permits and relevant supporting documents (e.g. commercial invoices and appropriate shipping documents).

As GST on imports has been suspended (i.e. not paid), you should not claim any input tax.

### 2\. Zero-GST (ZG) warehouses

When you import goods (including goods belonging to your overseas principal) into a  [Zero GST (ZG) warehouse](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/zero-gst-warehouse-scheme "Zero GST (ZG) Warehouse"),
you must declare the imports in your GST return despite the suspension of GST.

You should declare the value of imports in Box 5 (Total value of taxable purchases) even though GST is suspended.

When the goods are later removed from ZG warehouse into customs territory under MES,  you should declare the value of goods removed in:

1. Box 5 (Total value of taxable purchases); and
2. Box 9 (Total value of goods imported under Major Exporter Scheme/ Approved 3rd Party Logistics Company Scheme or Other Approved Schemes).

They must be supported by valid ME / MC / Customs permits and relevant supporting documents (e.g. commercial invoices and appropriate shipping documents).

## Easing compliance

The [TradeXchange Repository Service](https://www.ntp.gov.sg/home/ "TradeXchange Repository Service") provides an online platform for the consolidation of relevant trade documents,
to help businesses meet the recordkeeping requirements for imports and exports with greater ease. Uploading documents on this platform reduces the efforts in manually matching your permits with other documents in support of your trade activities.

No. You can only use your MES status for goods that are owned by you or your overseas principal (where you act as a [Section 33(2) agent](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/importing-of-goods),
Section 33A agent or Section 33B agent).

It is an offence for a non-MES company to import goods using the MES status of another company. Penalties will be imposed and your MES status may be revoked.

No. When your letter of guarantee expires (i.e. end of the guarantee period), the letter of guarantee is effectively null and void. Thus, the Comptroller **does not return the letter** nor issue a letter of release.

During the renewal of your MES status, the requirement of a letter of guarantee is also reviewed. You will be informed if a new letter of guarantee is required.
