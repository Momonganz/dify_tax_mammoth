## Obtain Form T (for new estate or trust)

For a new estate or trust, the legal personal representative (LPR) or trustee has to provide information on the estate or trust via [FormSG to obtain a Tax Reference Number (Tax Ref No.)](https://go.gov.sg/requestformt).

You cannot file a Form T return without an assigned Tax Ref No.

## Submit Form T

If you have been issued with a Tax Ref No., you should receive a physical notification letter to inform you of the need to file Form T by **15 Mar** each year. If you do not receive the notification letter, you are still required to file the tax return.
