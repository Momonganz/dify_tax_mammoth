Basic checklist on keeping accounts, preparing statement of accounts and filing income tax for sole-proprietors and self-employed persons including freelancers, commission agents, taxi drivers, private-hire car drivers and hawkers.

On this page:

## 1\. Know your tax obligations

All self-employed persons must report the income earned from their business operations as business income, and not as salary. The business income is part of the total personal income which is taxed at [individual income tax rates](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/tax-residency-and-tax-rates/individual-income-tax-rates).

You are a self-employed person when you earn a living by carrying on a trade, business, profession or vocation. Generally, sole-proprietors and partners registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) are self-employed.

To check whether you are a self-employed person, please refer to [Am I a self-employed person](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/self-employed-and-partnerships/am-i-a-self-employed-person).

## 2\. Decide on the accounting period

Every year, you declare your business income for a specific accounting period. The accounting period is usually a 12-month period of trade for which you calculate your profits or losses.

You should decide on your accounting period when you first start your business. Most businesses choose accounting period that ends on 31 Dec each year. You may choose an accounting period that ends on any date.

## 3\. Keep proper records and accounts

You are required to keep **full and accurate records and accounts** of your business transactions from the start. These records and accounts must be supported with invoices, receipts, vouchers, and other documents.

IRAS will not accept estimate and improper records. For details, please refer to [Keeping proper records and accounts](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/self-employed-and-partnerships/keeping-proper-records-and-accounts).

## 4\. Prepare statement of accounts

At the end of every accounting period, you must prepare the statement of accounts comprising:

- Profit and Loss Account
- Balance Sheet

For details, please refer to [Preparing statement of accounts](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/self-employed-and-partnerships/calculating-my-business-income/preparing-statement-of-accounts).

## 5\. Prepare a 2-line / 4-line statement

From your statement of accounts, you have to extract the relevant figures and prepare a [2-line / 4-line statement](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/self-employed-and-partnerships/calculating-my-business-income/calculating-business-income#title4) for filing your Income Tax Return.

## 6\. File income tax

Whether you need to file your taxes depends on:

- whether you received a filing notification or tax return from IRAS. IRAS will send out notification to file or issue a paper Income Tax Return (Form B/B1) between January and mid-March each year;
- the type of notification you received; and
- how much income you earned in the preceding year.

## 7\. Pay withholding tax

When a non-resident person (including [partnership with 100% non-resident partners](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/self-employed-and-partnerships/tax-obligations-of-partnerships/withholding-tax)) derives income of a specified nature (e.g. interest, royalty, director fees, technical service fees, etc.) in Singapore, such income may be subjected to withholding tax in Singapore.

In this regard, when you made such payment to a non-resident person, you are required to:

1. Deduct the applicable withholding tax from the payment; and
2. e-File and pay the withholding tax to IRAS by 15th of the second month from the [date of payment](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/withholding-tax-filing/withholding-tax-filing-and-payment-due-date) to the non-resident.

The withholding tax rate varies according to the [type of payment](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/basics-of-withholding-tax/types-of-payment-and-withholding-tax-rates) made to the non-resident person.

You can use the [Basic Withholding Tax Applicability Calculator](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/basics-of-withholding-tax/overview-of-withholding-tax-(WHT)#title4) to determine if your payment made to the non-resident person is subject to withholding tax.

For more details, you can refer to [Withholding tax](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax).
