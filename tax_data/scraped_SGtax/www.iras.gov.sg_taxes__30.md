Self-employed persons are treated differently from employees when it comes to taxes. For instance, a self-employed person can claim trade losses against his trade income whereas an employee is not entitled to such claims.

Therefore, it is important to know if you are employed or self-employed for the purpose of tax.

On this page:

## Contract "of" or "for" service

You are employed or an employee if you perform work under a **contract of service** where you work under the control of your employer.

You are self-employed when you perform work for others (e.g. provide a service) under a **contract for service**.

As a self-employed with your own business, you work for yourself and you are in the position to realise a business profit or loss. Your income is derived from the buying and selling of goods, or from the provision of professional or personal services.

Self-employed person includes sole-proprietor or a partner in a partnership, but does not include director or shareholder of a private limited or limited company.

Self-employment income should be reported in the section ‘Trade, Business, Profession or Vocation’ of your Income Tax Return.

## Partners in a partnership

Partners who are registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) are generally regarded as **self-employed persons**.

Partners who are self-employed should report their share of profit/loss and remuneration (salary, bonus, CPF, and other benefits) from the partnership in the section **'** Trade, Business, Profession, or Vocation **'** > **'** Partnership **'** of the individual Income Tax Return (Form B/B1).

### Partners under employment contracts

There could be some cases where ACRA-registered partners are engaged under an employment contract with the partnership.

The partners generally do not assume the liabilities of the partnership and **do not have a share in the profit/loss** of the partnership. They will only receive remuneration (salary, bonus, CPF and other benefits) for the work they performed for the partnership.

In such cases, they are considered as **employees** of the partnership even though they have the title / designation of a 'partner'.

**Reporting of remuneration of partners engaged under employment contracts in the Form P**

The precedent partner should:

- declare the remuneration of these partners as an ‘Allowable Business Expenses’ in the partnership Income Tax Return (Form P);
- report their remuneration in the Form IR8A by 1 March; and
- transmit their employment income to IRAS electronically if the partnership is under the [Auto-Inclusion Scheme (AIS) for employment income](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/employers/auto-inclusion-scheme-(ais)-for-employment-income).

The precedent partner of the partnership should **not** report the remuneration of such partners in the section ‘Partnership Allocation’ > ‘Partner’s Salary, Bonus & CPF’ of the Form P.

**Reporting of remuneration by individual partners engaged under employment contracts in their** **Form B/B1**

The individual partners should declare their remuneration received from the partnership in the 'Employment' section of their individual Income Tax Return (Form B/B1) between 1 March and 18 April.

However, if the partnership is participating in the Auto-Inclusion Scheme (AIS) and will transmit employment income information to IRAS electronically, you do not need to declare your employment income in the Form B/B1. You only need to verify and ensure that your employment income is correctly auto-included in your Form B/B1 and clarify with your employer if otherwise. You can check if your organisation is in the AIS for employment income via the [Search AIS organisation e-services](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx?target=MeSubQueryEmployerSubStatusSearch).

hence, not taxable. However, it will be taxable if the activities are performed repeatedly or habitually in exchange for monetary or non-monetary benefits.

Examples of such non-taxable income includes:

- Token of appreciation monies received by grandparents for caring for their own grandchildren;
- Monies received for reimbursing the costs (e.g. transport trips, stationeries,
