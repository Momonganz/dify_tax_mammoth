## Supplies that span the change of GST rate

A supply spans the change of GST rate from 8% to 9% where one or two of the following events takes place wholly or partially on or after 1 Jan 2024:

(i)    the issuance of invoice;

(ii)   the receipt of payment (or the making of payment in respect of a reverse charge supply);

(iii)  the delivery of goods or performance of services (i.e. Basic Tax Point).

On this page:

[**Examples of supplies spanning the change of rate**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-rate-change/gst-rate-change-for-business/transitional-rules-for-gst-rate-change#examples-of-supplies-spanning-the-change-of-rate)

The following are examples of a supply that span the change of GST rate:

- You issue an invoice on your supply of goods to your customer in 2023, but you only receive full payment and deliver the goods after 1 Jan 2024.


- You issue an invoice on your supply of services to your customer after 1 Jan 2024, but you receive partial payment and perform a part of the services in 2023.

- As an RC business, you procure services from an overseas supplier where the invoice is issued and the services are performed in 2023, but you only make full payment after 1 Jan 2024.

The transitional rules outlined below apply for transactions which straddle the 2024 GST rate change from 8% to 9%.

For transactions which straddle the 2023 GST rate change from 7% to 8%, the transitional rules apply in the same way. Please refer to these examples for an [illustration](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/illustration-of-transitional-rules---7-to-8-(pdf).pdf?sfvrsn=d512fc46_11) on how the rules apply. For more information, please refer to the [e-Tax Guide: 2023 GST Rate Change: A Guide for GST-registered businesses](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide_2023-gst-rate-change---a-guide-for-gst-registered-businesses_1st-edition.pdf?sfvrsn=5224b08a_32).

For transactions which straddle both the 2023 GST rate change from 7% to 8% and the 2024 GST rate change from 8% to 9%, please refer to the [e-Tax Guide: 2024 GST Rate Change: A Guide for GST-registered businesses](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide_2024-gst-rate-change---a-guide-for-gst-registered-businesses_1st-edition.pdf?sfvrsn=f2821af9_21) for guidance and illustrations on how the transitional rules apply.

## If you are a local supplier or an overseas supplier registered under the Overseas Vendor Registration (OVR) regime for B2C supplies of digital services

The transitional rules apply when:

1.   You issue an invoice for your supply on or after 1 Jan 2024 and:

(a)  You do not receive full payment in 2023;

(b)  You have delivered or performed a part or all of the goods or services in 2023; and

(c)  You wish to elect to apply 8% GST on the extent of the value of goods delivered or services performed in 2023.

2.   You issue an invoice for your supply in 2023 and you receive full or part payment on or after 1 Jan 2024.

### 1\. Invoice is issued on or after 1 Jan 2024

If you issue an invoice for your supply on or after 1 Jan 2024 but you receive full payment in 2023, the supply is subject to 8% GST.

If you did not receive full payment in 2023 but have delivered or performed a part or all of the goods or services in 2023, you can elect to charge 8% GST on the higher of:

(a)   The payment received in 2023; or

(b)   The value of goods delivered or services performed in 2023.

The remaining value of the supply is subject to GST at 9%.

[**Example 1: Supply involving invoice issued after 1 Jan 2024**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-rate-change/gst-rate-change-for-business/transitional-rules-for-gst-rate-change#example-1--supply-involving-invoice-issued-after-1-jan-2024)

You deliver goods to your customer on 26 Dec 2023 when the GST rate is 8%. You issue a tax invoice dated 3 Jan 2024 for the sales of goods and you receive full payment from your customer on 10 Jan 2024.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Under the general time of supply rule, 9% GST is chargeable on the supply as the tax invoice is issued and full payment is received after the rate change. However, you can elect to charge 8% GST on the entire value of the supply as the goods are fully
delivered in 2023.

If you have already issued a tax invoice with 9% GST charged to your customer before you make the election, you will need to provide your customer with a credit note\* for the amount of GST overcharged by 15 Jan 2024. However, where you are unable to issue the credit note\* for the GST overcharged by 15 Jan 2024, the Comptroller will allow you up to 90 days after the issue of your original tax invoice to issue the credit note for ease of compliance.

You do not need to seek prior approval from IRAS when you make an election for your supply. However, you should maintain the documentary evidence to show that the goods are delivered before the rate change.

\*Note: Alternatively, you may also issue
a credit note to cancel the original tax invoice issued on 3 Jan 2024. At the same time, you must reissue a new tax invoice to charge GST at 8%. You will similarly have up to 90 days after the issue of your original tax invoice to issue the credit note/ new tax invoice.

For more information, please refer to the e-Tax Guide: [2024 GST Rate Change: A Guide for GST-registered businesses.](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide_2024-gst-rate-change---a-guide-for-gst-registered-businesses_1st-edition.pdf?sfvrsn=f2821af9_21)

### 2\. Invoice is issued in 2023

If you have received full payment in 2023, or if you have delivered all the goods or performed all the services in 2023, the entire value of the supply is subject to 8% GST.

In all other scenarios, 9% GST will apply on the lower of:

(a)   The payment received on or after 1 Jan 2024; or

(b)   The value of goods delivered or services performed on or after 1 Jan 2024.

[**Transactions to be adjusted**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-rate-change/gst-rate-change-for-business/transitional-rules-for-gst-rate-change#transactions-to-be-adjusted)

You have issued an invoice showing 8% GST in 2023 but you receive payment and deliver the goods / perform the services on or after 1 Jan 2024:

1. If the original invoice issued by you is a tax invoice, you should adjust the GST amount charged on the original tax invoice by issuing a credit note and a new tax invoice (showing 9% GST) to your customer by 15 Jan 2024\*.
2. If the original invoice issued by you is a non-tax invoice (e.g. receipt issued to your non-GST registered customer), you can adjust for the transaction based on your normal business practices.

\\* In recognition that some businesses may need more time to issue the credit notes and new tax invoices required to make the necessary GST adjustments, IRAS is prepared to allow businesses up to 31 Mar 2024 to do so, for ease of compliance. There is no need to seek approval from IRAS for this extension. For more information, please refer to the e-Tax Guide: [2024 GST Rate Change: A Guide for GST-registered businesses.](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide_2024-gst-rate-change---a-guide-for-gst-registered-businesses_1st-edition.pdf?sfvrsn=f2821af9_21)

[**When to account for the additional output tax**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-rate-change/gst-rate-change-for-business/transitional-rules-for-gst-rate-change#when-to-account-for-the-additional-output-tax)

You should account for the additional output tax on the part of supply that is subject to 9% GST at the earliest of the following events:

1. When the new invoice for the part of supply is issued;

2. When the payment for the part of supply is received; or

3. 15 Jan 2024\*.

\\* If you require more time to adjust your transactions (e.g. issue credit notes and new tax invoices), IRAS is prepared to allow you up to 31 Mar 2024 to do so. Correspondingly, you may account for the additional output tax based on the date of issue of the credit note and new tax invoice, and this should be no later than 31 Mar 2024. If the original invoice issued by you is a non-tax invoice (e.g. receipt issued to your non-GST registered customer) and it is part of your business practice to adjust your transactions by reissuing new receipts (e.g., to collect the additional 1% GST), you must also account for output tax latest by 31 Mar 2024.

[**Example 2: Supply involving invoice issued in 2023 – full payment received after 1 Jan 2024**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-rate-change/gst-rate-change-for-business/transitional-rules-for-gst-rate-change#example-2--supply-involving-invoice-issued-in-2023---full-payment-received-after-1-jan-2024)

On 14 Dec 2023, you issue a tax invoice for your supply of services (value of $1,000) and you receive the full payment on 4 Jan 2024. You perform part of the services (value of $200) before 1 Jan 2024 and the remaining part of the services (value of $800) after 1 Jan 2024.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Under the transitional rules, you are required to charge 9% GST on $800 of the supply (being the lower of the value of the payment received ($1,000) or services performed ($800) on or after the rate change date).

You should\* issue the following to your customer by 15 Jan 2024:

- a credit note for $864 ($800 plus 8% GST of $64); and
- a new tax invoice for $872 ($800 plus 9% GST of $72).


You should declare the credit note and new tax invoice in the GST accounting period in which they are issued as follows:

| Credit note adjustment | Issuance of new tax invoice | Net adjustment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reduce your value of standard-rated supplies by $800 | Increase your value of standard-rate supplies by $800 | - |
| Reduce your output tax by $64 | Increase your output tax by $72 | Increase your output tax by $8 |

\*Note: Alternatively, you may also issue a credit note to cancel the original tax invoice issued on 14 Dec 2023 charging GST at 8% and at the same time, issue new tax invoice(s) for the parts of the value of supply which are subject to GST at 8% and 9% respectively. For more information, please refer to the e-Tax Guide: [2024 GST Rate Change: A Guide for GST-registered businesses.](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide_2024-gst-rate-change---a-guide-for-gst-registered-businesses_1st-edition.pdf?sfvrsn=f2821af9_21)

[**Example 3: Supply involving invoice issued in 2023 – payments straddle 1 Jan 2024**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-rate-change/gst-rate-change-for-business/transitional-rules-for-gst-rate-change#example-3--supply-involving-invoice-issued-in-2023---payments-straddle-1-jan-2024)

On 14 Dec 2023, you issue a tax invoice for your supply of services (value of $1,000). Before 1 Jan 2024, you receive payment of $500 and perform part of the services (value of $200). After 1 Jan 2024, you receive the remaining payment of $500 and perform part of the services (value of $800).

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Under the transitional rules, you are required to charge 9% GST on $500 of the supply (being the lower of the value of the payment received ($500) or services performed ($800) on or after the rate change date).

You should issue the following to your customer by 15 Jan 2024:

• a credit note for $540 ($500 plus 8% GST of $40); and

• a new tax invoice for $545 ($500 plus 9% GST of $45).

You should declare the credit note and new tax invoice in the GST accounting period in which they are issued as follows:

| Credit note adjustment | Issuance of new tax invoice | Net adjustment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reduce your value of standard-rated supplies by $500 | Increase your value of standard-rate supplies by $500 | - |
| Reduce your output tax by $40 | Increase your output tax by $45 | Increase your output tax by $5 |

## If you are an overseas supplier registered under the OVR regime for supplies of B2C non-digital services (NDS) or low-value goods (LVG)

If you supply B2C non-digital services or LVG under the OVR regime from 1 Jan 2023 and your transaction straddles the 2024 GST rate change from 8% to 9%, the same transitional rules that apply on local sales also apply to your supplies where:

1.   You issue an invoice for your supply on or after 1 Jan 2024 and:

       (a)  You do not receive full payment in 2023;

       (b)  You have delivered or performed a part or all of the goods or services in 2023; and

       (c)  You wish to elect to apply 8% GST on the extent of the value of goods delivered or services performed in 2023.

2.   You
issue an invoice for your supply in 2023 and you receive full or part payment on or after 1 Jan 2024.


The examples below illustrate the application of the transitional rules to supplies of LVG/NDS which straddle 1 Jan 2024.

[**Example 4: Supply involving invoice issued in 2023**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-rate-change/gst-rate-change-for-business/transitional-rules-for-gst-rate-change#example-4--supply-involving-invoice-issued-in-2023)

(a) Supply of LVG

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Based on the time of supply rules, GST is chargeable at 8% when the invoice is issued on 15 Dec 2023. As payment is also received before 1 Jan 2024, GST remains chargeable at 8% on the full $1,000 even though goods are received by customer after 1 Jan 2024.

(b) Supply of non-digital services

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)Based on the time of supply rules, GST is chargeable at 8% when invoice is issued on 1 Sep 2023. However, as payment is not received and services are not performed before 1 Jan 2024, GST is chargeable at 9% on the entire value of the supply (i.e. $1,000). The additional 1% GST should be accounted for in the accounting period in which 6 Jan 2024 falls.

[**Example 5: Supply involving invoice issued on/ after 1 Jan 2024**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-rate-change/gst-rate-change-for-business/transitional-rules-for-gst-rate-change#example-5--supply-involving-invoice-issued-on--after-1-jan-2024)

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

An overseas supplier that is GST registered under the OVR regime enters into a contract in Aug 2023 to provide remote services to a non-registered person in Singapore as follows:

Value of supply performed in 2023: $200 (4 x $50)

Value of supply performed on/ after 1 Jan 2024: $800 (16 x $50)

Based on the time of supply rules, GST is chargeable as follows:

- 8% on payment of $100 received on 1 Sep 2023; and
- 9% on $900 when invoice issued/balance payment received on 10 Jan 2024

However, you may elect to charge GST at 8% on $200 which is the higher of services performed in 2023 (i.e. $200) and payment received in 2023 (i.e. $100). Since you would have already charged and accounted for GST at 8% on $100 when payment was received on 1 Sep 2023, you may elect to charge GST at 8% on an additional $100 out of the $900 when the invoice is issued/ balance payment received on 10 Jan 2024.

## If you are a Reverse Charge (RC) business

The transitional rules apply when you procure imported services and:

1. The invoice issued by your overseas supplier is on or after 1 Jan 2024 and you wish to elect to apply 8% GST on the extent of the value of services performed in 2023; or
2. The invoice issued by your overseas supplier is in 2023 and you make full or part payment on or after 1 Jan 2024.


### 1\. Invoice is issued on or after 1 Jan 2024

If the supplier’s invoice is issued on or after 1 Jan 2024 but you make full payment in 2023, the supply is subject to reverse charge at 8% GST.

If you do not make full payment in 2023 and a part or all of the services are performed before 1 Jan 2024, you can elect to account for GST on the supply at 8% on the higher of:

(a) The payment made in 2023; or

(b) The value of services performed in 2023.

The remaining value of the supply is subject to GST at 9%.

[**Example 6: RC transaction involving invoice issued after 1 Jan 2024**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-rate-change/gst-rate-change-for-business/transitional-rules-for-gst-rate-change#example-6--rc-transaction-involving-invoice-issued-after-1-jan-2024)

You procure imported services from your overseas supplier who performs the services on 21 Dec 2023 when the GST rate is 8%. The supplier’s invoice is issued on 11 Jan 2024 and you make the full payment on 23 Jan 2024.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)Under the general time of supply rule, the supply of imported services is subject to reverse charge at 9% GST as the invoice is issued and full payment is made after the rate change.

However, you can elect to account for GST at 8% on the entire value of the supply as the services are fully performed in 2023.

You do not need to seek prior approval from IRAS when you make an election for your reverse charge supply. Nevertheless, you should maintain the necessary documentary evidence and records to show that you have made the election and the services are performed before the rate change.

### 2\. Invoice is issued in 2023

If you have made full payment in 2023 or if the services are fully performed in 2023, the entire value of the supply is subject to reverse charge at 8% GST.

In all other scenarios, 9% GST will apply on the lower of:

(a) The payment made on or after 1 Jan 2024; or

(b) The value of services performed on or after 1 Jan 2024.

You should account for the additional output tax on the part of supply that is subject to reverse charge at 9% GST at the earlier of:

1\. When the payment for the part of supply is made; or

2\. 15 Jan 2024.

If you have elected to apply
reverse charge at the end of the longer period, the time to account for output tax depends on when the longer period takes place. Please refer to the e-Tax Guide [2024 GST Rate Change: A Guide for GST-registered Businesses](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide_2024-gst-rate-change---a-guide-for-gst-registered-businesses_1st-edition.pdf?sfvrsn=f2821af9_21) for more information.

You procure imported services (value of $1,000) from your overseas supplier who issues the invoice on 3 Dec 2023 and performs part of the services (value of $300) on 15 Dec 2023. You make full payment for the supply on 5 Jan 2024.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Under the general time of supply rule for RC transactions, you should account for GST at 8% on $1,000 in the GST accounting period in which 3 Dec 2023 falls, i.e., the date when the supplier's invoice is issued.

Under the transitional rules,
you are required to account for GST at 9% on $700 of the supply (being the lower of the value of the payment made ($1,000) or services performed ($700) on or after the rate change date). You should account for the additional GST of $7 ($700 x 1%) in the
GST accounting period in which 5 Jan 2024 falls.


###### If you account for GST on RC transactions based on the posting date

If you have been accounting for GST on your RC transactions based on the earlier of posting date or date of payment made, the transitional rules for rate change will depend on the posting date (instead of the invoice date). Please refer to the e-Tax Guide: [2024 GST Rate Change: A Guide for GST-registered Businesses](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide_2024-gst-rate-change---a-guide-for-gst-registered-businesses_1st-edition.pdf?sfvrsn=f2821af9_21) for more information on how the transitional rules will apply to such transactions.
