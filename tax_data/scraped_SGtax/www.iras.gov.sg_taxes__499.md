## Tax treatment of business income

Business income is income derived from carrying on a trade, business, profession, or a vocation.

Business income is taxable in the sole-proprietor's, partner's, or self-employed person's name. The sole-proprietor, partner, or self-employed person who receives this income has to report the income in his/her individual Income Tax Return (Form B/B1).

The business income is added to your other sources of personal income. The total amount is then subject to [individual income tax rates](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/tax-residency-and-tax-rates/individual-income-tax-rates "individual income tax rates").

## Reporting for self-employed partners

Self-employed partners are required to report in the individual Income Tax Return (Form B/B1) their:

1. Share of partnership profit/loss; and
2. Salary, bonus, CPF, and other benefits from the partnership.

Please check with your precedent partner on your share of income from the partnership.

If the partnership e-files the Form P by 28 Feb, the partnership allocation will be pre-filled in the respective partners' Income Tax Return. With this pre-filling initiative, the precedent partner need not separately inform the respective partners of their share of the partnership income.

The respective partners will only need to verify the pre-filled income from 1 Mar onwards and submit their individual Income Tax Return (Form B/B1) by the due date.

To determine if you are a partner that is employed or self-employed, please refer to [Am I a self-employed person](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/self-employed-and-partnerships/am-i-a-self-employed-person "Am I a self-employed person?").

Not declaring or under-declaring your partnership income is an omission which may render you liable for penalties under the law.
