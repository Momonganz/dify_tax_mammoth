## Reimbursements for Medical and Dental Care

### Scope of Administrative Concession

Reimbursements for medical and dental care treatment including traditional Chinese medicine treatment are not taxable.

Reimbursements for purchase of health supplements, contact lens and eyeglasses are taxable as they are not covered under the administrative concession.

### General Practitioner (GP) vs. Specialist Medical Bills

There is no difference in the tax treatment for GP bills from specialist medical bills. If both benefits are available to all employees,the reimbursement for both types of bills are not taxable.

### Reimbursements Based on Employee's Grade

Applying different thresholds for staff of different grades does not affect the tax treatment. The different amounts of reimbursements on the same benefit (e.g. hospitalisation)  are not taxable.

### Medical or Dental Benefits under Flexible Benefits Scheme

Offering medical and dental benefits under the flexible benefits scheme (also known as cafeteria benefits) does not change the tax treatment of the benefits. For details, please refer to [Flexible Benefits Scheme](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/employers/understanding-the-tax-treatment/tax-principles-and-flexible-benefits "flexible benefits scheme").

### Ceiling or Cap on Reimbursements

There is no threshold or cap on the amount/value of reimbursement for medical or dental care.
