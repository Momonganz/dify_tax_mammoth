- Automatic Tax Refunds and Interest

IRAS will automatically refund tax credits and pay interest on credits that were not refunded within 30 days from the date the tax credit arises. This excludes situations [when automatic tax refunds will not be made](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/refunds#title3 "circumstances where automatic refund of tax credits will not be made").

- Refund Modes

Tax credits are refunded through various methods including GIRO, PayNow or Telegraphic Transfer.
For further details, please refer to ' [Modes of Tax refunds](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/refunds#title2 "Modes of Tax refunds")'.

On this page:

In line with the nationwide push for cheque-free transactions, IRAS is transitioning to chequeless processes to promote electronic tax refunds. PayNow has been introduced as an additional refund mode for Individual Income Tax (IIT), Property Tax (PT), Corporate Income Tax (CIT), and Goods & Services Tax (GST).

As of 3 Jan 2022, IRAS has ceased issuing cheques for CIT and GST refunds. Furthermore, starting from 12 Aug 2024, cheques for IIT and PT refunds will no longer be issued, and refunds will be processed electronically via GIRO or PayNow.

To ensure receipt of IIT and PT refunds, individuals not on GIRO should register for GIRO or link their NRIC/FIN to their personal bank account to receive their refunds. Similarly, companies/organisations should sign up for GIRO or PayNow Corporate with their business/organisation's bank account to receive CIT and GST refunds.

## Foreigners or companies departing from Singapore and anticipating tax refunds (where applicable)

If you are a foreigner planning to leave Singapore after working in Singapore, or if your company is ceasing operations in Singapore, you should determine if you are expecting any tax refunds. If so, to ensure the successful receipt of your tax refunds, you should:

**Maintain a local bank account and register for PayNow FIN/UEN**

Ensure that you maintain an active local bank account in Singapore. Register for PayNow by linking your local bank account to your FIN/UEN, allowing for a seamless receipt of tax refunds. This will enable IRAS to directly deposit any tax refunds into your account, providing a convenient and efficient way to receive your refunds, without the need to incur additional cost.

## Checking for Tax Credits and Unclaimed Monies

You may log in to [_myTax Portal_](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/login/selection "myTax Portal") and
select "View Account Summary" under 'Account' to check if you have any tax credits.

At times, IRAS’ attempt to refund your tax credits may be unsuccessful e.g. you have closed your local bank account registered with PayNow FIN or your mailing address is not updated in our records. In such cases, any tax credit which IRAS is unable to refund to you will be categorised as [unclaimed monies](https://www.unclaimedmonies.gov.sg/). Please reach out to IRAS to claim them.

## Modes of Tax refunds

You can receive faster tax refunds (within 7 days from the date the credit arises) if you are paying your taxes via GIRO or have signed up for PayNow-NRIC/FIN/UEN.

## Interest on Late Tax Refunds

The interest rate adopted is Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA). This interest rate is subject to review and determined by the Ministry of Finance.

### **Circumstances where interest is payable on Tax Refunds (All Taxes except GST Refunds Arising from Input Tax Exceeding Output Tax)**

IRAS will pay you interest if the refund is not processed within 30 days from the date the tax credit arises or from the date when IRAS receives the required information/documents, whichever is later. This excludes [situations where tax credits will not be refunded automatically](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/refunds#title3).

For instance, if you have not set up GIRO with IRAS or registered for PayNow-NRIC/FIN with your respective bank to receive IIT or PT refunds at the time when the tax credit arises, IRAS will not pay you interest if the refund is not processed within 30 days from the date the tax credit arises. This also applies to foreigners who are leaving Singapore after working in Singapore and companies ceasing operations in Singapore. Further examples are available below.

[**Example: Late Refund of Tax Credit**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/refunds#example--late-refund-of-tax-credit)

You have a GIRO arrangement with IRAS.

Your tax assessment was finalised on 15 Jul and you have a tax credit of $5,000 to be refunded. IRAS is considered to be late if the tax refund is not made by 14 Aug.

If the tax credit is refunded on 30 Aug, interest will be paid on the principal sum of $5,000 for the period 15 - 30 Aug (16 days) as follows:

$5,000 x 4.7% x 16/365 = $10.30

IRAS will refund $5,000 together with the late tax refund interest of $10.30.

### **Circumstances where interest is payable on Tax Refunds (GST) Refunds Arising from Input Tax Exceeding Output Tax**

The tax refund due date for GST is 1 month and 3 months (after the date IRAS receives the GST returns) for monthly and quarterly prescribed accounting periods, respectively. Generally, IRAS will pay interest when the GST refund is not made by the due
date unless:-

- you have outstanding GST returns not filed;
- you are under audit by the Comptroller of GST and have not complied with his requests for information; or
- you have outstanding taxes or penalties.

Regardless of your filing frequency, the Comptroller of GST will pay interest if all 3 conditions are met:

1. The tax refund is not made within 3 months after you have filed the outstanding GST return(s)
2. You have provided the requested information to the Comptroller of GST
3. You have paid any outstanding taxes and penalties

However, if the Comptroller of GST reasonably suspicion that your tax refunds are part of a fraud arrangement (for example a [Missing Trader Fraud](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/getting-it-right/gst-audits-by-iras/current-area-of-focus-for-audits) arrangement), you will be notified about
the temporary withholding of GST refunds.

Your GST refunds will be withheld until the Comptroller of GST is confident that there is no such arrangement. In this case, the Comptroller will pay you interest if the tax refund is not made within one month after the day that the Comptroller of GST confirms that
you are entitled to the input tax claims.

[**Example 1: Late Tax Refund of GST Filed Monthly**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/refunds#example-1--late-tax-refund-of-gst-filed-monthly)

You have registered PayNow Corporate.

IRAS receives the GST return for the month of June on 15 Jul and you have a tax credit of $5,000 to be refunded. IRAS is considered to be late if the tax refund is not made by 15 Aug.

If the tax credit is refunded on 30 Aug, interest will be paid on the principal sum of $5,000 for the period 16 - 30 Aug (15 days) as follows:

$5,000 x 4.7% x 15/365 = $9.66

IRAS will refund $5,000 together with the late tax refund interest of $9.66.

[**Example 2: Late Tax Refund of GST Filed Quarterly**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/refunds#example-2--late-tax-refund-of-gst-filed-quarterly)

You have a GIRO arrangement with IRAS.

IRAS receives the GST return for the period Apr - Jun on 31 Jul with a GST refund claim of $80,000. IRAS is considered to be late if the tax refund is not made by 31 Oct.

If the tax credit is refunded on 3 Nov, interest will be paid on the principal sum of $80,000 for the period 1 - 3 Nov (three days) as follows:

$80,000 x 4.7% x 3/365 = $30.90

IRAS will refund $80,000 together with the late tax refund interest of $30.90.

[**Example 3: Where Comptroller of GST Requests for Information**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/refunds#example-3--where-comptroller-of-gst-requests-for-information)

The following example applies only for tax refund claims submitted on or after 1 Jan 2012.

IRAS receives the GST return for the period Jan - Mar on 30 Apr with a GST refund claim of $40,000. IRAS requests information during an audit on your tax refund claim. You reply to us with the full information on 1 Jun. You have a GIRO arrangement
with IRAS.

IRAS is considered to be late if the tax refund is not made by 1 Sep. If IRAS refunds the $40,000 on 4 Sep, interest will be paid on the principal sum of $40,000 for the period 2 - 4 Sep (three days) as follows:

$40,000 x 4.7% x 3/365 = $15.45

IRAS will refund $40,000 together with the late tax refund interest of $15.45.

[**Example 4: When the Comptroller of GST reasonably suspects that the tax refunds relate to any input tax on any supply made to you which was a part of a Missing Trader Fraud arrangement**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/refunds#example-4--when-the-comptroller-of-gst-reasonably-suspects-that-the-tax-refunds-relate-to-any-input-tax-on-any-supply-made-to-you-which-was-a-part-of-a-missing-trader-fraud-arrangement)

IRAS receives the GST return for the period Jan - Mar on 30 Apr with a GST refund claim of $65,000. You reply to us with full information on 1 Jun. You have a GIRO arrangement with IRAS.

Normally, IRAS is considered to be late if the tax refund is not made by 1 Sep, since you have complied with IRAS’ request for information.

However, as IRAS reasonably suspects that the underlying purchase for which you are claiming input tax was a part of a Missing Trader Fraud arrangement, no late interest is payable even if the tax refund is not made by 1 Sep. A notification letter will
be issued to inform you of the retention of GST refunds by the Comptroller of GST.
