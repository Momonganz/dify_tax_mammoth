How to update IRAS when there is a change in your residential, company or other mailing address.

On this page:

## Update Residential Address

For individual property owners, IRAS sends the property tax bills/notices/correspondences to the **residential mailing address** stated in the property owner's identity card.

**When you relocate, update your new residential address in your identity card via the [e-Service](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/ecoa "e-Service") with the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA).**

Once the address is updated, IRAS will automatically send bills/notices/correspondences to the new address. You do not have to notify IRAS separately once you have updated your identify card with ICA.

## Update Company Address

For corporate property owners, IRAS sends the property tax bill/notice/correspondence to the registered office address stated in the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) record.

**When companies relocate, they must update ACRA.**

Once the address is updated with ACRA, IRAS will automatically send property bills/notices/correspondences to the new address. You do not have to notify IRAS separately once you have updated ACRA.

## Update/Change to Other Mailing Address

To receive property tax bills/notices/correspondences at an address other than your residential or corporate address, you must provide IRAS with the mailing address by following the steps:

1. Log in to [myTax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ "myTax.iras.gov.sg").
2. At the top menu, Select ['Inbox (myTax Mail)'](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/portal/correspondence/mytax-mail).
