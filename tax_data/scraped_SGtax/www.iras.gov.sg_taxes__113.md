To claim exemptions under tax treaties such as Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs), non-resident professionals must meet the qualifying conditions.

On this page:

## Qualifying for Tax Treaty Exemption

The non-resident professional must meet the qualifying conditions under the [tax treaty](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/international-tax "tax treaty").

Please use our [DTA Calculator](https://www.iras.gov.sg/docs/default-source/individual-income-tax/non-residents/dta-calculator-for-nrp.xls?sfvrsn=f32d2058_9) (323KB) to check if the non-resident professional is eligible
for tax treaty exemption.

Use the DTA Calculator for current engagements. For prior years, please [email us](https://www.iras.gov.sg/contact-us/individual-income-tax#title4).

## Tax Treaty Exemption is Applicable

Where the 'Result' in the calculator shows that the tax treaty exemption applies, **Form IR586** will be displayed for completion by the non-resident professional.

The non-resident professional has to:

(a) complete the form;

(b) print and give it to the payer to support his claim for tax treaty exemption.

The payer has to claim the tax treaty exemption on behalf of the non-resident professional when e-filing the [withholding tax](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/withholding-tax-filing/withholding-tax-filing-and-payment-due-date "withholding tax"). The Form IR586 need not be submitted unless it is requested for verification.

## Tax Treaty Exemption is Not Applicable

Where tax treaty exemption does not apply, payers should e-file the [withholding tax](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/withholding-tax-filing/withholding-tax-filing-and-payment-due-date "withholding tax") and remit the tax withheld to IRAS.
