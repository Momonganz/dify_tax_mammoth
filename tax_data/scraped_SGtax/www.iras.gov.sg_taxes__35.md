# Note:

(i) To ensure that the requested information may be provided in a timely manner, please make the request using the EOI Form which is available at [https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/international-tax/international-tax-agreements-concludedby-singapore/exchange-of-information-arrangements/view-administration-of-theexchange-of-information-for-tax-purposes](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/international-tax/international-tax-agreements-concludedby-singapore/exchange-of-information-arrangements/view-administration-of-theexchange-of-information-for-tax-purposes) .

Correspondences on EOIR and SEOI may be sent to [eoi@iras.gov.sg](mailto:eoi@iras.gov.sg) or via the OECD’s Common Transmission System.

(ii) With the amendment of our laws to lift domestic tax interest requirement and remove restrictions on access to information held by banks and trust companies with effect from 28 November 2013, Singapore is able to render EOI assistance in accordance with the internationally agreed standard for EOI (“the Standard”), subject to reciprocity, even if the EOI Article in Singapore’s tax treaty does not contain Articles 26(4) and 26(5) of the OECD Model Tax Convention (MTC).

Where the EOI Article in Singapore’s tax treaty provides for EOI that is “necessary” for carrying out the provisions of the tax treaty, Singapore interprets “necessary” in a manner that will allow for EOI that is in line with the term “foreseeably relevant” as provided in the Standard. In addition, Singapore takes the interpretation that EOI will be in respect of all persons and will not be restricted by Article 1 (Persons Covered) of the OECD MTC even if the EOI Article in Singapore’s tax treaty does not explicitly provide that EOI is not restricted by Article 1.

(iii) Information relating to business entities registered in Singapore (e.g. entity name, registration number, entity status, and the principal activities of the entity) can be accessed by the public for free at the website of the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) at [https://go.gov.sg/acra-businessprofilereport](https://go.gov.sg/acra-businessprofilereport). For more information on the position holders, shareholders or partners of a particular business entity, the Business Profile report could be purchased at a prescribed fee (click on the button that states “Business Profile” and follow the steps shown on-screen). Users can verify the authenticity of the Business Profile at [https://www.acratrustbar.gov.sg/verify](https://www.acratrustbar.gov.sg/verify) .
