Goods and services given free to employees as part of their overall remuneration package are known as fringe benefits. The GST treatment for fringe benefits is explained in the following paragraphs.

On this page:

## Claiming input tax

You can claim the GST incurred on fringe benefits if the benefits are incurred for the purpose of your business. As all fringe benefits contain elements of personal consumption on which GST should be levied, fringe benefits are incurred for the purpose
of your business only if they have a close nexus to your business activities.

In addition, the benefits must not be:

1. A
    [non-claimable item](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/conditions-for-claiming-input-tax "non-claimable item") listed under Regulations 26 and 27 of the GST (General) Regulations
    ; or
2. Given only to the Sole Proprietor, Partners or Directors of the company. The GST incurred on such expenses is not claimable.

## Accounting for output tax

You may be required to account for output tax on fringe benefits if you have claimed input tax on the acquisition of the fringe benefits.

### Provision of free services to employees

The provision of free services is **not subject to GST**. For example, you need not account for output tax when you allow your employees to use the office telephone to make personal calls.

### Business goods given free to employees

You need to account for output tax on the goods given to your employees except when:

1. It relates to food or beverage catered for employees;
2. The cost of the gift is not more than $200 (amount exclusive of GST); or
3. No credit for input tax has been allowed on the purchase or import of those gifts.

[**Example: Gifts purchased from non-GST registered suppliers**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/common-scenarios---do-i-claim-gst/employee-benefits#example--gifts-purchased-from-non-gst-registered-suppliers)

You purchased the gifts from a non-GST registered supplier. There is no need to account for output tax since no input tax was incurred.

Please note that when GST on goods has been suspended when you first purchase or import them (e.g. the goods were imported under the Major Exporter Scheme), the GST suspended is treated as input tax allowed to you.

### Business goods for the temporary use of your employees

You need to account for output tax when you let your employees temporarily use your business goods for free except when:

1. It relates to the provision of accommodation in a hotel, inn, boarding house or similar establishment;
2. No credit for input tax has been allowed on the purchase or import of those goods;
3. The use of your business assets by your employee has a close nexus to your business activities

[**Example: Business goods used by employee**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/common-scenarios---do-i-claim-gst/employee-benefits#example--business-goods-used-by-employee)

You purchased a motorcycle to be used for your company deliveries and claimed the input tax incurred on the purchase. Your employees are allowed to use the motorcycle for free on weekends to run their personal errands. You will need to account for output tax on the portion of personal use.
