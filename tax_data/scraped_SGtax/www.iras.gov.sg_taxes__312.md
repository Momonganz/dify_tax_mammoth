(PDF, 499KB) and is capable of transmitting data to Central Clearing House.

### Filing GST returns

## Issuing eTRS transactions to tourists

1. Verify that the tourist is eligible
When tourist requests for a GST refund on their purchases, you must check the passport of the tourist and their electronic Visit Pass (e-Visit Pass) issued by Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to ensure that the tourist is eligible for GST refund under the Tourist Refund Scheme. A photocopy or an image of the passport is not acceptable.

2. Check departure method
You should also check with the tourist to ensure that they are departing from Singapore by air within 2 months from the date of purchase.

3. Explain the refund claim process
If the tourist is eligible for the tourist refund, you should explain to the tourist the refund claim process under eTRS. You should explain to the tourist the procedures of obtaining a refund and the handling fee for the refund service imposed by you (if any).

4. You must issue an eTRS transaction to the tourist eligible for GST refund at the time of sale. The tourist can use their passport to apply for their refund claims at the self-help kiosk at the airport.



## Ensuring customers qualify as tourists

To be eligible for GST refund, customers must be **tourists**. Tourists are those who meet the following criteria:

1. The customer is 16 years of age or above on the date of the purchase;
2. The customer is not a citizen or a permanent resident of Singapore;
3. The customer is not a member of the crew of an aircraft on which he is departing Singapore; and
4. The customer is not a Specified Person -


i. on the date of the purchase;


ii. at any time within the period of 3 months immediately before the date of purchase; and


iii. on the date the customer submits their claim for a refund of the GST charged on their purchases at the airport;

(ii) a staff appointed to or employed in an International Organisation, Representative Office or Trade Office in Singapore; or

(iii) a spouse or dependent child of any individual mentioned in B(i) and B(ii) above.

IRAS takes a serious view of foreigners who wilfully make false declarations to seek GST refunds under the Tourist Refund Scheme or abuse the scheme.

## Ensuring tourists are eligible for GST refund

4. Depart with the goods **within 2 months** from the date of purchase via Changi International Airport Departure Hall or Seletar Airport Passenger Terminal;
5. Depart with the goods **within 12 hours** after obtaining approval of the GST refund; and

1. Goods wholly or partly consumed in Singapore;
2. Goods exported for business or commercial purposes;
3. Goods that will be exported by freight; and
4. Accommodation in a hotel, hostel, boarding house, or similar establishments

2. **Make declarations**
1. Declare their eligibility for TRS; and
2. Indicate if the accept TRS conditions.

## Enforcement on fraudulent TRS claims

The eTRS system allows IRAS to detect any unusual claim promptly.

IRAS takes a serious view of foreigners who wilfully make false declarations to seek GST refunds under the tourist refund scheme or abuse the scheme.

### Physical inspection of goods

As a control measure, physical inspection of the goods may be carried out by Singapore Customs officers before a GST refund claim is approved.

### Enforcement powers

IRAS may exercise its enforcement powers to seize the goods and arrest the foreigners who attempt to fraudulently claim GST refunds.

IRAS works closely with Singapore Customs to uncover such criminal syndicates that attempt to defraud GST.

Strong enforcement measures, including prosecution, will be taken against such offenders. When convicted, offenders:

1. May be liable to pay a penalty of up to three times the amount of tax refunded; and
2. May be fined of up to $10,000 and/or jailed up to seven years.
