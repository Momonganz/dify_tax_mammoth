## Price displayed or quoted must be GST-inclusive

GST-registered businesses must show GST-inclusive prices on all price displays to the public (e.g. price tags, price lists, advertisements, publicity brochures, website). Prices that are quoted, whether written or verbal, must be GST-inclusive as the public needs
to know the final price they have to pay upfront.

Failure to comply with price display requirements can result in a fine of up to $5,000.

Quoting the following clauses but not the GST-inclusive prices is **unacceptable** :

1. "Prices stated are subject to GST";
2. "Prices stated are exclusive of GST"; and
3. "Prices stated are before GST".

## Displaying both GST-inclusive & GST-exclusive prices

If both GST-inclusive and GST-exclusive price are displayed, the GST-inclusive price must be displayed at least as prominently as the GST-exclusive price.

## Misleading "no GST" advertising

If you are GST-registered and intend to give a discount equal to the GST amount to the consumer, you should not advertise that there is 'no GST' for the goods or services.

Such advertising is misleading as GST is included in the price after the
discount, and you will still need to account for and pay the GST amount to IRAS.

## Prices subject to bargaining

When the retail price is subject to bargaining, the price displayed or quoted must still be inclusive of GST.

However, the amount of GST to be accounted for by the retailer will be the tax fraction (9/109) of the final price paid by the customer.

[**Example 3: Display prices subject to bargaining**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/basics-of-gst/invoicing-price-display-and-record-keeping/displaying-and-quoting-prices#example-3--display-prices-subject-to-bargaining)

The price displayed is $109 for a given product. The product is subsequently sold at $90 after bargaining.

GST to be accounted for = 9/109 x $90 = $7.43

## Exception to the requirement to display GST-inclusive prices

An exception is granted to hotels and food & beverage (F&B) establishments that impose service charge on their goods and services. They are not required to display GST-inclusive prices to ease their operations.

Otherwise, they may have to display separate price lists for dine-in and take-away items, or to re-compute prices whenever the establishment reduces or waives the service charge.

However, they must still display **a prominent** **statement informing customers that the prices displayed are subject to GST and service charge**.

GST is to be charged on both the amount for the service and the service fee imposed by the supplier.

Please note that the exception does not apply to hotels and F&B establishments that do not impose a service charge. It is also not applicable to F&B establishments that levy a nominal service charge without genuine business reasons other than to avoid displaying GST-inclusive prices. Such businesses are still required to display GST-inclusive prices. Those who do not comply with the price display requirement could be subject to a fine.
