## What is ECI

ECI is an estimate of your company's taxable profits (after deducting tax-allowable expenses) for a Year of Assessment (YA).

Learn about [taxable income](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/taxable-non-taxable-income) and [tax-allowable expenses](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/business-expenses).

**\[UPDATED!\]** As announced in Budget 2024, a [Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Rebate](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-rate-rebates-and-tax-exemption-schemes) of 50% of the corporate tax payable will be granted for YA 2024. The maximum total benefits of CIT Rebate and CIT Rebate Cash Grant that a company may receive for YA 2024 is $40,000. The CIT Rebate applicable to the company for YA 2024 will be automatically computed in the company’s tax assessment based on Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C submitted by the company. As such, assessments raised based on ECI will not factor in the CIT Rebate.

## Determining if Your Company Needs to File ECI

Your company has to file ECI within 3 months from the end of your financial year unless:

1. Your company qualifies for the ECI filing waiver; or
2. Your company is specifically not required to file ECI.

[**ECI Filing Waiver**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/estimated-chargeable-income-(eci)-filing#eci-filing-waiver)

Your company does not need to file ECI in any Year of Assessment (YA) when **both** criteria are met:

1. Annual revenue1 is $5 million or below for the financial year; **and**
2. ECI is nil for the YA. The ECI should be the amount before deducting the exempt amount under the [partial tax exemption scheme](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-rate-rebates-and-tax-exemption-schemes#partial-tax-exemption-scheme-for-companies) or the [tax exemption scheme for new start-up companies](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-rate-rebates-and-tax-exemption-schemes#tax-exemption-scheme-for-new-start-up-companies).

1 Revenue refers to a company's main source of income and excludes separate source income, such as interest, dividend and rental, which does not arise from its principal activity. In the case of an investment holding company, the revenue is
its investment income (e.g. dividend income and interest income).

Your company is required to self-assess if it qualifies for the ECI filing waiver. If your company is new, learn when to [file its first ECI](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/basic-guide-to-corporate-income-tax-for-companies#estimated-chargeable-income--eci--filing).

![Note](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/images/default-source/uploadedimages/note.png?sfvrsn=3cd45ee1_0)

Your company’s ECI filing status for the YA at [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/) may show 'Ready to File'. Nonetheless, if you qualify for the ECI filing waiver, you are not required
to file. **There is no need to seek confirmation from or inform IRAS of the waiver.**

#### Example

For the financial year ending 30 Jun 2022:

| Revenue | ECI | Does my company need to file ECI? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Revenue** $5 million | **ECI** $100,000 | **Does my company need to file ECI?** Yes |
| **Revenue** $10 million | **ECI** Nil | **Does my company need to file ECI?** Yes |
| **Revenue** $5 million | **ECI** Nil | **Does my company need to file ECI?** No |

[**Entities Specifically Not Required to File ECI**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/estimated-chargeable-income-(eci)-filing#entities-specifically-not-required-to-file-eci)

If your company falls within 1 of the following categories, it does not need to file ECI:

- Foreign ship owners or charterers whose local shipping agent has submitted/ will submit the [Shipping Return](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/shipping-return-for-vessels-plying-within-the-limits-of-the-port-of-singapore.pdf?sfvrsn=c4220267_12 "Shipping Return") (PDF, 104KB)
- Foreign universities
- Designated unit trusts and approved CPF unit trusts#
- Real estate investment trusts that have been granted the tax treatment under Section 43(2) of the Income Tax Act 1947
- Cases specifically granted the waiver to furnish ECI by IRAS

# As approved under Section 35(14) of the Income Tax Act 1947 and for the purposes of any investment scheme under the Central Provident Fund Act 1953 respectively. For these unit trusts, the income listed under Sections 35(12) and 35(12A) of the Income
Tax Act 1947 is not taxed at the trustee level. Other income not covered by these Sections is likely to be negligible and hence there is no need for these unit trusts to furnish ECI.

[**FAQs**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/estimated-chargeable-income-(eci)-filing#faqs)

1. **Do I need to file the ECI for my company if it is nil?**

You do not need to file the ECI for your company if it is nil **and** your company's annual revenue is $5 million or below.

If your company's ECI is nil and its annual revenue is more than $5 million, you are still required to file the ECI. You can fill in the ECI to be taxed at 17% as '0' in the digital service.

2. **What will happen if my company fails to file its ECI?**

If your company is required to file its ECI but fails to do so within 3 months from the end of its financial year, a Notice of Assessment may be issued based on an estimation of your company's income.

Find out more about the [estimated Notice of Assessment](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/estimated-chargeable-income-(eci)-filing#estimated-notice-of-assessment).

3. **I received a Notice of Assessment even though my company qualifies for the ECI filing waiver. What should I do?**

IRAS may raise estimated assessments on companies which may not qualify for the ECI filing waiver based on the information available to us. Such situations are rare.

If your company qualifies for the ECI filing waiver but is issued a Notice of Assessment, write in via [myTax Mail](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/) **before the payment due date** to
    confirm that your company's annual revenue is $5 million or below and the ECI is nil for the said Year of Assessment (YA). IRAS will amend the assessment accordingly and no enforcement action will be taken for non-payment of the estimated
    taxes.


4. **Will my company receive a notification to file its ECI?**

Yes, IRAS sends a notification to companies before the end of their financial year on the need to file ECI. If your company assesses that it meets the conditions for the ECI filing waiver, it need not proceed with the filing.

[**When to File ECI**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/estimated-chargeable-income-(eci)-filing#when-to-file-eci)

#### **FILE WITHIN 3 MONTHS FROM END OF FINANCIAL YEAR**

Your company will receive a notification from IRAS to file its ECI in the last month of its financial year.

If your company did not receive the notification and does not satisfy the conditions to be exempted from ECI filing, it is still required to file within 3 months from the end of its financial year.

### Advantages of Filing Early

Enjoy the maximum number of instalments when your company files by the **26th of each qualifying month**. The earlier your company files, the greater the number of instalments it can enjoy. Your company must also be a Singapore-registered
company and be on [GIRO](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-payment/paying-corporate-income-taxes).

| Tax Payable on 1st ECI Filed Within | Number of Instalments Given |
| --- | --- |
| **Tax Payable on 1st ECI Filed Within** 1 month from financial year end | **Number of Instalments Given** 10 |
| **Tax Payable on 1st ECI Filed Within** 2 months from financial year end | **Number of Instalments Given** 8 |
| **Tax Payable on 1st ECI Filed Within** 3 months from financial year end | **Number of Instalments Given** 6 |
| **Tax Payable on 1st ECI Filed Within** After 3 months from financial year end | **Number of Instalments Given** 0 |

Notes

1\. The instalment plan is subject to a minimum monthly GIRO deduction amount of $50.

2\. The 1st instalment may be combined with the 2nd instalment, depending on the date of filing of the ECI. See example 2 below.

3\. IRAS may vary the instalment plan for companies that file revised ECIs.

#### Example 1: Determining the Number of Instalments Given

Company A’s financial year ends in Dec.

| ECI is Filed by | Number of Instalments Given\* |
| --- | --- |
| **ECI is Filed by** 26 Jan | **Number of Instalments Given\*** 10 |
| **ECI is Filed by** 26 Feb | **Number of Instalments Given\*** 8 |
| **ECI is Filed by** 26 Mar | **Number of Instalments Given\*** 6 |
| **ECI is Filed by** After 26 Mar | **Number of Instalments Given\*** 0 |

_\\* The 1st instalment may be combined with the 2nd instalment, depending on the date of filing of ECI. See example 2 below._

#### Example 2: Determining the Date of 1st GIRO Deduction

Following Example 1 above, Company A files its ECI in Jan and 10 instalments are granted for the tax payable of $10,000.

| Filing Date | Between 1 and 20 Jan | Between 21 and 26 Jan |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Filing Date** **1st GIRO deduction will take place on** | **Between 1 and 20 Jan** 6 Feb | **Between 21 and 26 Jan** 6 Mar |
| **Filing Date** **1st Deduction amount** | **Between 1 and 20 Jan** $1,000 | **Between 21 and 26 Jan** $2,000 |
| **Filing Date** **Subsequent deduction** | **Between 1 and 20 Jan** $1,000 will be deducted on the 6th of each month from Mar to Nov. | **Between 21 and 26 Jan** <br>There will be no GIRO deduction on 6 Feb. The instalment amount for Feb and Mar will be deducted together on 6 Mar.<br>$1,000 will be deducted on the 6th of each month from Apr to Nov. |

[**How to Calculate ECI**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/estimated-chargeable-income-(eci)-filing#how-to-calculate-eci)

The ECI amount that your company files should not include the [tax exemption for new start-up companies](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-rate-rebates-and-tax-exemption-schemes#tax-exemption-scheme-for-new-start-up-companies)/

IRAS will compute and allow the tax exemption for new start-up companies/ partial tax exemption automatically.

![](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/images/default-source/uploadedimages/pages/checkbox-with-tick.png?sfvrsn=36c9f14a_0)

Property developers should report their ECI based on the Completed Contracts Method.

#### Example

This is Company A’s Profit and Loss statement for the financial year 2022 (Year of Assessment (YA) 2023):

| Profit and Loss statement | $ |
| Sales | 80,000 |
| Less: Cost of goods sold | (35,000) |
| Gross Profit | 45,000 |
| Other Income: |  |

| **Net Profit before Tax** | **6,645** |

In YA 2023, Company A also purchased:

- A new private car (SJX 123)
- A computer for $1,200
- A filing cabinet for $300

There were no unutilised capital allowances brought forward from the previous YA.

Company A’s ECI is calculated as follows:

| ECI Calculation | $ |

| Less: Separate Source Income |  |
| Rental Income | (1,200) |
| Add: Disallowable Expenses |  |
| Depreciation | 300 |

| [100% Write-Off for Low-Value Asset](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/claiming-allowances/capital-allowances) \- Filing Cabinet | (300) |
| 100% Write-Off in 1 Year for Computer | (1,200) |
| Adjusted profit after Capital Allowances | 4,745 |
| Add: Separate Source Income |  |
| Rental income (net of Property Tax for rental income) | 900 |
| **Estimated Chargeable Income (before exempt amount)** | **5,645** |

1 No capital allowance is given on private cars (e.g. S-plated cars) and business cars (e.g. Q-plated and RU-plated cars).

When filing the ECI, Company A can report its revenue as '$80,000' and the ECI figure as '$5,645' under the 17% tax rate category.

[**How to File ECI**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/estimated-chargeable-income-(eci)-filing#how-to-file-eci)

### Step 1

Do the following before you start filing:

- Ensure that you are duly authorised by your company as an 'Approver' for Corporate Tax (Filing and Applications) in [Corppass](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/). View our [step-by-step guides](https://www.iras.gov.sg/digital-services/companies-tax-agents) for assistance on Corppass setup.
- Have your Singpass as well as your company’s Unique Entity Number (UEN)/ Entity ID.

### Step 2

File ECI via [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx).

For assistance on filing, refer to these guides:

- For Companies: [User Guide - File Estimated Chargeable Income](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/user-guide-(tp)_file-eci.pdf?sfvrsn=61ab641e_18 "User Guide - File Estimated Chargeable Income") (PDF, 590KB)
- For Tax Agents: [User Guide - File Estimated Chargeable Income](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/user-guide-(ta)_file-eci.pdf?sfvrsn=94bbd039_12 "User Guide - File Estimated Chargeable Income") (PDF, 616KB)


### Declaration of Revenue for ECI Filing

Your company's revenue must be declared when filing ECI.

Revenue is a company's main source of income and excludes items such as gain on disposal of fixed assets.

- If your company is an investment holding company, its main source of income is its investment income (e.g. interest and dividend income).
- Where the audited financial statements are not yet available, you may refer to the company’s management accounts for the purpose of declaring the revenue amount. If the actual revenue amount based on the audited financial statements differs
from that declared during the ECI filing, but there is no change in your ECI, you do not need to revise the revenue amount.

[**FAQs**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/estimated-chargeable-income-(eci)-filing#faqs)

1. **Can I still file my company’s ECI if its financial year end shown at mytax.iras.gov.sg or the ECI notification from IRAS is incorrect?**

Yes. You should still proceed to file the ECI.

You should also update the financial year end with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) via [BizFile+](https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/). IRAS will then update its records based
    on the information filed with ACRA.

2. **\[NEW!\] How do I file the ECI if my company has changed its financial year and the change is across Years of Assessment (YA)?**

Where the change is across 2 YAs (e.g. financial year end changed from 31 Dec 2021 to 31 Mar 2022), you need to prepare 2 separate tax computations; 1 for YA 2022 and 1 for YA 2023.

The YAs and corresponding basis periods are as follows:



   - YA 2022: 1 Jan 2021 to 31 Dec 2021

   - YA 2023: 1 Jan 2022 to 31 Mar 2022

   - YA 2024: 1 Apr 2022 to 31 Mar 2023

Your company is required to file the ECI for YA 2022 (basis period from 1 Jan 2021 to 31 Dec 2021) by 31 Mar 2022, and the ECI for YA 2023 (basis period from 1 Jan 2022 to 31 Mar 2022) by 30 Jun 2022.

3. **I am authorised as a Corppass 'Preparer'. Can I file my company’s ECI on its** **behalf?**

As a 'Preparer', you can only enter the ECI amount for your company at [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx). You cannot file the ECI with IRAS.

Only the 'Approver' can file the ECI with IRAS. Therefore, you have to be authorised by your company as an 'Approver' to file the ECI with IRAS.

4. **Can I file my company’s ECI if it has been more than 3 months after its financial year end?**

Yes, you can still file the ECI if a Notice of Assessment for the Year of Assessment (YA) has not been issued to your company. However, your company will not be granted instalments for the payment of the estimated taxes. Instalments are only given
    to Singapore-registered companies that file their ECI within 3 months from the end of their financial year and are on GIRO.

5. **What should I do if I encounter an error while filing the ECI via mytax.iras.gov.sg?**

First, check your filing status by selecting the [View Corporate Tax Filing Status](https://www.iras.gov.sg/digital-services/companies-tax-agents) digital service.

If your status is marked as ‘Ready to File’, clear your browser's cache (temporary Internet files) and close any active application(s) before trying to file again. For instructions on clearing 'cache', refer to Question 2 of the
    [Technical FAQ](https://www.iras.gov.sg/digital-services/others/mytax-portal-technical-faq).

If you still encounter an error, email IRAS via [myTax Mail](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx) with the following details:


   - Date and time that you encountered the error
   - The company’s Unique Entity Number (UEN)/ Entity ID and the individual who is filing
   - Description of the error (e.g. after clicking 'Submit' at Confirmation Statement)
   - The operating system you are using (e.g. Windows XP, Vista)
   - The browser type and version number (e.g. Firefox 2.0, IE 6)
   - The error message(s) or the screenshot of the error(s)

You may also call 1800 356 8622 (local calls only) or 65 6356 8622 for assistance.

6. **As a tax agent, can I file the ECI for multiple clients in a single submission?**

Yes, you can.

For optimal system performance, you should file for a **maximum of 4 clients** per submission. Filing for more clients in a single submission may result in an error or slower processing time.

7. **Will the Notices of Assessments be displayed if I file the ECI for multiple clients in a single submission?**

No. You will receive a consolidated acknowledgement statement for all the clients that you file for in a single submission. The Notices of Assessment will be issued directly to your clients.

8. **Can I get an individual acknowledgement statement for each client if I file the ECI for multiple clients in a single submission?**

No. You have to file the ECI for each company separately in order to receive an individual acknowledgement statement for each company.

9. **How do I calculate the ECI amount to be entered in the File ECI digital service if I have a claim for relief?**

If there is a claim of loss items under the Group Relief System or Loss Carry-Back Relief System, the ECI should be the amount after taking into account the loss items claimed, but before deducting the amount to be exempted under the partial tax
    exemption scheme or tax exemption scheme for new start-up companies.

If there is a claim for foreign tax credit, you may calculate the ECI using the [relevant formula](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/how-to-compute-eci-if-there-is-a-claim-for-relief.pdf?sfvrsn=556445b3_13 "relevant formula") (PDF, 186KB).


## Paying Estimated Tax

You can view your company’s Notice of Assessment at [mytax.iras.gov.sg](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx) after IRAS has processed its ECI filing. The Notice
of Assessment is an official Notice that states the amount of tax to be paid.

No Notice of Assessment will be issued if your company files nil for ECI.

### Difference in ECI Amount Declared and Chargeable Income Reported in Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C

| Chargeable income reported in Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C | Company’s action regarding payment |
| --- | --- |
| **Chargeable income reported in Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C** Less than ECI amount declared earlier | **Company’s action regarding payment** Excess tax paid earlier will be refunded automatically. |
| **Chargeable income reported in Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C** More than ECI amount declared earlier | **Company’s action regarding payment** Pay the additional tax within 1 month from the date of the Notice of Assessment. |

Note: If there is a significant difference between the ECI declared earlier and the chargeable income reported in the Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C subsequently, your company may be required to provide an explanation to IRAS.

[**How to Pay Estimated Tax**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/estimated-chargeable-income-(eci)-filing#how-to-pay-estimated-tax)

There are 2 ways to pay your taxes:

- **Payment by GIRO**

Singapore-registered companies are encouraged to sign up for GIRO
    to enjoy instalment payment arrangements for their estimated tax.
[SIGN UP FOR GIRO 3 WEEKS BEORE FILING ECI](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-payment/paying-corporate-income-taxes)




If your company does not have an existing GIRO arrangement for Corporate Income Tax, [sign up for GIRO](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-payment/paying-corporate-income-taxes) at least 3 weeks **before** filing the ECI. The GIRO arrangement must be approved before the payment due date (i.e. 1 month from the date of the Notice of Assessment) for your company to qualify to pay via instalments.

If the GIRO arrangement is not approved **before the payment due date**, your company will have to pay the full amount of estimated tax within 1 month from the date of the Notice of Assessment.

Check the status of your company's GIRO application through the [Corporate Income Tax integrated phone service](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/pdf/ct_user-and-quick-reference-guide.pdf?sfvrsn=aa692bd7_4 "Corporate Income Tax integrated phone service") (PDF, 371KB).


- **Electronic Payment**

You can make payment through electronic payment methods such as Internet Banking, Phone Banking and NETS. View details on all [electronic payment modes](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/payments).

## Late Filing/ Failure to File ECI

Expand all

[**Estimated Notice of Assessment**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/estimated-chargeable-income-(eci)-filing#estimated-notice-of-assessment)

If your company is late in filing or fails to file its ECI, an estimated Notice of Assessment may be issued based on your company’s past years’ income or other information available to IRAS.

Your company has to [pay the full tax amount](https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/payments) within 1 month from the date of the Notice of Assessment. It will not enjoy instalment payment.

Payment must be made based on the estimated Notice of Assessment even if your company has filed an objection. If the assessment is subsequently revised, any excess payment will be refunded to your company.

Late payment penalties will be imposed and enforcement actions may be taken if payment is not received by the due date.

[**Objection to Estimated Assessment**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/estimated-chargeable-income-(eci)-filing#objection-to-estimated-assessment)
