## Festive Occasions/Special occasions (Cash/Non-Cash)

Cash and non-cash gifts relating to festive and special occasions which do not exceed the exemption threshold of $200 are considered to be not substantial in value and are not taxable due to an administrative concession granted.

If a gift exceeds the exemption threshold, the full value of the gift is taxable. For example, if the baby gift set is worth $250, the taxable value is $250.

The threshold of $200 is applicable per occasion.

### Applying the Exemption Threshold

For example, an employee is given a cash gift of $200 on his wedding, a birthday gift of $50 and a Christmas gift of $80 in the same year.

All gifts are not taxable as the value of each gift does not exceed $200. The birthday gift given to an employee every year is also not taxable if each gift does not exceed $200.
