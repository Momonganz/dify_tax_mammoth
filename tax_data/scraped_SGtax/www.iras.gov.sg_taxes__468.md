Your club/association may face enforcement actions for any late or non-filing of Form P1. The filing due date is 15 Apr each year.

On this page:

## Consequences for late or non-filing of tax returns

Failure to file your Form P1 together with original Audited/Certified Statement of Accounts by the due date is an offence.

IRAS may take the following enforcement actions if you fail to file by the due date:

1. Issue an estimated Notice of Assessment. You must pay the estimated tax within 1 month
2. Offer to compound the offence
3. Issue A Notice To Attend Court/ Summon the club/association or persons responsible for running of the club/association to Court

## Estimated Notice of Assessment

IRAS may issue an estimated Notice of Assessment based on your club/association’s past years’ income or any information that IRAS may have. IRAS may make assumptions in estimating any increase in income.

If you receive an estimated Notice of Assessment, you must:

1. **Pay the estimated tax within 1 month from the date of the Notice of Assessment**

You must pay the estimated tax even if you intend to object to the assessment or are awaiting the outcome of the objection. There will be [penalties for late payment](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/bodiesofpersons/paying-taxes-or-claiming-refunds/Late-payment-or-non-payment-of-income-tax-by-Clubs-and-Associations).

2. **File an objection if you disagree with the estimated tax assessment**

You must file an objection to the assessment within 2 months from the date of the Notice of Assessment.



When filing the objection, you must submit
    the Form P1 and Original Audited/Certified Statement of Accounts. Otherwise, the estimated assessment will not be revised.



If all the documents are submitted, your objection to the estimated tax assessment will be reviewed and excess
    tax paid will be refunded.

## Offer of composition

Instead of taking prosecution actions, IRAS may allow you to avoid prosecution by paying a composition amount.

A composition amount not exceeding $5,000 for each offence may be offered depending on your clubs/association’s past compliance records. A notice will be sent to inform your club/association of the composition amount. You must pay the composition
amount and file the overdue tax return and documents by the due date to avoid prosecution.

### Paying the composition amount

Quote the payment slip number when paying the composition amount using the preferred [payment modes](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/bodiesofpersons/paying-taxes-or-claiming-refunds/how-to-pay).

GIRO payment is not allowed.

The payment will be processed after 3 working days.

Legal actions may still be taken against your club/association if you do not file the outstanding tax return after paying the composition amount. The payment made will be used to settle any unpaid tax.

### Appealing for waiver of composition amount

Appeals can be made via email to [enfmisctax@iras.gov.sg](mailto: enfmisctax@iras.gov.sg). Appeals will only be considered if:

1. You have submitted the outstanding tax returns and/or documents by the due date stated in the offer of composition; and
2. You have filed your tax return on time for the past 2 years

## Court summons

A summons may be issued to the club/association to attend Court on a specified date if IRAS does not receive:

1. The required tax return by the due date
2. Payment of the composition amount by the due date

If you do not wish to attend Court, you must do all of the following actions at least 1 week before the Court date:

1. File the outstanding tax return and/or documents
2. Pay the composition amount

### Postponement of Court hearing

If you need more time to file and/or pay the composition amount, your club/association’s representative, must attend Court on the Court date with a Letter of Authorisation to appeal for postponement.

### Attending Court

Failure to attend Court will result in further legal actions taken against the club/association (i.e. a warrant of arrest may be issued against the club’s president).

In Court, if convicted of the offence, the club/association may face a fine not exceeding $5,000 for each offence.

You must still file the outstanding tax returns and/or documents. Otherwise, further legal actions may be taken.

### Failure to file your tax returns for 2 or more years

If you fail to file your tax returns for 2 years or more, you may be issued with a summons to attend Court. On conviction in Court, for each offence, you may be ordered to pay:

1. A penalty that is twice the amount of tax assessed; and
2. A fine not exceeding $5,000
