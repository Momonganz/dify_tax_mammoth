4. Imports must be supported by import permits which show you as the importer of the goods;
5. The goods or services must be used for the making of taxable supplies (i.e. [standard-rated supplies](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/charging-gst-(output-tax)/when-to-charge-goods-and-services-tax-(gst) "standard-rated supplies") and
    [zero-rated supplies](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/charging-gst-(output-tax)/when-to-charge-0-gst-(zero-rate) "zero-rated supplies")) or [out-of-scope supplies](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/charging-gst-(output-tax)/when-is-gst-not-charged/out-of-scope-supplies "out-of-scope supplies") (e.g. third country sale of goods), which would be taxable supplies if made in Singapore, in the course or furtherance of your business;
6. The input tax claims are not disallowed under Regulations 26 and 27 of the GST (General) Regulations; and

### Pre-registration GST Incurred on Goods

In addition to satisfy the general input tax rules, you must satisfy all of the following conditions:

1. For goods acquired within 6 months before the date of your GST registration, the goods are still held by your business at GST registration; and

[**Example 1: Trading stock**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/claiming-gst-incurred-before-gst-registration-incorporation#example-1--trading-stock)

GST incurred on your trading goods is not claimable if the goods have been sold prior to your GST registration date.


2. For goods acquired more than 6 months before the date of your GST registration, the goods have not been consumed (i.e. used) or supplied by your business before the date of your GST registration


[**Example 2: F&B and hotel accommodation**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/claiming-gst-incurred-before-gst-registration-incorporation#example-2--f-b-and-hotel-accommodation)

GST incurred on food and beverages consumed by your staff and hotel accommodation incurred by your staff before your GST registration are not claimable.


### Pre-registration GST Incurred on Property Rental, Utilities and Services

In addition to satisfying the general input tax rules, you must satisfy all of the following conditions:

1. The expenses are incurred by your business within 6 months before the date of your GST registration; and
2. The expenses are not directly attributable to supplies made by your business before the date of your GST registration

[**Example 3: General administrative expenses**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/claiming-gst-incurred-before-gst-registration-incorporation#example-3--general-administrative-expenses)

GST incurred on your office rental, utilities and maintenance services for your business premises are not directly attributable to supplies made before registration.


### Apportionment of Pre-Registration GST

Pre-registration GST is allowable only to the extent that the goods or services acquired are used or to be used for taxable supplies made after GST registration.

If some of the goods **acquired within 6 months** before your GST registration date have been sold, transferred or disposed of, you are required to apportion the GST incurred according to the actual units held at your registration
date.

If the goods acquired by you **more than 6 months** before your GST registration date have been used to make supplies straddling your GST registration (i.e. supplies before and after GST registration) or have been partially consumed
before your GST registration, you are required to apportion the GST incurred.

Similarly, if the services, property rental or utilities acquired by you are **used to make supplies straddling your GST registration**, you are required to apportion the GST incurred. Only the portion of GST that is attributable to
the supplies made after registration is claimable.

For information on the various apportionment methods, refer to " [GST: Pre-registration Claims on Goods and Services (For Businesses Registered for GST on or after 1 July 2015)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/gst-pre-registration-claims-on-goods-and-services-(businesses-registered-on-or-after-1-july-2015).pdf?sfvrsn=34c8c3e_40 "GST: Pre-Registration Claims on Goods and Services (Businesses Registered on or after 1 July 2015) (Third Edition)")" (PDF, 424KB).

![Pre-registration timeline](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/images/default-source/uploadedimages/pages/pre-registration-input-tax-claims.png?sfvrsn=12c7955_0)

For your company to claim the GST incurred for such purchases:

1. The purchases must have been intended for use by your company to make taxable supplies after GST registration. If so, the purchases by the individual would be treated as business purchases by your company; and

[**Example 5: Legal fees for incorporation**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/claiming-gst-incurred-before-gst-registration-incorporation#example-5--legal-fees-for-incorporation)

Mr. X incurred GST on legal fees in the course of incorporating your company. The GST incurred by Mr. X would be treated as GST incurred by the company if:

1. Mr. X became a member, officer or employee of the incorporated company;
2. Mr. X is reimbursed or received an undertaking to be reimbursed by the company for the full amount paid for the goods and services;
3. Mr. X was not GST-registered at the time of the purchase; and
4. The purchases were acquired for your company's business and are not used or to be used for any other purposes.

2. The purchases (treated as purchases by the company) must satisfy all the conditions for [claiming pre-registration GST](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/claiming-gst-incurred-before-gst-registration-incorporation "claiming GST incurred before GST registration").

To claim the GST incurred prior to the incorporation of your company, please write-in to IRAS for approval with your confirmation that all the above-mentioned conditions are satisfied. Upon approval, your company may claim the GST incurred in your first
GST return.

## Determining when GST is Incurred

The time at which GST is incurred is determined according to your supplier's [time of supply](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/charging-gst-(output-tax)/when-to-report-supplies-in-gst-returns "time of supply").
