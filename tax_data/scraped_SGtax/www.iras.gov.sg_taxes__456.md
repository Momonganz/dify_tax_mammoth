## Notifying IRAS on the Start of Lease

When you let out your property, you need to inform IRAS within 15 days after the letting for property tax purpose. When the lease document is e-Stamped via our [e-Stamping Portal](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/estamping/ "e-Stamping Portal"), IRAS will be notified of the rental and you need not inform IRAS separately.

If your tenant is liable to e-Stamp the rental agreement (including rental agreements for rental of rooms), you can request for a copy of the stamp certificate from your tenant to ensure that the rental agreement has been stamped. For details on Stamp
Duty on leases of properties, please refer to [Renting a Property](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/stamp-duty/for-property/renting-a-property).

The penalty for non-compliance of the above obligation is a fine of up to $5,000 and an interest on the tax at such rate as may be prescribed (if any).

## Notifying IRAS on the Increase in Rent

When there is an increase in rent on the existing tenancy agreement, you do not need to update IRAS separately for property tax purpose if the document (e.g. Variation of Lease or Supplemental Agreement) has been e-Stamped via our [e-Stamping Portal](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/estamping/ "e-Stamping Portal") within 15 days after the increase. For details on Stamp Duty on leases of properties, please refer to [Renting\\
a Property](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/stamp-duty/for-property/renting-a-property).

If e-Stamping is not required or will only be performed beyond 15 days after the increase, you will be required to [inform IRAS](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/portal/correspondence/mytax-mail) for property tax purpose within 15 days after the increase. The penalty for non-compliance is a fine of up to $5,000 and an interest on the tax at such rate as may be prescribed (if any).

## Renting out your Whole Residential Property

The [owner-occupiers tax rates](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/property-tax/property-owners/property-tax-reliefs/lower-property-tax-rates-for-owner-occupied-residential-properties "Owner-occupiers tax rates") (if applied on your property)
will be withdrawn from the date of letting. You will need to pay higher property tax based on the [non-owner-occupier residential tax rates](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/property-tax/property-owners/property-tax-rates#title3 "non-owner-occupier residential tax rates").


If you partially-let out your home while you continue to live in it, your residential property remains eligible for the [owner-occupier tax rates](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/property-tax/property-owners/property-tax-reliefs/lower-property-tax-rates-for-owner-occupied-residential-properties "owner-occupier tax rates") to apply.

## Reinstating Owner-Occupier Tax Rates at the End of Lease

Upon the end of the tenancy, property owners must reapply for owner-occupier tax rates to be applied to their property if they have moved back into that property. Owner-Occupier tax rates will **NOT** be automatically applied upon the end of a tenancy. To apply, you can use our **['Apply/ Withdraw Owner-Occupier Tax Rates'](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/portal/property/owner-occupier-tax-rate)** digital service.

This applies to early termination of tenancy as well. If there is an existing lease on your property and you are planning to reside in your property after the lease has been pre-terminated, please apply for the owner-occupier tax rates by **[writing to us](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/portal/correspondence/mytax-mail)** with supporting documents to show that the lease has been pre-terminated.

The following are some examples of supporting documents# that you can provide to show that the lease has been pre-terminated:

1. Tenancy Termination Agreement (e.g. tenant departure slip etc.)
2. HDB termination letter
3. Message between tenant/ agent and owner (e.g. Email/ Instant Messaging)
4. Electricity bill showing the utility account/ utility bill opening
5. SP services’ email showing the date of account opening
6. Approval for commencement of renovation (e.g. Renovation contract)
7. Any bills/ correspondences showing that you have moved into the property    (e.g.mover’s invoice etc.)

#You may wish to note that the list of supporting documents is not exhaustive and we will consider your application as long as you are able to show that the lease on your property has been pre-terminated.

If owners choose not to move back into the flat and leave it vacant, non-owner-occupier residential tax rates will continue to be applied.

## Pay Income Tax on Rental Income Received

The rent that you receive from renting out your property in Singapore may be subject to Income Tax. Income Tax is a tax payable on all income earned or received in Singapore, including any payout or profit arising from investments unless the investments
are specifically exempted under the Income Tax Act. There is no double taxation since Property Tax and Income Tax are two separate taxes.

Property tax is imposed based on ownership of property, while income tax is being taxed on the rental income earned. Hence, you are not being taxed twice for ownership of property.

Property tax is levied on the ownership of properties, irrespective of whether the property is occupied or vacant. There is no relief for vacant properties and the tax rates will be based on non-owner-occupier residential tax rates for vacant residential
properties while non-residential properties will be based on 10% of the Annual Value.
