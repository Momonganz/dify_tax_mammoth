## Tax on Legal Personal Representative (LPR)

The statutory income of a LPR (administrator/executor) is subject to income tax at the following flat rate:

| Year of Assessment (YA) | Tax Rate |
| --- | --- |
| **Year of Assessment (YA)** From YA 2010 | **Tax Rate** 17% |

## Tax on beneficiaries if income is distributed

Tax on the estate income can be paid by Singapore resident beneficiaries at their **personal tax rates** instead of the tax rate of a LPR if the distribution conditions are met.

**_Conditions applicable to Years of Assessment 2023 and before_**

For income earned in a basis period and brought to tax in the hands of the LPR in the relevant Year of Assessment applicable to the basis period, the income has to be received by, distributed to or applied to the benefit of the Singapore resident beneficiaries **before 31 Mar in the year following the Year of Assessment.**
