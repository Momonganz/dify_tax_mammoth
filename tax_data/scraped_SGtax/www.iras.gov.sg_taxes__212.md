## FAQs

[**My company has been struck off and I am no longer able to view the companyâ€™s Corporate Tax Notices at mytax.iras.gov.sg. May I request for a duplicate copy of the tax documents of my company via post?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/obtaining-a-copy-of-documents-issued-by-iras#my-company-has-been-struck-off-and-i-am-no-longer-able-to-view-the-company-s-corporate-tax-notices-at-mytax-iras-gov-sg--may-i-request-for-a-duplicate-copy-of-the-tax-documents-of-my-company-via-post-)

A company ceases to exist when it has been struck off. The duplicate document request service via post is not available to a company that no longer exists. Should your company require its Corporate Tax Notices, you must download and save the Notices prior to its strike off with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA).
