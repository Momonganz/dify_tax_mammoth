You can zero-rate (i.e. charge GST at 0%) your supply of goods if you are certain that at the point of supply (based on the [time of supply for exports](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/charging-gst-(output-tax)/when-to-charge-0-gst-(zero-rate)/exporting-of-goods#title1)) :

1. The goods supplied will be exported or have been exported; and
2. You have the required documents to support zero-rating.

To determine the list of documents to be maintained to support the zero-rating of the supply of goods, you have to assess which is the scenario in [GST: Guide on Exports](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguides_gst_exports_2013-12-31(1).pdf?sfvrsn=ecabfc4b_36) (PDF, 805KB) that your export arrangement falls under.

On this page:

## Time of supply for exports

For the purpose of zero-rating, the time of supply occurs at the earlier of the following events:

- Issuance of an invoice
- Receipt of payment

## Direct and indirect exports

### A. Direct exports

Occurs when:

- You have custody of the goods to be exported; and
- You control the export arrangement.

Direct exports may be **zero-rated** if the required documents to support zero-rating are maintained within 60 days.

[**Examples of direct exports**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/charging-gst-(output-tax)/when-to-charge-0-gst-(zero-rate)/exporting-of-goods#examples-of-direct-exports)

The scenarios listed below are some examples of direct exports:

- You export the goods via your appointed freight forwarder/handling agent/postal or courier company and invoice your overseas customer.
- You export the goods via your appointed freight forwarder/handling agent upon instruction of your local customer and invoice your local customer.
- Your goods are consolidated by your appointed freight forwarder/handling agent before the goods are exported and you invoice your overseas customer.

Please refer to the [GST: Guide on Exports](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguides_gst_exports_2013-12-31(1).pdf?sfvrsn=ecabfc4b_36 "GST: Guide on Exports") (PDF, 805KB) for other direct export scenarios and required documents to support zero-rating for each scenario.

### B. Indirect exports

Indirect exports occur when:

- You do not have custody of the goods to be exported; or
- You do not have control over the export arrangement.

You must treat the sale as a local standard-rated supply (i.e. charge and account GST at 9%).

### Exceptions for indirect exports

However, you can zero-rate the supply of goods if:

- You are certain at the time of supply that all the goods will be exported; and
- The required documents to support zero-rating can be maintained within 60 days.

[**Examples of indirect exports**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/charging-gst-(output-tax)/when-to-charge-0-gst-(zero-rate)/exporting-of-goods#examples-of-indirect-exports)

The scenarios listed below are some examples of indirect exports:

1. You invoice your overseas customer and deliver the goods to the freight forwarder/handling agent appointed by your overseas customer.
2. You invoice the overseas customer and instruct your local supplier to deliver the goods to the overseas customer.

Please refer to [GST: Guide on Exports](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguides_gst_exports_2013-12-31(1).pdf?sfvrsn=ecabfc4b_36 "GST: Guide on Exports") (PDF, 805KB) for other indirect export scenarios and the specific documents that must be maintained to support zero-rating for each scenario.

## 60-day rule for exported goods

When exporting goods, you have up to 60 days from the
[time of supply](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/charging-gst-(output-tax)/when-to-report-supplies-in-gst-returns "time of supply") to export the goods and collate the required export documents. Failure to do so within this time frame will require you to standard-rate the supply of goods (i.e. charge and account GST at 9%).

There are exceptions to the 60-day rule. Please refer to the
[GST: Guide on Exports](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguides_gst_exports_2013-12-31(1).pdf?sfvrsn=ecabfc4b_36 "GST: A Guide on Exports") (PDF,
805KB) for more information.
