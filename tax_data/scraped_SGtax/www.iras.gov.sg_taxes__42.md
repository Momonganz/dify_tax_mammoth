| --- | --- |
| Estate Duty is payable on the total market value of all his Singapore immovable and movable assets as at the date of death and exemptions will be given. | 1.

## Reliefs and Exemptions

1. ### Quick Succession Relief (QSR)


If two people pass away on or after 01 Jan 2006, and the later death occurred not more than 24 months after the earlier death, the estate of the later death is entitled to QSR.

Where the order of the two deaths is unknown, the younger person is presumed to have survived the older person and inherited the older person's assets.

Each estate is assessed separately and the exemptions under the Estate Duty Act will apply separately on each assessment.

1. #### Relief for Deaths in Quick Succession


      For all quick succession deaths, a relief of varying amount would be given depending on the time period between the two deaths, as shown in the table below.



      | Period Between Two Deaths | Percentage Of Relief |
      | --- | --- |
      | 6 months or less | 100% |
      | More than 6 months but not more than 12 months | 75% |
      | More than 12 months but not more than 18 months | 50% |
      | More than 18 months but not more than 24 months | 25% |
      | More than 24 months | 0% |

2. #### Formula for Calculating Relief


      The formula is: **A/B x C x P**



      | A | The assessed value of that part of the transferred property on which estate duty has been paid on the earlier death or the assessed value of the same part of the transferred property on which estate duty is payable on the later<br> death, whichever is the lower. |
      | B | The assessed value of the estate of the later deceased. |
      | C | The amount of the estate duty payable on the deceased. |
      | P | The percentage of remission at the applicable rate set out in the previous table. |
2. ### Exemptions
