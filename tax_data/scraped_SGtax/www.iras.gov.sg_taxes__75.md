Not all businesses are registered for GST. **Only GST-registered businesses are allowed to charge and collect GST** on the goods and services you purchase from them. You may wish to use our e-Service to [check if a particular business is registered for GST](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/consumers/checking-if-a-business-is-gst-registered "check if a particular business is registered for GST") .

GST is charged on the final value (inclusive of service charge, if any) of any goods or services consumed in Singapore.

Prices displayed by GST-registered businesses should be the **final prices** (i.e. GST-inclusive) that you are paying. GST-registered businesses are not allowed to display, quote, advertise or publish prices without GST. If both GST-inclusive
and GST-exclusive prices are displayed, the GST-inclusive price must be displayed at least as prominently as the GST-exclusive price. Those who do not comply with the price display requirement could be subject to a fine.

### Example:

The following illustrates the types of price display that are acceptable and unacceptable:

| Price display format |
| --- |
| **Acceptable** | **Not acceptable** |
| $109 | $100 + |
| $109 w/GST<br>$109 (inclusive of GST) | $100 + GST<br>$100 + 9% GST<br>$100 + $9 GST |
| $109 w/GST ($100)<br>**$109** w/GST ($100) | $109 w/GST **($100)** |
| **$109 w/GST**<br>($100 w/o GST) | **$100 w/o GST**<br>($109 w/GST) |

An **exception** is granted to **hotels and food & beverage (F&B) establishments** that impose service charge on their goods and services. These businesses may display GST-exclusive prices for goods and services
that are subject to service charge to ease their operations. Otherwise, they may have to display separate price lists for dine-in and take-away items, or to re-compute prices whenever the establishment reduces or waives the service charge.

However, they must still display a prominent statement informing customers that the prices displayed are subject to GST and service charge.

Please note that the exception does not apply to hotels and F&B establishments that do not impose a service charge. It is also not applicable to F&B establishments that levy a nominal service charge without genuine business reasons other than
to avoid displaying GST-inclusive prices.  Such businesses are still required to display GST-inclusive prices. Those who do not comply with the price display requirement could be subject to a fine.
