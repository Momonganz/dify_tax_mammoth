2.  Level of furniture and fittings, i.e. fully furnished or partially furnished
3.  Number of days accommodation is provided by the employer
4.  Number of employees living / sharing the accommodation
5.  Rent paid by employee (if any)
6.  Type of accommodation (e.g. apartment or hotel)

[**Where can I get information on the AV of the property?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/employers/understanding-the-tax-treatment/accommodation-and-related-benefits#where-can-i-get-information-on-the-av-of-the-property-)

The AV is the estimated annual rent of the property if it is rented out, excluding the furniture, furnishings and maintenance fees. The annual value of a property can be found on the property tax bill or via IRAS' [e-Valuation List service.](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/property-tax/property-professionals/real-estate-housing-agents/find-out-annual-values "e-Valuation List service.")

While IRAS usually reviews the AV yearly, if there is an adjustment of AV during the year, you have to take into account of the changes in determining the AV for the purpose of computing the taxable value of accommodation.

[**How are the 40% and 50% arrived at as the basis of computing the value of furnishing for the partially furnished and fully furnished property?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/employers/understanding-the-tax-treatment/accommodation-and-related-benefits#how-are-the-40--and-50--arrived-at-as-the-basis-of-computing-the-value-of-furnishing-for-the-partially-furnished-and-fully-furnished-property-)

The percentages are determined based on inputs gathered from a survey conducted for key industry players on the provision of furniture and fittings.

[**The landlord has provided lighting fixtures but not an air-conditioner or fan. Is this unit considered unfurnished or partially furnished?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/employers/understanding-the-tax-treatment/accommodation-and-related-benefits#the-landlord-has-provided-lighting-fixtures-but-not-an-air-conditioner-or-fan--is-this-unit-considered-unfurnished-or-partially-furnished-)

A partially furnished unit is defined as one that is provided with fittings such as lightings, water-heater, air-conditioner and/or ceiling fan. A unit that is fitted with any of these or similar items will be considered as partially furnished.

Therefore, the value of furniture and fittings of this unit is to be determined based on 40% of AV of the unit.

[**Can employers use the actual rent paid instead of AV of the property to report the accommodation benefits?**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/employers/understanding-the-tax-treatment/accommodation-and-related-benefits#can-employers-use-the-actual-rent-paid-instead-of-av-of-the-property-to-report-the-accommodation-benefits-)

From YA 2015 till YA 2019, employers are required to use the AV to compute taxable accommodation benefits. Instead of AV, employers may also use the actual market rent paid for the accommodation to report the housing benefit, if it is administratively more convenient to do so. This also applies to cases where the AV is unavailable.

From YA 2020 onwards, employers are required to use the actual rent paid to report the accommodation benefits if the property is rented by the employer. Alternatively, if the employers do not pay any rent (e.g. where the property is owned by the employer), employers can continue to use AV of the property to report the accommodation benefits and the value of furniture and fittings is to be determined based on 40% (partially furnished) or 50% (fully furnished) of AV of the property.

#### Reporting actual rent

If employers use the actual rent paid for furnished units, they are to report the full rent for the property (including furniture and fittings).

#### Example 1: Actual rent and  amount of furniture and fittings are provided

Where a tenancy agreement stipulates that the monthly rental is $3,000 for the property and $1,600 for the furniture and fittings, the amount to be reported as actual rent paid by employer would be $4,600. If the period of occupation is 10 months, the total amount of rent paid to be reported would be $46,000 (i.e. $4,600 x 10). The taxable value for the accommodation benefit is $46,000.

#### Example 2: Only monthly rental amount is provided

Where the monthly rental is $5,000 and there is no breakdown of the rental paid for the property and furniture and fittings, the amount to be reported as actual rent paid by employer would be $5,000. If the period of occupation is 12 months, the total amount of rent paid to be reported would be $60,000 (i.e. $5,000 x 12). The taxable value of the accommodation benefit is $60,000.

#### Example 3: Additional cost for rental of furniture and fittings

Where the monthly rental is $5,000 and the landlord provides some furniture and fittings at the property and the employer incurs a monthly rental of $500 for leasing additional furniture and fittings for the unit, the amount to be reported as actual rent paid by employer would be $5,500. This is regardless of whether the rental of the additional furniture and fittings is paid by the employer directly or by the employee but reimbursed by the employer. If the period of occupation is 12 months, the taxable value of the accommodation benefit is $5,500 per month and $66,000 (i.e. $5,500 x 12) per year.

For all the three scenarios, employers are not required to report the value of benefit for furniture and fittings separately as the gross rent (or together with the separate leasing of furniture and fittings) is inclusive of the value for the furniture and fittings.
