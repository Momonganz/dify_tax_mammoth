[**Example 1: Withholding Tax paid by non-resident professional**](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/withholding-tax/payments-to-non-resident-professional-(consultant-trainer-coach-etc-)/treatment-of-income-for-non-resident-professional#example-1--withholding-tax-paid-by-non-resident-professional)

The non-resident professional is engaged by a company to render services in Singapore for seven days. Besides an engagement fee of $5,000, the non-resident professional is also provided with hotel accommodation @ $200 a day and airfare of $2,000.

| Gross Fees | Accommodation ($200 x 7 days) | Airfare | Total Gross Income/Fees | Final Withholding Tax @ 15% |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Gross Fees** <br>$ 5,000 | **Accommodation ($200 x 7 days)** <br>$ 1,400 | **Airfare** <br>$ 2,000 | **Total Gross Income/Fees** <br>$ 8,400 | **Final Withholding Tax @ 15%** <br>$ 1,260 |

If the payer bears the tax for the non-resident professional under contractual terms (i.e. payment to payee is treated as net of tax), the withholding tax would be computed on a re-grossed basis.

The payer remains responsible for the payment of withholding tax which will be calculated at the rate of 15% of the re-grossed amount.

Under the terms of engagement, the income of $8,400 (as shown in example 1) is net of Singapore withholding tax. Hence, it is to be re-grossed at the rate of 15%:

$8,400 x 100% = $9,882.35

85% _\*_

Payer is required to account for withholding tax at the rate of 15% on the re-grossed amount: $9,882.35 x 15% = $1,482.35.

## Option to be Taxed on Net Income at 22% (24% for income due and payable to the non-resident professional with effect from 1 Jan 2023)

The non-resident professional can opt to be taxed on the **net income** (i.e. gross fee less allowable expenses) at the non-resident rate of 22% (24% for income due and payable to the non-resident professional with effect from
1 Jan 2023) instead of 15% of the gross income.

Under this option:

**Income Due and Payable To The Non-resident Professional On Or Before 31 Oct 2022**

Income

1. As a concession, the following are not taxable:

   - cost of airfare borne by the **payer** and
   - cost of accommodation (excluding value of food) provided/reimbursed by the **payer** for short-term engagement of 60 days or less in a calendar year. Where the period of engagement is more than 60 days in the same calendar year,
      the cost of the accommodation is taxable. For example, engagement period was 70 days in a calendar year and accommodation was provided. The full cost of accommodation is taxable.

Expenses

2. Only expenses which are wholly and exclusively incurred by the non-resident professional in the production of the Singapore-sourced income and which are not reimbursed by the payer are tax deductible.



Private expenses (e.g. value of food
    and ground transfers from and to airport) and expenses incurred to put the non-resident professional in a position to earn the income (e.g. transport expenses incurred from hotel to venue of service and back) are not deductible.

3. As a concession, the following expenses incurred by the **non-resident professional** are deductible:


   - Cost of airfare and
   - Cost of accommodation (excluding value of food) for short-term engagement(s) with total period of 60 days or less in a calendar year. Where the total periods in one or more period of engagement(s) in the same calendar year exceeds 60 days,
      the full value of the accommodation is not deductible. For example, if the non-resident professional pays for the accommodation and the engagement period for the same calendar year was 70 days, the full value of the accommodation is not
      deductible.

**Income Due and Payable To The Non-resident Professional On Or After 1 Nov 2022**

**NEW** The above administrative concessions in paragraphs 1 and 3 will be withdrawn for income due and payable to the non-resident professional on or after 1  Nov 2022. With the withdrawal, the following rules apply:

(a) Taxability of Income

- Cost of airfare borne by the payer and cost of accommodation provided/reimbursed by the payer - Such income that is due and payable to the non-resident professional from 1  Nov 2022 onwards will be taxable, regardless of the period of engagement
in a calendar year.


(b) Deductibility of Expenses

- Only expenses which are wholly and exclusively incurred by the non-resident professional in the production of the Singapore-sourced income, and not private or capital in nature, are tax deductible. Private expenses such as value of food are not deductible.


- The costs of airfare and accommodation (excluding value of food) incurred by the non-resident professional in respect of income due and payable on or after 1  Nov 2022 will be deductible against the gross income of the non-resident professional,
regardless of the period of engagement in a calendar year.  This is provided that the following conditions are met:
1. The non-resident professional’s principal place of business is outside Singapore;
2. The non-resident professional was carrying on the same activity prior to his trip to Singapore; and
3. The sole purpose of the non-resident professional’s trip to Singapore is to perform the services in Singapore.
- Business expenses such as cost of ground transfers from and to airport and transport from hotel to venue of service and back are deductible against the gross income of the non-resident professional.

If the payer bears the tax for the non-resident professional under contractual terms (i.e. payment to payee is treated as net of tax), the withholding tax would be computed on a re-grossed basis.

The payer remains responsible for the payment of the withholding tax which will be calculated at the rate of 22%# of the re-grossed amount.

Under the terms of engagement, the income of $8,400 (as shown in example 4b) is net of Singapore withholding tax. Hence, it is to be re-grossed at the rate of 22%#:

$8,400 x 100% = $10,769.23



78%\*


Payer is required to account for the withholding tax at the rate of 22%# on the re-grossed amount: $10,769.23 x 22%# = $2,369.23.
