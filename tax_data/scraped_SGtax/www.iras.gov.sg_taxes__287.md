## Non second-hand motor vehicle dealers

You should use the Discounted Sale Price Scheme when you occasionally sell a vehicle that you have used in your business.

## Second-hand motor vehicle dealers

You should use the Discounted Sale Price Scheme in the following situations:

1. You do not satisfy the requirements for the use of the Gross Margin Scheme on the sale of your second-hand vehicle (e.g. your second-hand vehicle was purchased from a GST-registered supplier who did not use the Gross Margin Scheme on the sale made to you); or

2. Your customer is GST-registered. In such situation, selling under the Discounted Sale Price Scheme will enable your customer to claim the GST incurred if it is a commercial vehicle (subject to
    [conditions for claiming input tax](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/claiming-gst-(input-tax)/conditions-for-claiming-input-tax "conditions for claiming input tax") ).



Another method to charge GST on second-hand motor vehicles is the Gross Margin Scheme.Â For more information, please visit our webpage on [Gross Margin Scheme](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/general-gst-schemes/gross-margin-scheme).
