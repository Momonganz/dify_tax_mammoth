## Zero-rating of supplies

In general, the supply of local telecommunication services is a standard-rated supply.

**Prescribed telecommunication services**

You can zero-rate your supply of telecommunication services, whether it is made to an overseas or a local person, if the services:

- Are prescribed in the Fifth Schedule of the GST (International Services) Order, and
- Comprise the provision of telecommunications transmitted:



(a) Into and out of Singapore; or



(b) Outside Singapore.


Examples of prescribed services include the provision of voice transmission services through phone lines/mobile phones, satellite services, messaging services such as SMS and MMS. Such services can only be zero-rated if they involve international transmission.
